 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on Tuesday denounced a new Republican campaign commercial ridiculing him for riding in an Army tank and asserted that `` we Democrats are for a strong defense.'' The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor toured friendly territory in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> suburbs in a state where h found discouraging polls showing GOP rival <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> leading in the presidential race. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> responded by taking virtually every opportunity to appear on network television, while refusing to hold a news conference or take questions from reporters traveling with him. He was appearing on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Nightline'' program Tuesday night for a 90-minute interview with <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Koppel </PERSON>, who was meeting him in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' wife and children appeared on <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON>'s program Aides said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would be interviewed by <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rather </PERSON> on Thursday's <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evening </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> program in a session expected to last 14 minutes _ extraordinarily long for an evening news show. His running mate, Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, was to be interviewed on the same program for eight minutes Wednesday. `` Now they've got a tank ad _ has all kinds of misstatements and outright falsehoods,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` We Democrats are for a strong defense.'' The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign's tank ad uses videotape of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> wearing a helmet and riding in the turrent of an M-1 tank at a defense contractor's plant in <LOCATION> Sterling </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, last month, and suggests that he is weak on defense. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said the tank ad is part of `` the distortions, the lies and the misrepresentations we've had in this campaign _ and there have been many.'' His campaign advisers vigorously denied the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ad's contention that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> opposes virtually every new weapons system. Campaign manager <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> favors the Trident II missile, the advanced cruise missile, the Seawolf attack submarine, the C-17 transport aircraft and the YF-22 A @ 23A advanced tactical fighter. `` There are lies, damn lies and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s commercials,'' she said. Press secretary <PERSON> Dayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> said the ad wrongly claims that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> opposes the Stealth bomber. `` That's a lie,'' he said. He also said the governor was wrongly accused of opposing several missile systems. On the second day of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' tour of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, a new front-page poll by the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> showed him falling further behind <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in this state whose 47 electoral votes are crucial to the Democrats' chances of victory on Nov. 8. The poll showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> leading <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> among likely voters by 53 percent to 42 percent, with only 4 percent undecided. The survey of 1,376 people had a margin of error or plus or minus four percentage points. Some <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign staffers and advisers privately acknowledged the Times survey was within a few points of their own figures. Battling the perception that <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> was slipping beyond his grasp, the Democratic nominee campaigned in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area, one of his strongest pockets of support, before large, enthusiastic crowds. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> addressed about 2,500 people at <ORGANIZATION> Diablo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> and toured a day care center affiliated with the two-year community college. He spoke Monday night at a town meeting in another suburb and before a raucus crowd of precinct workers crowded into a gymnasium near <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> delivered stump speeches laced with populist appeals and denunciations of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign tactics. <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> said internal campaign polling showed the complaints about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign tactics were beginning to register among voters. `` Our polling shows by overwhelming margins people are blaming <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for the negative campaign,'' <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> said. In addition to personal TV appearances by the Democratic candidates, the campaign bought five minutes of air time on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> starting at 9:55 p.m. EDT on Tuesday and repeated a five-minute commercial aired Saturday night accusing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of waging a fear-and-smear campaign. Emerging Tuesday from a 20-minute meeting with local black ministers and political figures, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> dismissed reporters' questions about the polls `` We're just going to work hard, and we're going to win,'' he shouted.

 An Aeroperu plane carrying 69 people crashed seconds after takeoff Tuesday from an Andes airport and airline officials said 12 people were killed, including an American and three Europeans. Aeroperu spokesman <PERSON> Freddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirinos </PERSON> said 56 people were injured and one person could not be accounted for. Survivors said there was an explosion aboard the Dutch-built <ORGANIZATION> Fokker </ORGANIZATION> F-28 just after it departed from the <LOCATION> Manco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Capac </LOCATION> airport at <LOCATION> Juliaca </LOCATION>, 540 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. In a brief communique the state-operated airline said an American was among the dead and identified him as <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, but listed no hometown. It said other foreigners killed were <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Ervert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ingeborg </PERSON> <PERSON> Psiller </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, but did not provide hometowns. Transportation Minister <PERSON> Camilo </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrillo </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Juliaca </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellina </PERSON>, the pilot of Flight 771, swerved the stricken craft in an effort to return to the runway but it crashed in a pasture. Witnesses said the twin-jet plane broke in two and the rear section burst into flames, and many of the injured suffered burns. Officials said an investigation was underway to determine the cause of the accident. In its list of people who perished, the communique said the bodies of three victims had not been identified and five Peruvians were killed, including an airline hostess. <PERSON> Chirinos </PERSON> said the four dead foreigners were among at least 19 non-Peruvians aboard. He did not have the hometowns of any of the foreigners. He said <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunning </PERSON> and <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Kraus </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Luana </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Gianinazzi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> were hospitalized in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> with grave injuries. The identified the 11 foreigners treated at the <LOCATION> Juliaca </LOCATION> hospital as <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Savoir </PERSON>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Krankin </PERSON>, all with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> passports; <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Koyson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brigitte </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kabin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Joacy </PERSON> <PERSON> Borge </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ana </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gina </PERSON> <PERSON> Garfias </PERSON> all of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. Officials at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said they had no information about the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> victims. The plane was en route from <LOCATION> Juliaca </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Arequipa </LOCATION>, 120 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Juliaca </LOCATION>. Tourists often take the flight to return from visits to <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Titicaca </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Juliaca </LOCATION> Airline and Puno state officials earlier had given different casualty figures, saying as many as 22 people had been killed. Aeroperu president <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerra </PERSON> had said 19 people died. <PERSON> Aeroperu </PERSON> said the plane had a capacity load of 65 passengers and four crew members. Police in <LOCATION> Juliaca </LOCATION> said four Peruvian legislators _ a sentator and three congressmen _ were among the victims. One of the lawmakers, Congressman <PERSON> Rolando </PERSON> <PERSON> Avila </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Juliaca </LOCATION> that the aircraft had traveled only about 400 yards after takeoff when the lights went out and there was an explosion. `` I thought our hour had arrived,'' <PERSON> Avila </PERSON> said. `` Everyone panicked. The pilots apparently tried to level off to land and the plane scraped the roofs of some adobe homes before falling near a small river.'' <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerra </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Aeroperu </ORGANIZATION> president, said the plane crashed one minute after taking off at 10:45 a.m. The airline said that within seconds after takeoff the pilot radioed the Juliaca tower saying the plane was losing altitude, he was returning and asked for emergency crews to stand by. Two months ago the <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeroperu </ORGANIZATION> issued a statment claiming the airline's planes were in bad shape because of shortages of spare parts. <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> is virtually out of foreign currency reserves because of its economic crisis and is unable to import equipment for many of its industries. <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s last major air accident occurred Dec. 9 when a twin-engine <ORGANIZATION> Fokker </ORGANIZATION> F-27 crashed off the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> coast, killing 44 people including most of the members of the <LOCATION> Lianza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> soccer team.

<HEAD>Attorney Says Engineer Recruited By Egyptian Defense Minister</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An attorney for a rocket expert accused in a $ 1 million scheme to smuggle American missile technology to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> said Tuesday that <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> officials claimed the operation had been approved by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Topel </PERSON>, an attorney for <PERSON> Abdelkader </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmy </PERSON>, an Egyptian-born <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen who was a rocket specialist at the <ORGANIZATION> Aerojet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Solid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Propulsion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, said the American government possesses a report from <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> officials making that claim. <PERSON> Topel </PERSON> said he is attempting to obtain the document as part of his defense for <PERSON> Helmy </PERSON>, 40, who is jailed on a no-bail warrant pending a trial expected to begin next spring. <PERSON> Topel </PERSON> said <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> government documents also support his contention that his client was recruited by <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s defense minister, Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Abdel-Halim </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu-Ghazala </PERSON>. In papers filed Monday in federal <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Topel </PERSON> said <PERSON> Helmy </PERSON> met twice with <LOCATION> Abu-Ghazala </LOCATION> _ in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> in September 1987 and in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last March. The papers said the general asked for <PERSON> Helmy </PERSON>'s aid in buying material for an Egyptian military research and development program. <PERSON> Topel </PERSON> identified the program as a joint effort with <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and perhaps other countries to develop medium-range missiles. `` Our investigation has shown these meetings did occur,'' <PERSON> Topel </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` We expect at an appropriate time in trial to provide more than sufficient evidence that the meetings occurred. ... The appropriate time is not now.'' <PERSON> Helmy </PERSON>, his wife and another <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> were charged last June with money laundering and conspiring illegally to export technology for sophisticated weapon systems. Two colonels in the Egyptian army also were accused in the case but claimed diplomatic immunity. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities claim <PERSON> Helmy </PERSON> received $ 1 million in payments from Egyptians for his role involving the illicit export of a substance called carbon-carbon or carbon composite. The material is a low-radar-visibility compound used in missile nose cones and Stealth aircraft. They accuse <PERSON> Helmy </PERSON> of belonging to an international export ring illegally sending sensitive material to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> has said it is cooperating with the investigation, but President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> has said the Egyptian defendants were guilty only of procedural errors and had committed no crimes. Federal prosecutors have declined comment on the defense allegations. They have until Nov. 7 to file a formal response in District Court. A hearing is scheduled for Dec. 1.

 As baseball wrapped up its season, the new television season started taking place, as evidenced by a weekly Nielsens list that sported more entertainment shows and few reruns. The last three games of the five-game World Series joined `` The Cosby Show'' to give <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> the top four spots in the <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> rankings and a substantial victory last week. But everybody got a share of the top 10, with <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> adding its new sitcom `` Roseanne,'' the highest-rated premiere of an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> comedy since `` Joanie Loves Chachi'' 6 -LCB- years ago. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> won the Sunday movie battle and got a top 10 rating from the conclusion of the two-part movie `` Jack the Ripper.'' The final game between the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dodgers </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> A </ORGANIZATION>'s was the week's highest-rated program with a 26.3 rating and 43 share. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> won the week with an average prime-time rating of 18.8 to <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s 13.9 and CBS' 12.7. A rating point equals 904,000 homes with televisions. The share is a percentage of sets in use. The average rating for <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s coverage of the Series was 23.7, one point higher than the first five games of last year's series between <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. The top-rated shows of the week were: `` World Series _ Game 5,'' `` The Cosby Show,'' `` World Series _ Game 3'' and `` World Series _ Game 4,'' all on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>; `` Roseanne'' and `` Who's the Boss?'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>; `` NBC Monday Night Movie _ Double Standard;'' `` 60 Minutes,'' `` CBS Sunday Movie _ Jack the Ripper, Part Two'' and `` Murder, She Wrote,'' CBS. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` World News Tonight'' and the `` CBS Evening News'' tied for first place in the news category with an average 10.2 and 20 share. `` NBC Nightly News,'' pre-empted by baseball, had an 8.9 and 18. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s limited-run remake of `` Mission Impossible'' made its debut at 24th. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s new `` Empty Nest'' was 16th. But `` Something Is Out There,'' based on last season's successful <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> miniseries, ranked only 42nd. The lowest-rated shows of the week were: `` Bugs Bunny: Battle of the Video Stars,'' `` Wiseguy special,'' `` 48 Hours,'' `` Incredible Sunday,'' `` <ORGANIZATION> Smothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION>,'' `` MacGyver,'' `` West 57th,'' `` High Risk,'' `` Live! <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> Present'' and `` <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>.''

<TEXT>
 A mass killer confined to a psychiatric hospital since his 1949 rampage in which he gunned down 13 people can attend music and horticultural therapy sessions in a geriatric unit, a judge has ruled. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Unruh </PERSON>, 67, has been hospitalized since Sept. 7, 1949, the day after he opened fire on motorists and his east <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION> neighbors, dashing through homes and buildings in a murderous rampage. Psychiatrists who have periodically reviewed <PERSON> Unruh </PERSON>'s case found him incompetent to stand trial. Each year, courts have considered <PERSON> Unruh </PERSON>'s hospitalization at <ORGANIZATION> Trenton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. In 1980, <PERSON> Unruh </PERSON>'s attorney sought dismissal of the indictment to permit <PERSON> Unruh </PERSON>'s transfer to a less restrictive facility. Three years later, he was transferred from the Vroom Building for the criminally insane to an intensive treatment unit. In 1986, he was granted walking privileges around the grounds. In documents submitted Monday, defense attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> asked the court to transfer <PERSON> Unruh </PERSON> to a nearby geriatric unit. But during Tuesday's <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> hearing, <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> withdrew his request, asking only that <PERSON> Unruh </PERSON> be permitted to attend the special therapy sessions. Judge I.V. <PERSON> DiMartino </PERSON> granted the request. <PERSON> Unruh </PERSON> attended the hearing, appearing to be more alert than in past court visits. He receives medication to keep his schizophrenia under control, said his psychiatrist, Dr. <PERSON> Manolo </PERSON> <PERSON> Mempin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mempin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Unruh </PERSON> is the oldest patient in the unit, which houses 29 people, most in their 20s and 30s. <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Holland </PERSON>, program coordinator in the geriatric unit, suggested that the violent nature of other patients in the intensive treatment unit could endanger <PERSON> Unruh </PERSON>. `` He's out of place,'' she said. `` The patients are all very young and aggressive.'' <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Wixted </PERSON>, first assistant prosecutor in <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, opposed any change in <PERSON> Unruh </PERSON>'s hospitalization. He called the staff at the psychiatric hospital `` well-meaning, well-intentioned therapists who are firmly committed to the belief that no one is beyond help.'' `` Some demon went into <PERSON> Unruh </PERSON>'s head and locked his mind at a point where it can no longer be reached,'' <PERSON> Wixted </PERSON> said. `` We're faced with that reality.

 The genteel world of British publishing is awakening to the age of the conglomerate and wrestling with the question of whether books can be sold like bars of soap. `` Publishing has become a pitiless world, the stuff of boardroom battles and heart-rending drama. No place for gentlemen,'' writes <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Pringle </PERSON> in The Independent newspaper. `` Publishing was very much a cottage industry here. It's now a business,'' says <PERSON> Joanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldsworthy </PERSON>, a publishing director at prestigious <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Gollancz </PERSON>. `` Business people forget that without authors, they're nothing.'' Such comments have sparked a heated debate about the place of corporations, especially American ones, in British publishing, where dreamy images of a gaslighted Dickensian era linger. The big guns deny they are cheapening literature, and few top authors are complaining about the vastly fatter advances being offered. `` You can find a Dickensian publisher, -LRB- but -RRB- no one wants to,'' observes London-based American agent <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Victor </PERSON>. `` It's no good looking back and being wistful. The old days are gone. You're not going to go out and buy a Remington typewriter when you can buy a word processor.'' The trend toward conglomerates has encouraged some small quality imprints to take wing, rather as a neighborhood supermarket will spawn high-quality delicatessens around it. `` Were the good old days really all that good?'' said <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Collins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishers </ORGANIZATION>, one of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s most acquisitive houses. `` Conditions of employment, wages, and salaries were appalling,'' he said at a recent publishers' seminar. `` Since the mid -'70s, we've had to look to our laurels and become much more We're having to recognize that books should make a return on investment ... -LRB- but -RRB- they can still have the same love and care,'' he said. There's no shortage of books. In 1987, 59,837 titles were published in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, compared to 36,322 a decade before. But the increase is in output rather than quality _ hobby and special interest books rather than in exciting new fiction. Meanwhile, the gentleman publisher is becoming a thing of the past. In February 1986, <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> bought the small British house of <LOCATION> Sidgwick </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> for 1.75 million pounds -LRB- about $ 2.5 million -RRB-. One year later, <ORGANIZATION> Random </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bought the publishing consortium <ORGANIZATION> CVBC </ORGANIZATION> for 17.5 million pounds -LRB- about $ 31 million -RRB-. That purchase ended the independence of four noted British imprints _ <PERSON> Chatto </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Windus </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Virago </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bodley </PERSON> <PERSON> Head </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cape </PERSON> _ and gave <ORGANIZATION> Random </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> a long-sought British foothold. <PERSON> Virago </PERSON>, which specializes in feminist literature, bought its way out six months later and is now 90-percent independent. Takeover fever is not exclusively American. Over the past four years, British-owned Octopus has purchased <LOCATION> Methuen </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Secker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Warburg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Heinemann </PERSON>, three <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> houses esteemed for their independence and the attention they lavished on their authors. British publisher <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> has bid unsuccessfully for <ORGANIZATION> Harcourt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brace </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Jovanovich </PERSON> and is now trying to buy <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The two <ORGANIZATION> Macmillans </ORGANIZATION> have common ancestry but are now separate companies. Meanwhile, the prices paid for books have skyrocketed. <PERSON> Chatto </PERSON> and <PERSON> Windus </PERSON> bought <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Holroyd </PERSON>'s three-volume biography of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> for 625,000 pounds -LRB- about $ 1 million -RRB-. Novelist <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> left <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cape </PERSON> for Viking Penguin and a two-book deal reported at 850,000 pounds -LRB- about $ 1.43 million -RRB-. Penguin, a pioneer of British paperbacks, has also become an important publishing outlet in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Bookshops reflect the changing status in the business. Sleek chain stores with shopping carts and glaring lights are supplanting those quiet, musty, idiosyncratic establishments of `` 84 <LOCATION> Charing </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cross </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION>,'' where one could browse and lose oneself for an entire day. If literature now represents lucre, some are wondering at what price. `` Authors at the moment are getting rather a raw deal,'' said <PERSON> Gollancz </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Goldsworthy </PERSON>. `` Publishing is becoming so much more of a business ... -LRB- that -RRB- publishers are forgetting at their peril that they need authors.'' Novelist <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradbury </PERSON> agreed that practices had changed since his first novel, `` Eating People Is Wrong,'' appeared in 1959. `` I'm worried,'' the author said in an interview. `` These changes in ownership may result in remote companies whose prime interest is not in publishing, but in publishing balance sheets. `` The danger will be if we reach a point where commercial pressures become so intense that publishers can only afford to go with books that can sell in very large quantities.'' Octopus' purchase of <PERSON> Secker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Warburg </PERSON>, the imprint that gave <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Orwell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> and <PERSON> Italo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calvino </PERSON>, prompted an anguished open letter from literary agent <PERSON> Giles </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> to Punch Magazine. `` Most of our significant literary houses are now shackled and restricted in the hands of managers, bureaucracies, corporate strategies,'' <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> wrote. `` Your shareholders may be pleased. We readers are appalled. ... I beseech you, think it possible you may be mistaken.'' Calls to Octopus for comment were not returned. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Burgess </PERSON>, author of `` A Clockwork Orange,'' argued in The Observer that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had set the precedent, and he saw a dilemma for authors. `` The impersonality of the whole proceeding is mitigated, for the author, by money. But money, strangely enough, can not easily compensate for the author's sense of being reduced to a commodity like soap or peanut butter,'' he wrote. <PERSON> Bradbury </PERSON> said that whatever the problems, the changes have advantages. `` The greater commercialization in the system has improved book-selling no end,'' he said. `` More books are bought, and newish writers are acquiring audiences through this distribution system at a far greater speed than they would have done when I started writing.'' Meanwhile, bucking the prevailing trend are a few new publishing houses seeking to fill the void created by the takeovers. In September 1986, <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> launched <ORGANIZATION> Bloomsbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> with 2 million pounds -LRB- then about $ 3 million -RRB- in capital, saying the surge in conglomerates spurred him on. <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bloomsbury </PERSON> offered authors a tailor-made service increasingly unavailable elsewhere. Its fiction list includes both acclaimed newcomers such as <PERSON> Jeanette </PERSON> <PERSON> Winterson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON>, and such veterans as <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>. One of its first commercial coups was the purchase of British rights to `` Presumed Innocent,'' <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> novelist <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Turow </PERSON>'s best seller But might Bloomsbury itself be taken over? `` No, it wo n't,'' said <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>. `` We've received offers, but are committed to autonomy.''

 The U.S.-Canada free trade agreement negotiated by Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> dominated the debate Tuesday among leaders of the three major parties in a critical prelude to the Nov. 21 election. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> said the agreement achieved by his <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was central to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s future and he described his rivals' attacks against the pact as `` scare mongering.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Broadbent </PERSON> of the socialist <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> criticized <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> and then argued about who had most effectively opposed the agreement. The three-hour, English-language debate was broadcast nationally from <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> and followed a three-hour French-language debate Monday night. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> said the agreement, scheduled to take effect Jan. 1, will allow <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> to move ahead and compete internationally to assure future prosperity. He challenged his foes to outline an effective alternative. `` They would tear up the free trade agreement and then what? They offer you nothing but the poverty of protectionism,'' he said. Turner again vowed to battle the pact. `` This election is not a popularity contest. The issue is the future of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> -RRB- now wants to turn us into a pale replica of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' Polls early in the campaign that began Oct. 1 generally placed the Conservatives first, with at least 40 percent of the vote usually needed for a majority government. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> called the election Oct. 1 after serving four years of his maximum five-year term. He won a landslide victory in 1984 and is seeking to put together a second consecutive majority government, which has not happened in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> since 1953. The New Democrats pushed the Liberals to third in most polls before the debates. That would be a stunning setback for the party of former Prime Minister <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Trudeau </PERSON>. <PERSON> Broadbent </PERSON> also strongly attacked the free trade agreement. `` This deal must be stopped because it takes away our right to make decisions about our own country in our own way,'' he said. Critics of the trade pact say the huge population and economic power of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would force <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> to renounce social welfare programs and regional development plans. `` What we have here is a deal that touches virtually every aspect of Canadian life,'' <PERSON> Broadbent </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said, `` I hope Canadians defeat this deal by defeating Mr. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> responded by saying Canadians are fully capable of competing internationally and there was `` not the slightest justification'' for raising fears of loss of identity or social protections. `` You've been scare mongering,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted, 83-9, in September in favor of the trade agreement signed in January by <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, however, only the elected House of Commons controlled by the Conservatives passed it. Liberals in the non-elected <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> balked and kept the agreement bottled up. A <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> win with a parliamentary majority would let the world's two largest trading partners proceed to form a North American free trade zone on Jan. 1, eliminating all tariffs over a 10-year period and dismantling barriers to investment and competition. A Gallup poll published Tuesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Toronto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> found support for the agreement slippng, with 42 percent of Canadians opposed and 34 percent in favor. The others said they had no opinion or neither supported nor opposed the proposal.

 Journalist <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> says he is steeling himself for the day when someone says to him at a cocktail party: `` Oh, so you're in Fleet Street, are you? Banking or insurance?'' For <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, editor-in-chief of <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the domestic British news agency, this ignominy may be close at hand. As one newspaper after another flees Fleet Street for modern plants elsewhere, banks and other financial institutions are moving in along the thoroughfare and the narrow lanes wending south to the <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Thames </LOCATION> and north to <LOCATION> Holborn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>. The short, crowded street and adjoining warren of crooked alleys and hidden courtyards, the haunt of <PERSON> Dickens </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pepys </PERSON> and Dr. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, was once synonymous with the newspaper industry _ noisy, grubby and exuberant. `` The man must have a rare recipe for melancholy, who can be dull in Fleet Street,'' observed the Victorian essayist <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamb </PERSON>. Now, as the capital's fulcrum moves east to the <LOCATION> Docklands </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s biggest urban renewal program, Fleet Street is gradually being absorbed into the neighboring <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s financial district. The shells of the newspaper buildings remain, largely because the entire street has been designated a conservation area to retain its Dickensian character. Behind the facades, however, the presses and newsrooms are being ripped out and replaced with trading floors and computers. Instead of printers and reporters rushing to meet deadlines, the street is full of construction workers and lawyers, stockbrokers and dealmakers. Property values and rents have soared as the conglomerates created by <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s blossoming financial markets compete for office space on the old `` street of ink.'' The first newspaper to capitalize on the property boom was the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Evening Standard. Its former home on Shoe Lane was torn down to make way for the head offices of accountants <ORGANIZATION> Coopers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lybrand </ORGANIZATION>. In 1984, the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> sold its 1.15 acre site at 135 Fleet Street, complete with art deco lobby and penthouse lawn and garden. It is being developed into the European headquarters of <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION>, the American investment banking firm. News International, which publishes the Sun and News of the World tabloids, will turn its Bouverie Street site into an office development. The Financial Times' Bracken House headquarters went to the Japanese construction firm <LOCATION> Ohbayashiin </LOCATION> in June 1986 for about $ 230 million. The <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>, whose black-facaded building still frowns imposingly over Fleet Street, also is moving out. Only <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, publishers of the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION>, the Sunday Mirror and the Sunday People, has not yet announced plans to leave. Keeping <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> company are the news agencies _ The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, directly behind the Mirror Building, and <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION>, which shares the <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> building. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Saint </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Historic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Buildings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monuments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said the newspaper industry is the last major one to move out. Fleet Street proper begins at <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION>, an ancient boundary marker for the City of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, and until the 18th century the spot where the severed heads of traitors were displayed. Named after the nearby Fleet River that now runs underground, it was one of medieval <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s main east-west routes for travel between the government at <LOCATION> Westminster </LOCATION> and commerce in the City. To this day, whenever the monarch makes a state visit to the City, she pauses at <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> for a ceremony with the Lord Mayor. The first recorded printer, <PERSON> Wynkyn </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Worde </PERSON>, arrived about 1500 and set up shop near Shoe Lane where bookbinders worked. The first newspaper, The Daily Courant, arrived in 1702. Before that, Fleet Street had been a showplace for freaks, fire-eaters and wild animals. Diarist <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepys </PERSON> reputedly was born in <LOCATION> Salisbury </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION>, just off Fleet Street, in 1633. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, the great writer and lexicographer, lived and worked in the area in the mid-18th century, and his house in <LOCATION> Gough </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> is a museum. Fleet Street also is home to the <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>, one of four sets of offices and apartments for senior lawyers known as the Inns of the Court. Above its entrance at No. 17 Fleet Street the partly timbered building is one of the few domestic buildings in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to survive from <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s time. For centuries, journalists have worshipped at <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Wren </PERSON>'s splendid St. Bride's church at the foot of the street <PERSON> Pepys </PERSON> was baptized in the church, and the parents of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Dare, the first English child born in colonial <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, were married here. So were the parents of <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Winslow </PERSON>, a leader of the Pilgrim Fathers. Lightning knocked eight feet off <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bride </LOCATION>'s steeple in 1764, and among those King <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> called in to advise him on repairs was <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>. The church was gutted by World War II bombs and rebuilt with donations from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> newspapers. Although some newspapers have moved to new, high-tech premises, `` Fleet Street'' is still used to describe <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s national press. `` I do n't think one will have ` off-Fleet Street,' like you have Broadway, off-Broadway,'' <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> said. Certain other things never change. Ye <ORGANIZATION> Olde </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cheshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cheese </ORGANIZATION>, the pub and restaurant with sawdust covered floors, rebuilt in 1667 after the great fire of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and later frequented by Dr. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s crowd, still sells a traditional roast beef and <ORGANIZATION> Yorkshire </ORGANIZATION> pudding dinner for about $ 8.75. And at <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vino </LOCATION>'s, men still must wear ties and women are not served at the bar.

<TEXT>
 Emerging from what a senior commander calls a `` do-it-yourself war'' in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is absorbing and, in some cases, already applying lessons learned in a year of unrelenting tension and sudden bursts of combat. Although not a direct participant in the war between <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> sent warships to ensure freedom of shipping in the gulf. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> found itself committed to its biggest, costliest mission since <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and by some measures since World War I. Between July 24, 1987 _ when the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> supertanker <LOCATION> Bridgeton </LOCATION> struck a mine while under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> escort _ and the Iraq-Iran cease-fire on Aug. 20, 1988, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships and aircraft engaged in more than a dozen armed clashes with Iranian forces and encounters with <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> warplanes. Officers say the gulf experience, which included the first combat use of many computer and weapons systems, could lead to many changes in operating procedures, shipboard equipment and even a revived emphasis on survivability in warship design. It also is prompting a serious look at more subtle questions such as stress. Sailors in the gulf were living under a constant state of high alert and performing the technical tasks of missile warfare. Officers often had only seconds to make major decisions. Official concern about stress was given special impetus by the July 3 disaster in which the missile cruiser USS Vincennes mistook an Iranian jetliner for a military attack plane and shot it down, killing all 290 aboard. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investigators said the pressure of first-time combat caused <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> radar operators to misinterpret crucial computer data, and recommended that stress and the `` human factor'' be studied for future training purposes. Although investigators said the ship's `` Aegis'' radar-weapons system worked as intended, the system is being modified to feed more precise information on aircraft threats. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> also has made or is planning changes in shipboard emergency procedures, damage control and fire-fighting methods as a result of the near-sinking of the missile frigates USS Stark and USS <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>. Thirty-seven crewmen were killed on the Stark when it was hit by two <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> missiles on May 17, 1987, and 10 <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>' crewmen were hurt when it was almost ripped in half by an Iranian mine last April 14. The gulf inspired the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s first use of computer systems to train officers and crews for a specific combat zone. The computers simulated gulf geography and tactical situations, with tapes of actual radio traffic for added realism. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had kept a small flotilla in the gulf since 1949 but it quadrupled after President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> agreed in mid-1987 to reflag and escort <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> oil tankers menaced by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which considered <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> an <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> ally. The buildup ultimately reached more than 30 warships in the region, spurring similar moves by five West European governments. Gen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crist </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> and architect of the operation, said the 600-mile-long gulf, crowded with ships, oil rigs and besieged by warring neighbors, was a `` learning experience'' for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, whose strategies are built on long-range ocean warfare. `` It was a real do-it-yourself, come-as-you-are operation,'' said <PERSON> Crist </PERSON>, whose Florida-based command controls <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military activities in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. `` There were no books, no doctrine.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, for example, had not run an ocean convoy since World War II, and the only officers trained for the task were civilian reservists. Teachers, accountants and merchant mariners were recalled to active duty as liaison officers aboard the Kuwaiti tankers. Improvising for `` guerrilla warfare at sea,'' <PERSON> Crist </PERSON> hired tugboats as temporary mine sweepers and leased two huge barges as floating combat bases after <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states rejected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pleas to use their territory. He said the barges, an idea borrowed from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> where American forces patrolled from bases in enemy-held areas, showed it was possible to range far afield `` without a tremendous base infrastructure ... and still project our power.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officers say the `` mobile sea bases'' were instrumental in discouraging Iranian shipping raids in the northern gulf for seven months before the cease-fire. Their secret, night-flying Army helicopters also caught an Iranian minelayer, proving that <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> was mining gulf sea lanes. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships, built to fight submarines and aircraft, were ill-equipped to combat <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s armed speedboats and Chinese-made Silkworm missiles, considered the main threats to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> convoys. Gulf-bound warships soon were being fitted with new firepower _ machine guns, a laser-sighted Army tank cannon, and the radar-guided <PERSON> Phalanx </PERSON> <PERSON> Gatling </PERSON> gun that hurls a storm of shells at incoming missiles. Even before the July 3 <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> tragedy, some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officers had criticized the choice of the billion-dollar <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> as being too much ship for the gulf. Aides say, however, that <PERSON> Crist </PERSON> stands by the decision, which was aimed at countering an Iranian missile threat. Some other ideas fizzled or never got started. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> helicopter mine sweepers toiled six months in the gulf's grueling heat and dust without finding a mine Vietnam-era river patrol boats proved useless. Officials twice considered and abandoned the idea of calling in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. Five dolphins trained in a top-secret <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> project to guard against underwater sabotage were sent to the gulf, but returned home after one died from a virus. <PERSON> Crist </PERSON> said one of his biggest problems was a command structure in which the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s gulf commander answered to him, while some carrier groups in the <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> remained under <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> fleet jurisdiction. To solve the command split, <PERSON> Crist </PERSON> created a unified Joint Task Force <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, directly under his headquarters. He said that decision could serve as a model for avoiding future interservice rivalries in time of crisis. `` If you look at it, this low intensity -LRB- warfare -RRB- is probably where we're going to be for a long time, and commanders have to be able to ` think joint,' worry about the best the services can make available, not the parochialism,'' <PERSON> Crist </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Ungaro Summer Offerings Mostly A Variation Of Last Year</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Wednesday AMs report.</NOTE>

 Summer sirens in sizzling colors and clinging short skirts ambled down the runway at <ORGANIZATION> Emanuel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ungaro </ORGANIZATION>'s summer ready-to-wear show. While the rest of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> is easing up on summer profiles with many dropped hemlines, <PERSON> Ungaro </PERSON> went his own way _ fitting, draping and adding little bows to sexy outfits. Most of the dozens of looks in Tuesday's long and somewhat monotonous show were variations on last year's. There were countless gorgeous but familiar nipped-waist spencer jackets with long points, plus plenty of peplums above the body-hugging skirts. The newer flowing babydoll jackets in hot colors are easier toppers. Varied fabrics were mixed in an outfit, another Ungaro forte. His new short skirt is shiny red, burgundy or brown patent leather, teamed up with flowered blouses and jackets. <PERSON> Ungaro </PERSON>'s flower garden sprouted all kinds of posies, in every spring color imaginable from pink to robin's egg blue to lime, fuchsia and amethyst. The decorator's dream prints were heavily charged with big peonies and roses, but the best flower jackets were simpler _ white pique sprigged with wild flowers. <PERSON> Ungaro </PERSON>'s pants are original. Instead of the favorite wide pantskirt, he chose droopy drawers, long or short fluid harem or bloomer pants, teamed up with the showy, flowered fitted tops. Evening wear with plenty of lace and lame was predictably flounced and elaborate looking, as most of the show did, a dead-ringer for couture. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Douvier </PERSON>'s styles for <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Laroche </PERSON> were much simpler and undoubtedly will be less expensive. This clean-cut collection featured short skirts, smart pea jackets and long, straight pants or shorts in red, white and navy nautical lines. Careful cut and finish gave blue or gray denim skirts and shorts suits smooth city elegance. Big color prints burst out here, too, on flowered strapless bustier sheaths with puff-sleeved boleros. Other feminine lines in turquoise, fuchsia and yellow were paneled and wrapped like flower petals. And with all this color, <PERSON> Douvier </PERSON> was dotty over black polka dots on the hot colors. <PERSON> Jean-Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Scherrer </PERSON> showed a huge group of navy-and-white nautical outfits, beautifully cut with flowing trousers, and neat variations on the pea jacket, as well as lots of stripes. <PERSON> Scherrer </PERSON> showed full shorts and a striped mini-jersey, but he usually preferred less leggy looks. A white pique sundress with a long, swirling skirt and little blue jacket could be a winner. There were enough safari outfits and jungle prints here to make a planter pleased as punch. In desert shades of sand and burnt orange, or printed in green and violet, they ranged from sexy tulip-draped skirts to belted but full light cotton bush jackets over ample long pants. For after-hours, <PERSON> Scherrer </PERSON> opted for flowered, draped sheaths or lacy inspiration in short or long evening dresses of expensive lingerie inspiration. The froths of lace bubbled all over like champagne, including the soft peach and sky blue dressy evening pyjamas, and bustier dresses with silk chiffon blazers. <PERSON> Scherrer </PERSON> ended the show with navy lame and lurex sailor suits, quite handsome indeed for the skipper or first mate on the night watch. <PERSON> Valentino </PERSON> also was big on lace. But he did n't seem to know where to stop, pairing it with chiffon prints and huge swaths of rhinestone embroidery. On some outfits it looked demure; on others, it was rather heavy-handed. Day wear was more successful, especially the suits _ lean, short and sleek as only <PERSON> Valentino </PERSON> knows how to make them. He showed very pure lines in battle-jacket tops, or easily fitted glen plaid or checked jackets over white pique vests, silk blouses underneath. <PERSON> Valentino </PERSON>'s favorite trouser line still looked new, straight and not too full, with a cuff at the ankle. Other trousers included short, full culottes, lean pedal pushers _ topped by boxy plaid jackets. <PERSON> Erik </PERSON> <PERSON> Mortensen </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Balmain </LOCATION> was applauded for a collection that looked both simple and elegant. His idea of the trapeze pants was a suit in awning stripes of red or green, topped with a neat little bolero. Suits were lean, dressy and short, sometimes cut in diagonal, two-colored combinations. And <PERSON> Mortensen </PERSON>'s clinging ribbed knit dresses in hot shades of red, orange and yellow were intriguingly textured with panels of the ribbed knit cut so the ribbing was placed at several angles all over the dress.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Adrian </PERSON> <PERSON> LeCornu </PERSON> leaned against the stump of a 400-year-old spruce and surveyed the remains of the ancient forest on a hill near his Indian village. Where trees 6 feet in diameter once towered over the mossy forest floor, acres of stumps and rotten wood now litter the scarred earth. `` They say war is hell,'' said <PERSON> LeCornu </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hydaburg </PERSON>'s city administrator. `` Well, logging is not a pretty sight, either.'' Timber-cutting is nothing new here. A 700-mile web of logging roads connects this Haida Indian village to the rest of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s Prince of <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> But <PERSON> LeCornu </PERSON> and others who depend on the region's dark forests and cool waters for subsistence hunting and fishing find it ironic that the region's most aggressive and destructive logging is being done by the natives themselves. What is worse, <PERSON> LeCornu </PERSON> said, is that it may be too late to do anything about it. National environmental groups have been crying foul for years over logging in the old-growth spruce and hemlock forests of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s 16 million-acre <ORGANIZATION> Tongass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, several islands to the north of Prince of <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>. But little is heard about native logging, even though cutting on native land in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s panhandle has outstripped the Tongass harvest in each of the last two years. This year, an estimated 15,000 acres of native lands will be cut, compared to about 9,000 acres in the Tongass. Leaders of the native corporations say the logging has boosted the region's economy and caused little environmental damage _ claims disputed by other natives who say the logging provides temporary profit and long-term harm. Commercial fishermen, environmentalists and state wildlife biologists also voice concerns but say little can be done to control native logging. The federal regulations that govern cutting in the Tongass do not apply to native corporations, the panhandle's major private landowners. Clearcutting, which fells all trees in an area, is the norm here. But Tongass clearcuts are limited to 100 acres, while cuts on native lands may stretch across thousands. In addition, native loggers are not required to leave buffer strips of trees along salmon streams or to consider the effects of logging on wildlife habitat. They may also cut on steeper slopes, increasing the chance for stream-clogging silt and landslides, said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON>, a biologist for the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION> and Game. `` We've got a new kind of logging,'' <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON> said. `` A lot of the long-term effects are not fully known. We have concerns, but we do n't have the authority to change it.'' The stage was set for native logging with passage of the 1971 <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> Native Claims Settlement Act, which awarded natives 44 million acres and nearly $ 1 billion to be managed by 12 regional corporations and 200 village corporations. Logging began eight years ago as southeastern <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s one regional corporation and 12 village corporations started receiving the 470,000 acres promised them in the act. Even corporate leaders were surprised at how fast the trees fell. When the timber export market declined sharply in 1981, some corporations had to log heavily to pay off start-up loans. When timber prices rose in 1986, logging intensified as corporations converted assets to cash. Perhaps the strongest incentive to keep cutting down trees was the 1986 Tax Reform Act, under which native corporations could sell their operating losses to profitable corporations in need of tax write-offs. The results of accelerated logging are plain to see. Twenty miles south of <LOCATION> Hydaburg </LOCATION>, a 30,000-acre island is being shaved of old-growth timber. Near the <LOCATION> Chichagof </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Hoonah </LOCATION>, hillsides `` look like they've been nuked,'' according to <PERSON> Ernestine </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON>. The angry villager said logging had destroyed her favorite spot for collecting the spruce roots she weaves into baskets. The rush to cut has overwhelmed <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON> and other state inspectors, who enforce the state's Forest Practices Act and try to protect salmon streams. This summer, in one of the most serious violations, <ORGANIZATION> Klukwan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> was fined $ 7,500 and ordered to restore a 500-foot stretch of a salmon stream it had buried under tons of logs, branches and organic debris. Besides noting the potential damage to salmon runs by such careless logging practices, environmentalists also say clearcuts _ and the young, same-height forests that follow _ threaten <LOCATION> Sitka </LOCATION> black-tailed deer, which depend on old trees for protection from deep snow. But the environmentalists have not pressed their concerns, concentrating instead on the <ORGANIZATION> Tongass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. `` You have to pick your fights,'' said <PERSON> Bart </PERSON> <PERSON> Koehler </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. `` There is a better chance of changing things on public lands than on native lands.'' That's as it should be, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, a vice president for <ORGANIZATION> Sealaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the regional native corporation and southeastern <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s biggest private landowner. Private land should not be subject to the same constraints as public land, he said. Like any corporation, <ORGANIZATION> Sealaska </ORGANIZATION> has a responsibility to its shareholders to maximize profits, he said. Not surprisingly, attitudes toward logging in native villages depend at least partly on how much the villages have gained from logging. Complaints are few in the Prince of <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Kasaan </LOCATION>, whose corporation sold its timber rights, invested the money and now pays an annual $ 10,000 dividend to each of its 119 shareholders. In <LOCATION> Hydaburg </LOCATION>, the rewards have been smaller, and the opposition to logging has been greater. When land was being handed out, the village's <ORGANIZATION> Haida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> received mostly scrub timber and is just now struggling out of bankruptcy court. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Sealaska </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Klukwan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a village corporation based 300 miles to the north, are heavily cutting more productive lands near <LOCATION> Hydaburg </LOCATION>. When <ORGANIZATION> Sealaska </ORGANIZATION> sought to cut trees above <LOCATION> Hydaburg </LOCATION>'s reservoir, the city council forced one delay after another, worried that logging would silt up streams and foul its water supply. <ORGANIZATION> Sealaska </ORGANIZATION> had planned to cut up to 700 acres in the watershed. It stopped in May 1987, after cutting only 100 acres. `` Sealaska probably will never touch the watershed again _ too much trouble,'' said <PERSON> Hydaburg </PERSON> Mayor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanderson </PERSON>. Recent efforts to regulate native logging have concentrated on putting more teeth in the state's Forest Practices Act. This summer, Gov. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> appointed a panel to review the law. But any changes will come too late to affect most native land. Several village corporations have exhausted their commercial timber stands, and the others are expected to run out of trees within three years. <ORGANIZATION> Sealaska </ORGANIZATION> can log for eight to 10 more years. The forest will take 100 years to grow back to commercial size, at least 300 years to become the old-growth forest that environmentalists are now trying to protect. `` How do you manage the land now?'' asked Mayor <PERSON> Sanderson </PERSON>. `` It's already stripped All you can do now is let the trees grow back.''

<HEAD>Prosecutors Ridicule North's Defense That Lies Were OK</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> offers a `` shocking and cynical'' view of democracy by arguing that his lies to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> were n't crimes because other high officials deliberately misled lawmakers, Iran-Contra prosecutors say Responding to <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s motions to dismiss charges he lied about his covert assistance of Nicaraguan rebels, prosecutors said the former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide's arguments are `` incompatible with the aspirations of our system of government'' and `` inconsistent with any but the most jaundiced view of the realities of politics and government.'' The spirited attack on <PERSON> North </PERSON> was offered Monday by independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, who consented to a defense motion to dismiss a charge that the former <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> officer and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide obstructed an investigation of who paid for a $ 13,800 security fence outside his house. Lawyers for the retired <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant colonel said any alleged fabrication of documents in December 1986 to conceal payments for the fence by arms dealer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> was n't obstruction of justice because the Iran-Contra grand jury did not begin its work for another month While conceding a legal deficiency in one of 16 charges against <PERSON> North </PERSON>, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s office urged the court to reject a series of defense motions to dismiss other counts of the indictment. Prosecutors disclosed new details about <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s destruction of key <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> documents in November 1986 as the Iran-Contra affair was unraveling. North destroyed original copies of so-called `` System IV'' documents at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> that prosecutors called `` the most sensitive records in the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION>'s carefully constructed system of document control.'' There is also evidence he purposely withheld from <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> files original copies of documents that were the `` sole record of the events and activities described therein,'' prosecutors said. They also ridiculed <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s defense that he was not warned that lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in unsworn statements could result in criminal prosecution. The defense had claimed that <PERSON> North </PERSON> was the first government official to be prosecuted for alleged falsehoods in unsworn statements to lawmakers. North's lawyers recounted a history of lies to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by top government officials, including Secretary of State <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> <PERSON> Dulles </PERSON>' false denial of <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> involvement in a 1958 plot to overthrow <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Sukarno </PERSON>. Prosecutors said such a rebuttal `` reflects a shocking and cynical view of the relations between the people's elected representatives in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and officials of the executive branch.'' North's defense, in effect, is an argument that `` lying is so ingrained and pervasive a practice in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that _ despite laws clearly making it a crime for ordinary non-office-holding citizens to make false statements to government agencies _ executive officers lack fair notice that there is not an implicit exception putting them above such laws,'' prosecutors said in papers filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Among the charges against <PERSON> North </PERSON> is that he drafted false letters in 1985 to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Permanent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> and a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee. North also is charged with making similarly false statements during a 1986 briefing to members of the intelligence committee. The three 1985 letters, which were signed by then-national security advisor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, falsely stated that <PERSON> North </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> officers were not involved in any covert efforts to raise money to arm the Contras. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> has pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of withholding information from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about covert Contra aid by sending the letters and in testimony in 1986. The congressional queries were made following news reports linking <PERSON> North </PERSON> to covert assistance to the Contras at a time such aid was banned by the Boland Amendment. `` North responded with calculated falsehood, intending to derail further investigation and generally succeeding,'' prosecutors said of charges that the former <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> aide drafted letters that falsely denied his involvement in covert aid and fund-raising. `` North could foresee that, when the committees received false denials and explanations which he intended to offer them, their predictable responses would be to cease further inquiries in this area,'' prosecutors said. `` North himself was enabled to continue his secret support of the Contras, which culminated in the illegal corruption of the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> initiative,'' prosecutors said, referring to charges that <PERSON> North </PERSON> conspired to illegally divert U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to the Contras. Prosecutors dismissed <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s argument that the diversion was not illegal on the ground that the government weapons had become the property of <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and his former partner, <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>, when they were sold to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, a co-defendant along with <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> and former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, was a `` sham middleman,'' in a `` classic fraud,'' prosecutors said. Separate trials have been ordered for each defendant. No date has been set for North's trial to begin.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government is preparing to buy into small, private businesses in some Third World countries as part of an effort to boost <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports. The $ 10 million to be invested by the <ORGANIZATION> Overseas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> OPIC </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- was authorized in a little-noticed bill signed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to extend the agency's life and give it some new roles. `` A vital key to increasing our efforts, righting the -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- trade deficit and creating new domestic job opportunities will be the rate at which we gain footholds in the developing countries by establishing a physical presence through direct investment,'' <ORGANIZATION> OPIC </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nalen </PERSON> said in a statement Monday. <ORGANIZATION> OPIC </ORGANIZATION>'s main role is to insure <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry abroad against the risk of hostile action by other governments, with the aim of encouraging American business to invest in the Third World. It is one of the few government agencies to operate at a profit. `` The legislation will permit the corporation to take an equity position in small-scale projects in sub-Saharan <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Nalen </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hornberg </PERSON>, in charge of <ORGANIZATION> OPIC </ORGANIZATION>'s contacts with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said the investments can help fledgling businesses by buying some of their stock and lending money to their owners. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government will be allowed to buy no more than 30 percent of the stock in any company. `` When the sponsor of a new business ca n't raise enough money to get started, it may be too much of an interest burden for a new company to borrow it all,'' he said. `` The new law enables the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government to supply some of the capital as an investment, with the expectation that in 10 years or so, it can sell its shares and get out,'' <PERSON> Hornberg </PERSON> said. The program is authorized for four years and <PERSON> Hornberg </PERSON> said he hoped it would be renewed if successful. There is no list of specific countries where the government will be permitted to invest, but it will be limited to those where <ORGANIZATION> OPIC </ORGANIZATION> already operates, he said. That would eliminate <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.

 Interest rates on short-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> securities were mixed in the latest auction. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sold $ 7.0 billion in three-month bills Monday at an average discount rate of 7.45 percent, up from 7.36 percent last week. Another $ 7.0 billion was sold in six-month bills at an average discount rate of 7.54 percent, down from 7.55 percent last week. The three-month rate was the highest since the bills sold for 7.69 percent on May 13, 1985. The six-month rate was the lowest since the bills averaged 7.46 on Oct. 11. The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors _ 7.70 percent for three-month bills with a $ 10,000 bill selling for $ 9,811.70 and 7.95 percent for six-month bills selling for $ 9,618.80. In a separate report, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said the average yield for one-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills, the most popular index for making changes in adjustable rate home mortgages, rose to 8.12 percent last week after averaging 8.07 percent the week before.

<HEAD>Administration Planning Currency Talks With Taiwan, South Korea</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is preparing for a new round of talks with <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> about what it considers unfair efforts to bolster their trade balances by manipulating the value of their currencies. The omnibus trade bill passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> this summer required the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to determine if four newly industrialized <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> countries _ <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> _ are artificially holding down value of their currencies relative to the dollar. The report, delivered to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> banking committees on Monday, found that <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, while running large trade surpluses, impose few restrictions on trade. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, however, keep their currencies artificially low and impose tariffs and other barriers to free trade, the report said. The failure of the <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> dollar and Korean won to appreciate significantly against the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar keeps prices of American exports to those countries high and the price of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imports of Taiwanese and South Korean products low. A senior <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, noted that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has discussed the exchange rate issue with <LOCATION> Tawian </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> before, but said the trade bill represented `` a very significant change in terms of perception.'' Although it does not specify penalties against countries manipulating their currencies, the bill requires the administration to assess the result of the negotiations in six months. `` If there's a lack of progress, we will have to report that,'' the official said. The new talks will begin `` as soon as we can effectively commence the dialogue,'' he said. In general, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it was pleased by the progress of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its economic allies in stabilizing exchange rates since the Louvre Accord in February 1987. Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and economists have expressed alarm at the 14 percent rise, at an annual rate, in the value of the dollar from lows nine months ago, saying it will hamper progress on whittling down the trade deficit. However, the report said the dollar, by rising this year, had simply rebounded from a drop it characterized as a temporary overreaction to the October stock market crash and that the dollar was still lower than before the crash. `` It seems unlikely that movements in the dollar so far this year will significantly alter the outlook for sustained trade ... improvement,'' it said. The report strongly endorsed efforts by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, which had the largest trade surplus with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, to stimulate its economy in an effort to increase import buying. It said <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which had the second largest trade surplus with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, has also moved in the right direction, but said, `` its performance is less striking.'' Overall, the official predicted the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> current account, which includes trade in merchandise and the flow of investment dollars across borders, will shrink by $ 20 billion this year, from a peak in 1987 of $ 154 billion. The official said the improvement should continue next year, but declined to say by how much. Many private economists maintain the deficit will not shrink further without an additional drop in the dollar. Economists worry that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' status as the world's biggest debtor nation _ it owed $ 368 billion at the end of last year _ makes it vulnerable to a sharp drops in the value of the dollar or skyrocketing interest rates should foreigners decided to pull their money out But the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> said `` such concerns are exaggerated or unwarranted.'' It said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> debt in comparison to the size of its economy is modest by international standards and said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` remains an extremely attractive place to invest.'' In another part of the report, the administration said its policy of coordinating intervention in currency markets with other major industrial nations has proved `` more helpful than previously thought'' in stabilizing exchange rates even though the interventions were small relative to total currency trading. It said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> spent $ 8.5 billion to prop up the value of the dollar as it was falling in 1987 and sold $ 1.4 billion in dollars to curb its appreciation this year.

 Two jewels in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s musical crown, the <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION> Symphony and coloratura soprano <PERSON> Dame </PERSON> <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON>, presented a brilliant concert for this year's United Nations Day celebration on Monday night. The concert in the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> is an annual event commemorating the birth of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> on Oct. 24, 1945, and Secretary General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> greeted the audience with a brief statement before the performance. The appearance by the <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION> Symphony, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s oldest musical institution, came as it makes its first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tour, which began Oct. 16 and continues through Nov. 6, part of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s Bicentennial celebrations PBS has televised U.N. Day concerts for 20 years. This year the concert will air on Wednesday at 9:30 p.m. EDT. After three instrumental pieces, conducted by <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Challender </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dame </PERSON> <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> sang some music from the first act of `` La Traviata,'' concluding with `` Sempre libera.'' Her husband, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonynge </PERSON>, conducted for her. A month before her 63rd birthday, her voice was glorious. Singing in the opera's original key, she hit every coloratura note squarely and with apparent ease, hit high notes without scooping up to them. After intermission, she sang the title character's entrance in `` The Merry Widow'' and `` Vilia,'' beautifully sustaining the mood of that haunting song. The concert ended with her singing from `` <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sonnambula </LOCATION>,'' one of the bel canto operas which introduced her to American audiences. She spun the melodic lines, made perfect delicate trills and was altogether thrilling. The concert began with `` Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks'' by <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>. <PERSON> Challender </PERSON> emphasized the lyricism of the music. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, with its wood strips on the walls and wooden desks, is acoustically warm, abetting the conductor's approach of making the music sing. Till's rudest pranks were not depicted in vulgar tones in this presentation. Next came `` The Display Suite,'' which Australian composer <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> took from his 1963 score for the Australian Ballet about a bird's wooing its mate. The suite is accessible and pleasing, beginning with an atonal introduction and the bird represented by a piccolo. A remarkably cheery waltz, sounding almost Viennese, follows. After that comes rich music for an unhurried love duet and a mildly percussive finale. The orchestra also played <PERSON> Ravel </PERSON>'s `` La Valse'' with <PERSON> Challender </PERSON> emphasizing the shimmer, while keeping tension and flow, and again downplaying any ominous undercurrents. The orchestra sounded fine. Not overwhelmed by the strings, the brass especially, and also woodwinds and percussion, made the most of their moments to shine.

 <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> hacked the husk off a coconut with an axe and glanced at the skewed remants of his home. `` I'm just thinking,'' he said, tipping back his baseball cap. `` I ca n't just march in there and take my things out. The rest of it -LRB- the house -RRB- will come down on my head.'' <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> was one of tens of thousands of <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> coastal residents left homeless after Hurricane <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> crashed into <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> before dawn Saturday. Preliminary figures put casualties from the hurricane's 24-hour rampage across <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> at 50 people dead and 300,000 homeless. On Monday, residents of <LOCATION> Bluefields </LOCATION>, 180 miles east of the capital of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, began rebuilding their lives. <LOCATION> Bluefields </LOCATION> has a population of 38,000 and the storm killed 21 people in the area. Some residents picked through rubble seeking prized possessions or building material. The cobblestone streets were littered with piles of wood and rusted metal. Some women gathered to obtain government-provided rice, beans, milk and cooking oil. `` The soap is already gone,'' said <PERSON> Argentina </PERSON> <PERSON> Casco </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutierez </PERSON> as she carried provisions back to what was left of her wooden-plank home. The hurricane winds of more than 125 mph destroyed the wooden homes, many that dated back to the last century when the so-called <LOCATION> Miskito </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> belonged to <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. A few structures made of concrete withstood the storm. The view from a helicopter of the city showed virtually no roof unscathed. Most were torn off completely. The city's only hospital suffered severe damage but was open Monday. An official, <PERSON> Reynaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguilar </PERSON>, said 150 <LOCATION> Bluefields </LOCATION> residents suffered injuries, mostly shock. <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Senteno </PERSON> <PERSON> Vale </PERSON> became a father of nine on Sunday when his wife gave birth to a daughter the day after the hurricane struck. `` She does n't have a name,'' he said of the infant. `` I'm going to call her <PERSON> Joan </PERSON>.'' Thousands of people remained in government shelters. Many coastal residents waited until shortly before the full force of the hurricane struck before going to the shelters. `` We all held hands so we would n't be blown away,'' <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Aster </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerth </PERSON>, 33, sat on the curb across from the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, a shelter where he and about 800 other people are staying. He said many of the victims feared looting. `` They come at night to go through the things,'' he said of thieves and then added: `` I'm going to rebuild my home one way or another. But we need help.'' <PERSON> Gerth </PERSON>, a fisherman, asked a reporter: `` Do you think the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will help? The Russians and the Cubans ca n't do what the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can.'' President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, who visited <LOCATION> Bluefields </LOCATION> Monday, said his government would accept aid from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> if it comes `` without conditions.'' But in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> was using the tragedy of the storm as propaganda against the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's support of Nicaraguan rebels who have been fighting the leftist government for seven years. He said no request for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid had been received from the Nicaraguan government and none was expected.

 A tanker-truck hauling 3,000 gallons of molasses lost its brakes and overturned, spilling about half its sticky load onto a highway, police said.

To prevent the syrup from running into highway drains and a reservoir, crews built a dike of logs, stones and mud. Sawdust and sand also was spread.

 The mercy mission of six former Marines to clear mines in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> is an exchange of good will that the Vietnamese hope will blossom into diplomatic recognition, an infusion of aid and the lifting of a trade embargo. Three of the Americans who are going on the Jan. 9 mission, <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spanos </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Rosemont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dalton </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Davidsonville </LOCATION>, Md.; and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Noe </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Stoughton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, were at the Vietnamese mission to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> on Monday. They met with Ambassador <PERSON> Trinh </PERSON> <PERSON> Xuan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lang </PERSON>, head of the Vietnamese mission, and reviewed their planned nine-day trip to former battlefields below the Demilitarized Zone, including <LOCATION> Khe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sanh </LOCATION> where <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> withstood a 77-day siege in 1968. Their sentiments were expressed in a plaque presented to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> with the inscription: `` In the hopes of preserving the peace, we come to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> once again, this time to help the preservation of human life. 11th Engineers January 1989.'' The humanitarian `` people-to-people'' visit is private and is being paid for by an anonymous businessman. The other Marines in the group returning to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> from the 11th Engineer Battalion, 3rd Marine Division, are <PERSON> Nate </PERSON> <PERSON> Genna </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Roxbury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>, of <PERSON> Langdon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kan </PERSON>. The mission to verify the Vietnamese claim that they have removed all of the land mines the Americans planted 20 years ago is the latest in a series of gestures between the two countries to improve relations. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, one of the poorest countries in the world, badly needs <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid it likely would receive with normalization of diplomatic relations. <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Xuan </PERSON> <PERSON> Oanh </PERSON>, a member of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> and a key economic adviser, conferred with American businessmen this month on a rare visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Oanh </PERSON> said again that <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> will withdraw its 100,000 to 120,000 troops from neighboring <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> by the end of 1990, a condition <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has imposed before it will recognize the <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> government. And just last month, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> began joint searches for witnesses of wartime plane crashes in efforts to find the remains of some of the 1,757 Americans missing in action and presumed dead. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says it has no evidence that any of them are alive but it is seeking an accounting. At a joint news conference Monday, <PERSON> Lang </PERSON> said the mines had all been cleared at the cost of thousands of civilians killed, particularly from the end of the war in 1975 until 1978 when land was being cleared for farming and housing. <PERSON> Spanos </PERSON> said the 11th Engineers planted about 100,000 mines below the Demilitarized Zone between 1966 and 1969 and left them intact when they pulled out. He said American veterans visiting hospitals in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> had seen children who had been killed and maimed by old mines. `` No one knows for sure,'' said <PERSON> Spanos </PERSON>. `` Basically what Ambassador <PERSON> Lang </PERSON> has said is true, that a lot of areas have been cleared, but exactly where these people are still coming up from being injured, we want to go back, review, walk the terrain, write our reports and submit our findings to both governments.'' They will be working with reconstructed battlefield maps and have asked the Vietnamese for a team of their counterparts to accompany them. The ambassador and <PERSON> Spanos </PERSON> agreed that the most important part of the mission is a better understanding between the countries. `` They are welcome,'' said <PERSON> Lang </PERSON>. `` They return without any animosity. From the beginning of this year till now, from 60 to 80 American teams have visited <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, journalists, congressmen, senators, scholars and tourists. These visits will contribute to better understanding.'' <PERSON> Spanos </PERSON> said letters of support his team has received from Americans across the country, veterans and non-veterans, has been phenomenal.

 Democratic vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is bringing his attack on <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> campaign ads from factories to churches to farmers in hopes of winning a backlash vote in key states. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator travels today to the <LOCATION> Dakotas </LOCATION> and to <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. It's the first time since a single stop in <LOCATION> Minot </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>, in July that the Democratic ticket has made an appearance in that region. The trip will include a visit to White, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, where the <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> family first came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>. Besides showing Democratic interest in those states, normally a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> stronghold, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> will keep up his strident attacks on the Republican tactics. Those efforts have taken on nearly a missionary zeal, as the Democrats struggle to come from behind in the final two weeks of the campaign. `` They're bearing false witness against <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told a rally at the <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paradise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, on Monday night. `` And we're going to set that record straight.'' `` The truth is catching up, and the power of the truth will prevail,'' said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, who joined the church in singing `` The Battle Hymn of the Republic.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> launched his final 16-day campaign push in the Republican city of <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rapids </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, on Monday. He told reporters there the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> campaign had racial overtones because of its focus on the case of convicted murderer <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who raped a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> woman last year after <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> had escaped from a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> prison furlough. `` They are obviously dealing with a black man who, in that instance, had raped a white woman, and that certainly came through in the ad,'' said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. Asked what came through, he replied: `` Racism.'' From the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> businessmen, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Girardeau </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, where he told clothing workers that the Republicans were trying to distract them from issues where the Democrats had the more attractive policies _ issues like trade, the minimum wage, and health insurance.

 A six-story building in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s Garment District collapsed Monday, killing one man and injuring at least 10 people, including a woman who was trapped for more than eight hours in the rubble. The collapse caused a major disruption of rail and subway service and street traffic just before rush hour. About eight hours later, a body was pulled from the rubble and tentatively identified as the building's owner, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> DeSantos </PERSON>, who had been last seen on the roof, Police Chief <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> identified the injured woman pulled from the rubble as <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>, who was conscious and talking when rescued and was taken to <LOCATION> Bellevue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. She was in critical but stable condition in the emergency room early Tuesday, said <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Marletta </PERSON>, the hospital administrator on duty. At midnight, officials believed that all people had been accounted for, including two earlier thought missing, said <PERSON> Homer </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON>, chief of operations for the <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Rescuers continued clearing the rubble with machines. Nine people suffered what were described as minor injuries when the building's west wall and the interior structure collapsed, Fire Commissioner <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> said. Six of the injured were taken to <LOCATION> Bellevue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> and three to <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vincent </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>. All were reported to be in stable condition. Service on most West Side subway lines, the <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Road </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>'s trans-Hudson lines was halted for more than an hour in response to fire department concerns about vibrations and noise. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Burgos </PERSON>, who watched the collapse from his store across the street, said: `` It made a sound like a swoosh. ... I watched the top floors crumble. As they fell, men were actually coming out of the side of the walls, climbing down the debris. It looked like they did n't have a choice.'' The cause of the collapse was not immediately known, but fire department spokesman <PERSON> Efrain </PERSON> <PERSON> Parrilla </PERSON> said a trench had been dug along one wall of the building, where it adjoined a parking lot. He said the wall had been propped up with 2-by-4 boards. City Buildings Commissioner <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said there was some sort of work being done on the building Monday, but he did n't know the nature of it. He said no permits had been issued, however, and no plans had been filed for work at the building. The building, on West 31st Street, housed a handbag manufacturing company and other fashion-related businesses. <PERSON> Parrilla </PERSON> said 13 people were believed to have been in the building when it collapsed about 3 p.m. Tax records show the owner to be a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> company named 63 <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, which is listed in the telephone book under a different address, but its telephone service was disconnected. Service was temporarily halted on all subway lines running near the building, which is between <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION> and Fifth Avenue, to reduce underground vibrations that could cause further collapse and noise that could hamper searchers. In addition, streets around the site were closed, clogging traffic at the start of the evening rush. A little more than an hour after trains were stopped, transit agencies were told they could begin resuming service as long as trains did not exceed 10 mph. The Transit Authority estimated the disruption was affecting 125,000 people per hour. `` It's a major, major disruption,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Previdi </PERSON>. `` It's going to be a very long rush hour.'' The collapse apparently occurred when the wall of the building fell away and the interior floors tumbled to the ground. What remained was a partial shell of the building, leading authorities to worry that the remaining walls might collapse. A crane was brought in just before 8 p.m. to pull down the unstable brick facade of the building so rescue workers could safely continue to search for the missing people. `` It's an immediate danger and a constant threat to rescue workers,'' said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. `` Only air and memory is holding the front of the building up.'' He said it would take from 24 to 48 hours to finish going through the rubble.

<HEAD>Some Western-Style Campaigning Proposed In One-Party Nation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soviet citizens may see some Western-style campaigning for the first time next spring under a draft law that would permit competing candidates, television time and a campaign staff. The law says candidates for the 2,250 seats in the new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies will be given time off from work to campaign, free public transportation within their district, and access to the state-run media. They also may ask 10 friends to help them campaign. But it seems competing political parties are still out of bounds and unaffiliated candidates will be restricted in what they can advocate, since the Constitution defines the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as a socialist nation led by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` The program of the candidate must not contradict the Constitution or Soviet law,'' says the draft election law published in weekend newspapers. The election proposal is part of an overhaul of the government proposed by President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at the party conference in June. The lengthy draft laws are to be debated in the media before the current Supreme Soviet legislature considers them in November. Traditionally, Soviet elections have had only one candidate for each position, so campaigning was limited to a biography and a few nights to meet the candidate. Election officials obtained 99 percent turnouts by persuading busy citizens to have a relative vote on their behalf. Fledgling opposition groups like the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> may be restricted by a requirement that candidates for territorial districts be nominated by workers' groups of at least 500 people. But the draft law offers a chance to such large groups as nationalistic organizations in <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> that have won official approval by advocating not just cultural freedom but also economic reforms akin to those of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Among the groups, the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estonia </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Lithuanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Restructuring </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> have said they plan to put forward candidates. The draft law also gives candidates complete immunity from arrest and prosecution without approval of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, a provision that a legal expert writing in the latest edition of <ORGANIZATION> Ogonyok </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> said is necessary to ensure deputies against unjust persecution. `` Imagine an unprotected deputy controls the prosecutor's office, exposes illegalities, tries to fight the mafia, and courageously criticizes the police and prosecutors at a session of the council,'' said A.N <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON>, a professor of law at the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>. `` This can not be a reality, because tomorrow he will be arrested on trumped-up charges. And he will have nobody to protect him.'' In the same article, however, <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON> said constitutional and election reforms will leave the deputies powerless as long as bureaucrats control the budgets. The draft law calls for creation of a new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies that will meet once a year and elect an unstated number of their members to the Supreme Soviet, the country's parliament The congress also will elect the president to a five-year term. The congress will consist of three groups of 750 deputies each. The first two groups, popularly elected, will represent territorial districts divided by population and by ethnic group. The third group will be elected by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, trade unions, cooperatives and other organizations.

<HEAD>Frozen Corpses Yield Drug-Resistant Bacteria That Predate
Antibiotics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Frozen corpses of two seamen who died during a doomed Arctic expedition in 1848 contain bacteria that show unexpected resistance to antibiotics developed more than 120 years later, scientists say. Because there is evidence that lead poisoning killed the men, the researchers speculate that heavy metal pollutants, not just overuse of antibiotics, may play a role in creating disease germs that survive drugs. The proliferation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria has become a major problem, especially in Third World nations where the drugs are used indiscriminately, killing vulnerable bacteria and allowing resistant bacteria to reproduce. For example, strains of gonorrhea have become resistant to spectinomycin, penicillin and tetracycline. The use of antibiotics to keep livestock healthy also has been blamed for the spread of drug-resistant salmonella bacteria that cause human food poisoning. But medical microbiologist Dr. <PERSON> Kinga </PERSON> <PERSON> Kowalewska-Grochowska </PERSON> said the study she conducted with colleagues at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alberta </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Edmonton </LOCATION> has prompted her to speculate environmental pollution may spur development of some antibiotic-resistant germs. She presented the study Monday during the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Microbiology </ORGANIZATION>'s 28th Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, a meeting of 13,000 cancer, AIDS and infectious disease specialists. The bacteria came from the bodies of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Braine </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartnell </PERSON>, two of the 129 men who died in the <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> during Sir <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>'s doomed 1845-1848 search for a Northwest Passage connecting the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. In 1986, the well-preserved bodies were among three retrieved from graves in the permafrost on <LOCATION> Beechy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, west of <LOCATION> Baffin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Territories </LOCATION>, by Canadian anthropologist <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Beattie </PERSON>, co-author of the 1987 book `` Frozen in Time: Unlocking the Secrets of the Franklin Expedition.'' Six types of `` bacteria lying dormant for over a century were found in the bowel contents'' of <PERSON> Braine </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hartnell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kowalewska-Grochowska </PERSON> said. `` The organisms apparently survived 140 years in permafrost. They grew sufficiently in the laboratory to be identified and tested for susceptibility to currently used antibiotics.'' She said two of the six strains of bacteria _ all of which belong to the Clostridium genus, or group of species _ were found to be partly resistant to the antibiotics cefoxitin, which was introduced in 1978, and clindamycin, introduced in 1970. The surprising discovery may spur revision of the theory that the proliferation of bacteria that survive antibiotics is solely caused by widespread use and abuse of antibiotics that kill vulnerable germs, she said. Starvation, scurvy and cannibalism apparently claimed the lives of most members of the expedition, she said. The crews sailed from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> aboard the HMS Terror and HMS Erebus, then abandoned the vessels when they became trapped in ice. But high lead levels found in the three bodies on <LOCATION> Beechy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> suggest some of them died from toxic lead that leaked into food from solder in food tins, she added. Resistance to antibiotics may be induced by the body's reaction to heavy metals, <PERSON> Kowalewska-Grochowska </PERSON> said, speculating that `` environmental pollution may be contributing to the development of resistance'' to antibiotics by bacteria. `` It's totally speculative,'' said microbiologist <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Kornfeld </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Microbiology </ORGANIZATION>, but added the hypothesis could be tested by growing modern-day bacteria with increasing concentrations of lead and determining if they start to resist antibiotics. <PERSON> Kornfeld </PERSON> said some chemical component or structural feature of modern antibiotics may have existed in 1848, inducing resistance in the bacteria found in <LOCATION> Braine </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Hartnell </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kowalewska-Grochowska </PERSON> said tissue specimens from the corpses were kept frozen in sterile containers until bacterial tests were performed, assuring they really were 140-year-old bacteria. Some tissues also contained streptococcal bacteria, but those were identified as modern bacteria, probably from members of <PERSON> Beattie </PERSON>'s team who accidentally sneezed on the bodies, she added The types of Clostridium bacteria found can cause gangrene and abcesses, while related species cause botulism and tetanus, <PERSON> Kowalewska-Grochowska </PERSON> said. Clindamycin and cefoxitin are used to treat a variety of serious infections, including of the lungs and bones. Many have credited <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> with discovering the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Passage </ORGANIZATION>, but his ships only reached a point not far from waters that led to <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, according to The World Book Encyclopedia, which says Norwegian explorer <PERSON> Roald </PERSON> <PERSON> Amundsen </PERSON> completed the first trip through the passage in 1906.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, declaring his uphill presidential effort `` one for the people of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' vowed a continued assault on <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> campaign tactics and promised to balance his salvos with discussion of key issues. To that end, the Democratic presidential nominee said Monday night he would improve the nation's secondary schools partly by tying some federal funding to improved academic performance. He offered the plan at a town meeting at <ORGANIZATION> Hayward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, telling <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area residents, `` I do n't know of anything that cries out more for presidential leadership'' than education. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was wrapping up a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> campaign trip today faced with a new <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll that showed him trailing Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by 11 points in the state, which holds the top <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> prize of 47 votes. The poll released in today's editions of the Times showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> leading <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> 53-42 percent in the state. The Times questioned 1,376 registered voters during the fours days that ended Sunday and the margin of error was four percentage points.

He ended his day Monday at one such gathering, telling cheering supporters that `` either you're all crazy or we're going to win on the 8th of November.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> saluted the campaign volunteers and promised to close the campaign with a flourish. `` This one is for you,'' he said. `` This one is for the people of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' For the past week <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has focused on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign tactics, accusing the vice president of distorting <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' positions and record and using `` outright lies'' as part a calculated effort to avoid discussion of substantial issues `` I'm bound and determined that over the course of the next two weeks I'm going to take my case directly to the people of this country,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told the town meeting in <LOCATION> Hayward </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who trails <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in national polls as well, acknowledged his slip was probably fueled by his failure to respond immediately and aggressively to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s attacks. `` I'm not going to let him get away with that stuff,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` I'll see if I can strike a reasonably good balance'' between assailing the Republicans and discussing his proposals. His spoke briefly to the meeting about his latest, the secondary education plan, and aides distributed a position paper outlining the three-point proposal. The plan calls for encouraging improvements in science and computer teaching by, in part, tying eligibility for certain federal education funding to progress toward national performance standards. Also included is a proposal for job placement services for high school students who decide not to attend college. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> issues adviser <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> said funding levels for the federal incentives included in the plan would depend on efforts to reduce the federal budget deficit. Those incentives would include grants to schools that establish model programs for exceptional and learning-disabled students.

 The <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> will send representatives to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in January to hold the Tibetan government-in-exile's first official talks in four years with <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> officials, his office said today Spokesman <PERSON> Lodi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyari </PERSON> said the exact date has not been set yet. The two sides met at <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in 1982 and then again in 1984 to seek to resolve the issue of Tibetan autonomy. <PERSON> Gyari </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> would not participate in the talks. `` His Holiness will definitely not be present at the talks. He might be present at a later stage to meet with top <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government officials like <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ping </PERSON>, but not now,'' the spokesman said. The <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, god-king of the Tibetans, fled his homeland in 1959 after the Chinese occupation of <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> and took exile in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, where he set up a government-in-exile.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> demanded that the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> release a $ 14 million jetliner impounded after agents found 56 pounds of cocaine aboard, saying it is an ally, not an enemy, in the war against drugs. Monday's discovery of a bag of cocaine aboard an L-1011 a day after it arrived here from <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, was the fourth drug confiscation involving an Eastern flight since August. The <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said the plane would not be released until <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> pays a fine of $ 896,000 _ or $ 1,000 an ounce _ and pledges to improve drug security. Eastern executives, who are appealing $ 13 million in fines from the three earlier seizures, said they found the latest action difficult to understand. `` We are not an adversary. We are cooperating with the government,'' said <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Azzam </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agent hired as the airline's top drug security officer. `` We provided information about the possible shipment of drugs and we're being punished for providing the information,'' added airline spokeswoman <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON>. `` We do n't believe this will help the good working relationship we have with the federal agencies.'' <PERSON> Azzam </PERSON> said the Miami-based airline is spending $ 3 million on security, but drug traffickers will continue to use airliners to transport contraband. Agents discovered the cocaine in an orange nylon <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Mail bag with a standard baggage tag. Flight 505 had proceeded from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Sunday but was seized soon after it made the return trip Monday, Customs officials said. `` We are not asking <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> to become a law enforcement officer,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>, assistant district director of the Customs office at <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. `` Someone who has access to the airline has to be involved here and in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. `` The government is not at war with the airlines,'' he added. `` But it's not enough for the government to do it alone.'' In the four seizures since August, 494 pounds of cocaine has been found aboard Eastern aircraft. Since March 1982, Customs has seized 20 planes, a fourth of them private aircraft, at <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, agency spokesman <PERSON> Clif </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Azzam </PERSON> estimated that the latest jet seizure was costing Eastern $ 40,000 to $ 50,000 a day. The carrier has trimmed back international flights as part of cost-cutting efforts, which include a plan to lay off 4,000 workers. The only other Eastern plane seized by Customs in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> was in March 1984, said <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON>. Earlier this month, an Eastern plane with 20 pounds of cocaine aboard was seized in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> flying the same route, but was allowed to leave four hours behind schedule. Four months ago, <ORGANIZATION> Avianca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colombia </ORGANIZATION> said it would no longer haul cargo from <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> because of the millions of dollars in fines it has had to pay in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as a result of cocaine seizures, chiefly from flower shipments. No one has been arrested in connection with Monday's seizure, Customs said.

<TEXT>
 The USS Vincennes came home to an emotional welcome after a six-month deployment marred by the crew's accidental downing of an Iranian jetliner over the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, killing the 290 people aboard `` We're glad to be home, I assure you of that,'' Capt. <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said after the guided-missile cruiser docked at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> on Monday. `` This is a nice place.'' <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION>' 400-man crew cheered loudly as he walked down the gangway. The captain got a kiss, a hug and flowers from his wife, <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>. After a brief welcoming ceremony, the sailors poured off the ship into a sea of relatives, friends and fellow servicemen. `` Hi, daddy. You're home!'' a little girl said as she waved to her father. Petty Officer 3rd Class <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Hile </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Niles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, got a warm embrace from his girlfriend, <PERSON> Vallita </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawwill </PERSON>. `` I do n't even know what we were doing there,'' <PERSON> Hile </PERSON> said. `` It's a tragedy that it happened. But I'm glad I'm home and I'm alive. The <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> mistook the <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> jetliner for an Iranian F-14 fighter jet when it shot the aircraft down July 3, according to the official <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> report on the tragedy. The report concluded that the warship's crew misinterpreted computer and radar data because of the stress of being in combat for the first time. At the time, the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> was in a firefight with several Iranian gunboats. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> disputed that conclusion Monday. `` It's my opinon that stress was not a factor,'' he said. `` Given all of the information available and in view of the ongoing continuum of violent and aggressive Iranian action, I was convinced beyond any doubt that the inbound aircraft was in direct support of the surface engagement in progress,'' <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said. `` There, of course, were mistakes made and there always are in an intense combat environment,'' <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said. `` But both my crew and the system performed basically as designed. `` I, as well as my crew, will live with the result of the tragic loss of civilian lives associated with these actions, tempered only by the belief I had no other course of action and that any prudent commanding officer would do the same.'' <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said the fate of the USS Stark, on which 37 sailors died in an Iraqi missile attack in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, was in the back of his mind throughout his ship's mission. `` No skipper sails in the gulf without the Stark at least in your subconscious,'' <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said. `` Was it a factor during that decision process? I do n't consciously remember.'' Responding to a question from an Iranian reporter, <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said he regretted the loss of civilian life. The captain said he knew within 90 minutes of ordering two missiles fired that the downed airplane was a civilian airliner. He said he later assembled the crew to tell them the news, which they took quietly. `` At first we were all devastated,'' <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said. `` It goes without saying. But I have to look at it, and my crew looks at it, that given the fact that the airliner made no indication that it was not a hostile craft, we had no other choice.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to return a 1,000-year-old stone carving that <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> says disappeared from a sacred temple two decades ago, in hopes of ending a nine-month international dispute. But a Thai group says it wo n't be satisfied until its government approves the plan. `` We can not say that it is resolved until complete agreement is reached between the <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> and the Thai government,'' said <PERSON> Wutisak </PERSON> <PERSON> Lapcharoensap </PERSON>, spokesman of the Thai <ORGANIZATION> Vishnu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lintel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, based in suburban <LOCATION> Evanston </LOCATION>. The institute announced Monday it would return the lintel to <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> in exchange for a Thai artifact `` of equal artistic merit'' to be donated by the Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Elizabeth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cheney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a philanthropic group that wanted to help resolve the dispute. The lintel, a 2-by-3 foot stone crosspiece designed to fit above a door or window, depicts the Hindu god Vishnu reclining on water. It dates to <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s Khmer dynasty from A.D. 805-1250. It disappeared from the Phnom Rung temple, a national monument in northeastern <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> during the 1960s, <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> officials say. The lintel was first displayed at the institute 21 years ago. But museum officials said they did not learn until February that the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> government wanted it returned for the temple's restoration. Thai demonstrators protested outside the museum earlier this year, hoping to have the lintel returned in time for reopening ceremonies at the Thai temple in May. Museum spokeswoman <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Voedisch </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> officials had been told of the decision to return the lintel, but she did not think an official response had been received by the institute. Monday's announcement came a day before a Thai representative and others demanding the lintel were scheduled to testify at a <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> committee meeting, <PERSON> Lapcharoensap </PERSON> said. He said the meeting would be held today despite the announcement. <PERSON> Lapcharoensap </PERSON> said the institute had said earlier it wanted to return the lintel, but nothing was done. `` If I have some skepticism, it's justified,''' he said. The institute said it got the lintel from the Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Alsdorf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, which acquired it in 1967 through a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> art dealer. The institute said the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> dealer had purchased the carving from a dealer in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> in 1966, where it was offered for sale on the open market. The museum said it agreed to return the lintel, with the help of the <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION> foundation, to `` resolve the stalemate in negotiations and maintain the positive relationship that existed between <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' `` We are pleased to resolve this issue,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, the institute's director. `` This solution meets our requirement for just compensation.'' Ms. <PERSON> Voedisch </PERSON> said museum and <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION> foundation officials would have to agree on the piece to be donated in exchange for the lintel, and that a decision was expected soon. `` Upon receipt of this gift, the <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> will relinquish all rights and title to the lintel and donate it to <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>,'' the museum said.

 <PERSON> Garfield </PERSON> pined for the comforts of home while outdoors in a rainstorm, and <PERSON> Marmaduke </PERSON> invited homeless dogs to his house for breakfast as cartoonists focused on the plight of the needy in today's comic pages. More than 100 comic-strip and editorial cartoonists, including the creators of `` Garfield'' and `` Marmaduke,'' participated. `` The goal of the project is to tug at <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s heart strings through its funny bones. Tomorrow's funny pages are not going to be so funny,'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Zigas </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Low </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Income </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, said during a news conference Monday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Some of the cartoons had a serious tone. Others found a humorous tilt to a not-so-funny issue. In `` The Lockhorns'' a suited-man tells a homeless man cooking over a fire, `` I'd ask you home for a good home-cooked meal but you're better off here.'' `` It's not going to change things overnight; it's just one more expression of the movement,'' said cartoonist <PERSON> Mell </PERSON> <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON>, who draws the comic strip `` Momma.'' In his strip, <PERSON> Momma </PERSON>'s son raids her refrigerator because he does n't have any food at his apartment. <PERSON> Momma </PERSON> tells him, `` <PERSON> Francis </PERSON>, do you realize there are people in this country who are totally homeless, while you have two of them?'' `` If a kid tells his parents, ` Hey look. All the comics are about homeless people today,' we will at least have raised their consciousness,'' <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON> said Monday in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. In `` The Family Circus'', by <ORGANIZATION> Bil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Keane </ORGANIZATION>, a youngster asks about a homeless man sleeping on a bench, ` But, if he does n't have a home, how can his children come for a visit?'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>, editorial cartoonist for the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` I'm participating because I'm trying to attract attention to the homeless, but I've been drawing about the homeless for years and so far it has n't had any effect.'' His cartoon on the homeless will appear later this week. In the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>, editorial cartoonist <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Holbert </PERSON> showed a homeless man on a park bench covered with newspapers advertising expensive houses. The Atlanta Constitution's <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Marlette </PERSON>, winner of this year's Pulitzer Prize for editorial cartoons, showed a group of street people with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Capitol in the distance The caption reads: `` Land of the Free, Homeless of the Brave.'' In The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>, editorial cartoonist <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Morin </PERSON> drew a bedraggled man slumped in a doorway flanked by shopping bags overflowing with clothes. Near the door is a sign with the message: `` Home is where the heart is n't.'' <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> DeOre </PERSON>, of The Dallas Morning News, fashioned a weather face formed by the words: mentally ill; jobless; addiction; illiteracy. <PERSON> Zigas </PERSON>, noting that there are no official counts of the number of homeless, said national estimates range from 350,000 to more than 3 million. `` Hunger and homelessness are not partisan issues, they are human tragedies that deserve our immediate attention,'' said <PERSON> Zigas </PERSON>, an organizer of the cartoonists' effort. `` There is a shameful level of hunger in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, although it is not as visible as homelessness,'' added <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Fersh </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. Millions more than that are hungry, <PERSON> Fersh </PERSON> said, adding that children make up a large share of those without enough to eat. Other cartoonists participating included <PERSON> Garry </PERSON> <PERSON> Trudeau </PERSON>, author of `` Doonesbury;'' <PERSON> Dik </PERSON> <PERSON> Browne </PERSON>, creator of `` <PERSON> Hagar </PERSON> the Horrible;'' `` B.C.'' artist <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>; and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Batiuk </PERSON>, developer of `` Crankshaft.''

The union, an affiliate of the 1 million-member <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION>, won the election on a 1,530-1 ,486 vote in which more than 90 percent of eligible workers cast ballots `` The allegations do not suggest that the election was beclouded by threats, violence, vandalism, reprisals or the traditional forms of voter intimidation,'' <PERSON> Harmatz </PERSON> wrote. `` Indeed, none of the conduct subject to litigation in this proceeding would constitute an unfair labor practice.'' <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>'s brief in the case, <PERSON> Harmatz </PERSON> said, `` is replete with misinterpretations of the record'' of eight days of hearings the <ORGANIZATION> NLRB </ORGANIZATION> held in August on the university's charges. `` Because these references either are not supported by, or grossly overstate the proven facts, this decision seeks to, at this level, bring a halt to this approach,'' the judge said. <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Marjorie </PERSON> <PERSON> Heffron </PERSON> said no decision has been made on whether to appeal <PERSON> Harmatz </PERSON>'s ruling to the full five-member board. Under the law, it has two weeks to file an appeal. `` The university's position is sound, and the union acted improperly,'' <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> Vice President for Finance <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said in a statement. `` It is plain that the opinion -LRB- by <PERSON> Harmatz </PERSON> -RRB- does not accurately reflect the record of the hearings in many respects.'' The union drive, which began in 1975, and the university's challenge had been viewed by several labor leaders as a major test of their ability to organize educated, white - and gray-collar technical workers who are assuming a greater proportion of the <ORGANIZATION> AFSCME </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> McEntee </PERSON> said Monday that the election, and the <ORGANIZATION> NLRB </ORGANIZATION> action upholding the results, was crucial for <ORGANIZATION> AFSCME </ORGANIZATION> and as `` a test case for the labor movement as a whole.'' `` The issues raised in this campaign were the issues that affect the workforce of today and tomorrow _ job and family issues that include affordable, quality child care, decent pensions and benefits and flexibility in hours of work,'' he said. In the <ORGANIZATION> NLRB </ORGANIZATION> hearings, <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> alleged that union organizers harassed employees about voting, checked names of employees off a master list of supporters, paid airline tickets for vacationing workers to return to <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION> to vote and `` systematically interrogated'' workers on their intentions. <PERSON> Harmatz </PERSON> said the allegations concerned `` a perfectly legitimate, apparently successful, tactical maneuver'' by the union to win maximum support. The university ran its own aggressive campaign against unionization that included appeals from <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Bok </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 A strict curfew confined most residents of this capital to their homes today while, elsewhere on the island, police fired tear gas and charged with batons into thousands of anti-government demonstrators. Authorities imposed the curfew in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> and surrounding areas after a bomb killed eight people Monday at governing party meeting in the capital. They said the move was necessary because of reports the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, an extremist Sinhalese group, was planning an all-day strike The government said it feared a strike would trigger more violence. Police initially blamed the front for the Monday night bombing at a <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> home where members of President <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, also predominantly Sinhalese, were meeting. But party officials said today they had not ruled out the possibility the bomb was the work of opposition political parties. Violence has escalated with the approach of presidential elections scheduled for Dec. 19. The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> has accused the Sinhalese-dominated government of making too many concessions to the Tamil ethnic minority seeking a separate homeland in northern and eastern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. In the town of <LOCATION> Medawachchiya </LOCATION>, about 90 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, police today dispersed 3,000 protesters, including many <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks and schoolchildren demanding the government's resignation In <LOCATION> Welimada </LOCATION>, about 70 miles east of the capital, about 5,000 people sat down on public highways and refused to move, officials said. Police were unable to disperse them, officials said. There were no immediate reports of injuries in the protests. Police at <ORGANIZATION> Colombo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> said the death toll in the bombing Monday rose to eight after three more people died of their wounds today. At least 40 others were injured, they added. Police said two men on a motorcycle flung two pipes packed with explosives into the crowd at <LOCATION> Kotehena </LOCATION>, 2 miles north of the city center, but only one of the bombs exploded. The victims have not been identified, because the curfew prevented relatives from going to the hospital morgue to view the remains. But preliminary reports by police indicated most of the dead and the most seriously injured were local members of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The curfew was imposed at midnight Monday and was to remain in effect until 6 p.m. today. A senior <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official said the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> would meet in emergency session later today to decide whether to extend it. Streets in the capital were virtually deserted during the day. Police passes were required for anyone desiring to leave home, except for people seeking to buy food at shops near their homes, according to authorities. The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> has put up posters in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> and other parts of the country demanding <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON>'s resignation, abrogation of a peace accord aimed at ending the Tamil revolt, and the withdrawal of 47,000 Indian soldiers deployed in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> to enforce the accord. Under the Indian-brokered accord, Tamils were to receive a measure of autonomy if Tamil rebels surrendered their arms and stopped attacking Sri Lankan troops and Sinhalese civilians. The rebels refused and have been battling the Indian peacekeepers for more than a year. Tamils comprise 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people. They claim they are discriminated against in employment, education and through use of the Sinhalese language. Sinhalese, who account for 75 percent of the population, control most top government and military posts. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> became involved in the internal affairs of its island neighbor because of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s role as a regional power and the political clout of its own Tamil minority of 60 million.

<HEAD>Colorado Governor Sets Limit On Finding Site For Radioactive
Wastes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Gov. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> says federal officials have four months to find a disposal site for low-level nuclear waste from the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant or he'll try to close the plant until another site is found. `` I do n't want to give anybody any indication whatsoever that they can turn a temporary storage situation into a permanent one,'' <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> said Monday. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> needs to find a solution to this.'' The governor's remarks came as a boxcar of low-level radioactive waste was returned to the Rocky Flats plant, about 16 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. The boxcar was headed for a temporary storage site in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> but <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> sent it back Saturday, and banned further shipments to his state. Under a state permit, up to 1,600 cubic yards of solid waste can be stored at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> plant, which make plutonium triggers for nuclear warheads. It will take the plant about four months to reach that storage capacity. Between now and then, <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> said, <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION> officials must find another place to store Rocky Flats waste. If they do n't, he said, he will move to shut down the plant. <PERSON> DOE </PERSON> had planned to transfer the waste from the temporary site in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> to a permanent site in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The opening of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> site has been delayed until early next year. `` We'll cooperate with the DOE to find an alternative site until <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is open,'' <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> said. `` But I've said, ` Look, no expansion of Rocky Flats.''' <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> said he would press for a meeting of Western governors to discuss a long-term solution to the problem and planned to talk to <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION> officials in the meantime. On Sunday, <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> rejected a <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION> request to expand storage facilities for low-level radioactive waste at <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flats </ORGANIZATION> and asked that DOE not unload the rail car, which contains 140 55-gallon drums of waste.

<HEAD>Pharmacist Testifies About Drug Prescriptions For Pilot In 1985
Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A pharmacist testified that he filled prescriptions for several drugs, including an anti-anxiety drug and a muscle relaxant, for the pilot of <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> jetliner that crashed in 1985. Pharmacist <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, testifying in a lawsuit brought by <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> against the government, said he filled prescriptions for Captain <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Connors </PERSON> from 1983 until shortly before <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> Flight 191 crashed Aug. 2, 1985 at <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Connors </PERSON> was among 137 people who were killed. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said Monday that the drugs <PERSON> Connors </PERSON> obtained from his pharmacy included Stelazine, an anti-anxiety drug, and <PERSON> Robaxin </PERSON>, a muscle relaxant. The pharmacist said his pharmacy filled a prescription for Stelazine on several occasions between Sept. 21, 1982, and June 24, 1985. <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> sued the government contending air traffic controllers and weather forecasters failed to warn the flight's crew of a severe thunderstorm in the landing path. <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> pharmacist <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Warshofsky </PERSON>, in a deposition presented to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Belew </PERSON>, said that he filled prescriptions for <PERSON> Connors </PERSON> for drugs, including the tranquilizer Valium and the painkiller Percodan. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Bury </PERSON> told the judge the government will attempt to prove that <PERSON> Connors </PERSON> also had been taking Dalmane, a depressant used to treat insomnia, and several antihistamines for long periods before the crash. <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> objected to raising the drug issue, which government lawyers say will take about two weeks to present. `` To spend two weeks on an issue that could not possibly have been the cause of the accident is a waste of the court's time,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. Lawyers for the airline contend that the drug issue is irrelevant because the co-pilot, not <PERSON> Connors </PERSON>, was flying the plane at the time it crashed while attempting to land during a thunderstorm on a flight from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. Bury said the issues raises serious questions about <PERSON> Connors </PERSON>' judgment He noted that <PERSON> Connors </PERSON> did not disclose his use of the drugs to the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> as required. <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON> <PERSON> Murry </PERSON> said <PERSON> Connors </PERSON> had provided the government with enough information and the government could have obtained more if it wanted to.

<TEXT>
 A man paralyzed from the waist down when his parked car was rammed by another vehicle has lost a lawsuit because he was not wearing a seat belt when he was injured. `` The ruling was a one-time decision due to the insurance policy clause which mandates wearing a seat belt even if the car is parked and the motor off. It does not apply to the overall seat belt law,'' <PERSON> Hamm </PERSON> court spokesman <PERSON> Karl-Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> Heugemann </PERSON> said today. West German law requires all passengers in private cars to wear seat belts when the motor is running. <PERSON> Heugemann </PERSON> said the court decision only involved special daily insurance payments to the injured man during his stay in the hospital, `` which amounted to about 5,000 marks -LRB- $ 2,777 -RRB-.'' His hospital and medical care payments were not affected by the insurance clause, said <PERSON> Heugemann </PERSON>. <PERSON> Heugemann </PERSON> said the man was paralyzed in an accident at a service station while he was waiting in his parked car with the motor off. `` He was n't wearing a seat belt, and another vehicle hit his car while he was waiting for the service station to open,'' said <PERSON> Heugemann </PERSON>. He declined to provide the name of the man involved in the case, or say when he was injured.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> said today it was investigating members of the <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Berets </ORGANIZATION> after a military court convicted a sergeant of plotting to kill a Green Beret captain in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military court on <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION> convicted Sgt. Maj. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gleason </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of solicitation to commit murder and sentenced him Friday to seven years in prison, reduction in rank to private and forfeiture of all pay and allowances. The general court-martial found <PERSON> Gleason </PERSON>, 45, a <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran with 26 years in uniform, guilty of plotting to kill Capt. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumpson </PERSON>, a fellow member of the Okinawa-based <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Battalion </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. The Pacific Stars And Stripes, an army-authorized newspaper, published the first news of the court-martial and said the case `` fueled rumors here that Special Forces soldiers were smuggling guns, gold and drugs.'' Asked to comment on the report, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> declined to go into detail. `` There is an ongoing investigation into other allegedly criminal activity,'' said Capt. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Longfellow </PERSON>, a deputy public affairs officer. To comment further could prejudice the inquiry, he said. The several hundred Green Beret troops headquartered on <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION>, the southern Japanese island where some 30,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops are based, often go on training exercises in friendly <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> countries like <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, where the murder plot took place. The Stars And Stripes account of the trial said <PERSON> Gleason </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, offered <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>, an American in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, $ 50,000 to kill <PERSON> Dumpson </PERSON>. It said <PERSON> Gleason </PERSON> called off the plot when he suspected it had been discovered and, and that he was arrested in July. <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> was not further identified. The army said <PERSON> Dumpson </PERSON>, whose hometown was unavailable, continued on duty with his unit. <PERSON> Gleason </PERSON> was not given a punitive discharge, so he retained his retirement benefits.

<TEXT>
 Soviet Ambassador <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON> met poultry magnate <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Perdue </PERSON> and walked away with two `` Oven Stuffer Roasters'' and some insight into chicken processing. <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON> on Monday took a daylong tour of Perdue Farms on the Eastern Shore to get a firsthand look at the mechanics of poultry processing. As chairman and chief owner of <ORGANIZATION> Perdue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON>'s 68-year-old host oversees a chicken empire that's expected to gross more than $ 1 billion in sales this year <PERSON> Perdue </PERSON>'s face is familiar on television where he appears in his own commercials. `` It's something that's very well developed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and with <PERSON> Perdue </PERSON> especially,'' <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON> said of American poultry production. `` The problem in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is output quality and quantity.'' <PERSON> Perdue </PERSON> accompanied the ambassador and his entourage of eight including <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Liana </PERSON>, and two daughters through a hatchery in <LOCATION> Westover </LOCATION>, and a processing plant in <LOCATION> Accomac </LOCATION> that employs 1,700 people and slaughters an average 300,000 chickens a day. Afterward, he presented the diplomat with an ice chest bearing the <PERSON> Perdue </PERSON> logo that contained the two roasting chickens. The rest of the Soviet delegation from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> received similar freebies. <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON> said the visit was his first contact with chicken processing in any country. He called his trip a demonstration that `` diplomacy is not just politics, it's economic relations ... technological relations.'' The ambassador said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would like to increase chicken production.

 <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Southwell </PERSON> shed tears of joy when she saw her 8-month-old son for the first time since she was jailed almost seven weeks ago for hiding her two daughters from her ex-husband. The tears of joy turned to tears of anguish moments later. `` He did n't even remember me,'' she said, sobbing. The 26-year-old <LOCATION> Kent </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> woman alleges her ex-husband, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Southwell </PERSON>, sexually abused the girls, ages 4 and 5, during unsupervised visits. <PERSON> Southwell </PERSON>, 30, has denied the charges, saying the girls were manipulated by their mother. An ongoing investigation has turned up no evidence that he abused the girls. On Sept. 7, Ms. <PERSON> Southwell </PERSON> was jailed for contempt of court and ordered held until the girls are surrendered. Her fiance, <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Erhart </PERSON>, and relatives are caring for the Ms. <PERSON> Southwell </PERSON>'s son, fathered by <PERSON> Erhart </PERSON>, who is not part of the court order. In a telephone interview Monday from the Kent County Jail, Ms. <PERSON> Southwell </PERSON> said she shares a cell with 10 to 20 other women, including one facing a murder trial. She said she has had to fight off one attack. `` I do a lot of writing letters, reading, praying,'' Ms. <PERSON> Southwell </PERSON> said. `` And thinking.'' In a videotape shown at a hearing last month, the couple's daughters indicated they had been abused Ms. <PERSON> Southwell </PERSON> said she has not been in contact with her daughters, but is confident they are safe and healthy. `` I think about them constantly,'' she said, choking back tears. `` This is the worst thing that a loving mother could ever have to go through.'' Before making a decision on custody, Circuit Judge <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Buth </PERSON> said he wants the children to be evaluated by the county <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protective </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. Otherwise, he said, he fears Ms. <PERSON> Southwell </PERSON> may run away with the girls. `` The children are a battleground in this case,'' <PERSON> Buth </PERSON> said Friday. `` They're the ones suffering.'' <PERSON> Buth </PERSON> said he is concerned that Ms. <PERSON> Southwell </PERSON> made the allegations against her ex-husband during a custody evaluation that was in the father's favor. `` I ca n't say I've made up my mind whether sexual abuse has occurred,'' said <PERSON> Southwell </PERSON>, also of <LOCATION> Kent </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` If <PERSON> Carla </PERSON>'s so sure I sexually abused them, why does n't she give them up to protective services like the judge ordered so professionals can make a decision? I think my kids' lives need to be straightened out and <PERSON> Carla </PERSON>'s not doing that.'' Ms. <PERSON> Southwell </PERSON>, who has had temporary custody of the children, alleges the agency did a poor job in investigating her previous allegations and she said they lack concern for the children. <PERSON> Southwell </PERSON> said custody was recommended for him because his ex-wife denied him access to the children. `` This is the fifth time I've gone over two months without seeing them because <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> would n't let me,'' he said. Though a physician testified at a custody hearing that one of the girls had injuries typical of sexual abuse, an investigator with the Sheriff's Department said there was no evidence to prove <PERSON> Southwell </PERSON> was guilty. `` I believe that in her own heart and mind she believes this, but we ca n't prove that it happened,'' Sgt. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleinheksel </PERSON> said. `` All we got was a very confused statement from a child.'' Ms. <PERSON> Southwell </PERSON> said she will stay behind bars until she is assured her ex-husband will not have contact with their daughters. `` It's very difficult to accept the fact that I ca n't see my daughters, but I'll hang on and I'll fight to the last day,'' she said.

<HEAD>Maria DeSillers Loses Battle Over Final Hospital Payment</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> must pay a $ 235,000 hospital bill for her late son's three unsuccessful liver transplants, a judge has ordered. Dade Circuit Judge <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> approved a proposed settlement Monday over the objections of Ms. <PERSON> Desillers </PERSON>, who was ejected from the hearing after an outburst. The settlement, which was reached by the Children's Hospital of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gievers </PERSON>, the court-appointed curator of <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> DeSiller </PERSON>'s estate, represented a 10 percent discount on its original charge of $ 261,000. Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> was thrown out of the courtroom in the second phase of the hearing, which dealt with a $ 31,000 bill from the state. The state said it would drop the bill if the balance of the estate were turned over to the Governor's Transplant Lifeline for Children, set up to help children in <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON>'s circumstances. The judge approved the arrangement. During state testimony about the TLC program, Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> slammed her hand down on a notebook and complained that TLC turned her down when she asked for help for <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON>. `` No more outbursts,'' <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> warned. `` Do you understand me?'' `` No sir, I do n't,'' she said, `` because they did not help me with my child.'' `` Get her out of here,'' the judge ordered the bailiff. Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> contended that the hospital did not treat the boy correctly. Her attorney, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, questioned price discrepancies between allegedly similar items on the 1,700-page bill. The payment will leave <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON>'s estate with $ 25,000 to $ 30,000. Donations of more than $ 670,000 poured in from around the country while the 7-year-old endured the futile operations. Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON>, who paid $ 162,000 on the original bill of $ 424,000, balked on paying the balance last year and sued the hospital. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON>' criminal attorney, <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, who represents her in a pending investigation by the local state attorney's office, had advised her not to reveal information to the curator because it would compromise Ms. <PERSON> DeSiller </PERSON>'s guarantees against self-incrimination. <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zechman </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, said the recommendations of the curator and the judge's decision `` fully vindicate our position.'' After the hospital is paid, $ 25,000 to $ 30,000 will remain in the bank account that was set up for contributions on behalf of children in need of transplant surgery.

<HEAD>Yerkes Establishes Sperm Bank For Chimpanzees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's first sperm bank for chimpanzees is designed to meet the increasing demand for animals by AIDS researchers, the bank's founder says. Chimpanzees are highly valued in research because they are the closest biologically to humans. But they are a threatened species that can no longer be captured legally in the wild. Dr. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>, chief of reproductive biology at the <ORGANIZATION> Yerkes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Primate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said researchers there and at other centers around the world infect the animals with AIDS to study the progress of the disease in an animal with an immune system similar to man's. Unlike man, the animals do not die of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, but they can spread the virus and therefore are not allowed to breed after being infected. `` I'm glad to hear about his success,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Duane </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kraemer </PERSON>, a specialist in primate reproduction and a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> A & amp; M <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor. `` It's important that we develop techniques for sperm storage and artificial insemination for a number of species.'' The bank will help breeders maintain a genetically diverse population of captive chimps and give scientists a model for developing sperm banks for other primates such as gorillas. For more than three decades, scientists have frozen human and cattle sperm successfully, but the same formulas did not prevent ice crystals from destroying the chimpanzee sperm until <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>'s success <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> began freezing the chimpanzee sperm in 1986, and eventually found that it had to be frozen more slowly than that of other species.

<NOTE>Eds: Updates with army retracting report that 7-year-old died,
other details on violence. No pickup.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Israeli troops shot and wounded at least six Palestinians today in clashes throughout the occupied territories, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> hospital officials said. The violence occurred a day after soldiers shot and killed a 17-year-old Palestinian in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. The death brought the number of Palestinians killed in the 10-month-old Palestinian uprising to 302. Six Israelis also have died. The army, meanwhile, today retracted a report that a 7-year-old Arab boy died after being shot in the chest with a plastic bullet during a nighttime clash in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Two military spokesmen in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> called The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> to say their earlier report was erroneous and that the boy was in stable condition at <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hashomer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>. No explanation was given for the error. The boy, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Amra </PERSON>, was hit in the chest by a plastic bullet after troops fired at stone-throwing protesters in the <LOCATION> Shabura </LOCATION> neighborhood of <LOCATION> Rafah </LOCATION> on Monday night, an official at <ORGANIZATION> Nasser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Amra </PERSON> was taken intially to <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Hospital </PERSON> and later transferred to <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hashomer </LOCATION>. A hospital spokesman, Dr. <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Tirosh </PERSON>, said the boy was in intensive care with a bullet wound to the chest. Soldiers today imposed a curfew on the neighborhood where <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Amra </PERSON> was shot and troops fired tear gas at high school students who stoned soldiers elsewhere in <LOCATION> Rafah </LOCATION>, but there were no injuries, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> news reports said. <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports and witnesses said nine people were wounded today _ two of them seriously _ in confrontations in six cities and refugee camps in the occupied territories. The army said it was checking the reports. A 22-year-old man suffered a serious plastic gunshot wound in the neck when soldiers raided the village of <LOCATION> Tamoun </LOCATION> near the city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> news reports said. He was taken to <ORGANIZATION> Rafidiyeh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, the reports said. At <LOCATION> Ahli </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Rweideh </PERSON>, 26, of <LOCATION> Nozeirat </LOCATION> refugee camp in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> was reported in critical condition with a bullet wound to the chest. Two teen-agers, aged 14 and 15, were struck by plastic bullets during stoning protests in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> town of <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Deir </PERSON> el Balah refugee camp, hospital officials said. Soldiers later clamped a curfew on parts of <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON> in response to the protests and detained about a dozen Palestinians, according to <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> news reports. Elsewhere in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> oil tanker driver opened fire in a marketplace after the tire of his truck was hit by a firebomb, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> witnesses said. Three Palestinian men were hospitalized with gunshot wounds, a hospital official said. Arab reports said soldiers at scene also opened fire. It was unclear who fired the bullets that struck the Palestinians. Witnesses said a donkey was fatally shot and a horse was wounded in the incident. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>, a 15-year-old boy was hit in the abdomen by a bullet after troops opened fire on Arab stone-throwers, a local hospital official said. Soldiers also shot and wounded a 35-year-old man in the left leg during a clash with stone-throwers in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, an official at <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ittihad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> said.

 The Likud and Labor parties clashed over a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> television appearance by King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> in which the monarch said he was ready to head a <LOCATION> Jordanian-Palestinian </LOCATION> delegation in peace talks with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. In television commercials Monday, the left-wing <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> claimed <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> proved the credibility of its peace platform by announcing he was ready to take an active part in talks with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bloc </ORGANIZATION> accused Labor of being ready to hand all the territories <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war to <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> on Sunday urged Arab Israelis to participate in the Nov. 1 election and said Jewish voters should cast ballots for peace. By participating in the elections, Arabs can assure themselves of 14-15 seats in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s parliament and influence the government, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was quoted as telling <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> also said Palestinians in the occupied territories would not take up arms to continue the 10-month uprising against Israeli rule. More than 300 Palestinians and six Israelis have died in the uprising, which is a key Israeli election issue. In a hard-hitting ad with grim music, the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> showed a portrait of <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> on <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s ballot slip, indicating a vote for Labor was a vote for the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> also charged Labor with orchestrating <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s television appearance and said it was a cheap ploy to win votes Both parties showed clips of <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s interview, which was broadcast Thursday on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Nightline.'' Labor has campaigned on a peace platform based on direct negotations with a joint delegation of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and Palestinians who do not belong to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> considers a terrorist organization. The talks would be held under the aegis of an international peace conference. The campaign appeared to lose credibility after <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> announced last summer he was giving up all claims to the occupied territories and acknowledged the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s responsibility for them. In one segment of the interview, <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> praised <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>. A party spokeswoman said the interview disproved <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> claims that <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s peace proposal was unrealistic. In one commercial, Labor screened film clips of Sunday's television debate between <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> leader and Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> to support its claim the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> is intransigent about peace Labor showed one clip in which <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> distinguished between the Sinai desert, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> gave back to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in return for peace, and the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, which, he said, were an integral part of the biblical land of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> rejects the proposal for an international peace conference and opposes yielding any part of the occupied territories.

<TEXT>
 Jurors who acquitted a Navajo man in the burning deaths of two tribal police officers in December said the verdict was due to a lack of concrete evidence and witnesses' changed stories After deliberating five hours, the 12-member jury acquitted <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Atene </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of all counts Monday following his second trial in the deaths of officers <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Begay </PERSON>. While family members met the verdict with shouts and tears, <PERSON> Atene </PERSON>, 24, remained somber. `` All I can say is my cousin, brother and half brother are innocent too,'' he said. His cousin <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Cly </PERSON>, 22, and half-brother <PERSON> Vinton </PERSON> <PERSON> Bedoni </PERSON>, 31, were convicted of first-degree murder in August and sentenced to life in prison. The same jury, after deliberating for more than 46 hours, could not agree on a verdict for Atene and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> declared a mistrial. Charges against <PERSON> Atene </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Marques </PERSON> <PERSON> Atene </PERSON>, 22, were dropped when prosecutors acknowledged they did not have enough evidence to gain a conviction. Two jurors said the lack of concrete evidence led to their verdict. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwendiman </PERSON> said he was relieved that the case was over. `` It was a messy and ugly thing to have to live with for a year,'' he said. `` I just hope this verdict helps to heal the wounds. People need to get on with their lives.'' Following a murder and trial that has sharply divided the residents of <LOCATION> Monument </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Atene </PERSON> said he was not sure whether he would be able to go home again. `` I lost all my job, I lost all my brand new pickup. That's all I can say,'' <PERSON> Atene </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Atene </PERSON>'s father said earlier that the family's truck was repossessed when his son was no longer around to help make the payments. In final arguments, prosecutors and defense attorneys agreed that the verdict hinged on whether jurors believed five prosecution witnesses who testified they saw <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Atene </PERSON> at the Dec. 4, 1987, desert bonfire drinking party where the officers were shot. All five witnesses originally denied being at the party, but two decided to testify for the prosecution after they were charged with perjury. Prosecutors contended that <PERSON> Atene </PERSON> was at the drinking party and later was seen at the remote Copper Canyon site where the officers and their vehicles were doused with gasoline and set afire. <PERSON> Atene </PERSON> and members of his family said he went to bed early that night and arose before dawn to take part in a traditional Navajo healing ceremony. Several defense witnesses testified that three of the prosecution witnesses were elsewhere on the night of the bonfire. Prosecutors argued that <PERSON> Atene </PERSON> did not pull the trigger but his involvement throughout the incident made him equally guilty.

 The government today demanded an immediate meeting with <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> to prepare the way for the convening Friday of talks with the opposition on <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s future. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> rejected the demand, leaving prospects for the start to the round-table talks in doubt. Government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> said <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and Interior Minister Gen. <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> must meet Wednesday to clear away disputes on who can participate in the talks. The government objects to two names proposed by Solidarity and wants clarification on whether the individuals will respect <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s constitutional order, he said. The talks can not begin without such a preparatory meeting, Urban told reporters at his weekly news conference. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> later reiterated that he would reject any governent interference in the composition of Solidarity's delegation to the talks. He said he does not want another preparatory meeting with <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>. The two men have met three times since Aug. 31. `` I will not allow any personnel changes. It could be a precedent, a dangerous precedent for the future,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said. He said church mediator <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Stelmachowski </PERSON> was fully empowered to negotiate any other procedural or technical matters on his behalf. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, who spoke by telephone from his home in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, said he still hoped for discussions that would bring about `` understanding and the implementation of pluralism,'' and said the proposed date of Friday was acceptable to him for the talks to begin. Urban charged that Solidarity's `` stubbornness'' was preventing the talks from beginning. Urban's remarks today were the first time the government has announced a proposed date for the round-table talks. <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> and <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> agreed to such talks Aug. 31 while strikes continued around <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in the country's worst labor unrest in seven years. After begin guaranteed the talks could include the subject of Solidarity's future, as well as broader questions of economic and political pluralism in the communist country, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> ended the strikes. The opposition demands the talks lead to legalization of Solidarity, banned in 1982 after the December 1981 martial law crackdown. Solidarity had been the first recognized independent labor federation in the Soviet bloc. On Friday, Polish leader Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> said the government opposes legalizing Solidarity until the economy improves and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> changes its political system to allow more political demands outside of trade unions.

<HEAD>TV Documentary Says Three French Gangsters Killed JFK</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A British television documentary claims <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> organized crime was behind the assassination of President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, and that his shooting was carried out by three French gangsters. The two-hour Central Television program entitled `` The Men Who Killed Kennedy'' says the assassins were from <LOCATION> Marseilles </LOCATION>. The documentary is to be broadcast tonight. Details of the program were made available today. The documentary names one of the alleged killers as <PERSON> Lucien </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarti </PERSON> and says he was shot to death in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in 1972. It a second alleged killer is believed to be working in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s cocaine trade and the third is understood to be living in <LOCATION> Marseilles </LOCATION> after his recent release from prison. Central Television, a company in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s commercial <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> network, said the program was based on a four-year inquiry by American writer and researcher <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivele </PERSON> and the program's British director, <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was killed as he rode in a motorcade through <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> on Nov. 22, 1963. American <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> was charged with the shooting but was shot dead two days later in a police station by <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Warren </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> found <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> acted alone in killing <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. There have been numerous theories over the years alleging <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> was not the killer or that he was part of a conspiracy. Numerous organizations, countries and personalities have been alleged to have been involved in <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION>'s death. The program says <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and his brother <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>, then the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney-general, were cracking down on organized crime at the time of the assassination. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said: `` At last we can show that all those Americans who, for 25 years, believed in <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON>'s innocence and in a greater conspiracy were correct.'' <PERSON> Rivele </PERSON> claims in the program that the three Frenchmen alleged to have killed <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> were hired through organized crime circles in the French Mediterranean island of <LOCATION> Corsica </LOCATION>. A purported drug smuggler who claims he was offered the underworld contract to assassinate <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> but did not accept it, and a former drug trafficker who reportedly became a government informant appear on the program to support <PERSON> Rivele </PERSON>'s allegations. The documentary claims the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and French governments have sufficient evidence to act against the two surviving Frenchmen.

<TEXT>
 A delay in the production of flu vaccine will keep people from receiving influenza shots until the end of the peak time for protecting patients. But as the season approaches, <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> subscribers in 10 areas of the country were told the will receive free flu shots for the first time as part of a $ 100 million program aimed at saving the lives of thousands of people killed by influenza each year. The drug companies who make the vaccine say the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> took longer than normal to identify the strains needed in the vaccines, in part causing a two-month delay in delivering the drugs to doctors. But the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> contends the notification was n't late. Both sides agree the viruses causing this season's flu take longer to cultivate for vaccines. Shipment of vaccines will not be finished until late November _ the end of the peak period for protection, officials said. October and November are considered the best times for immunization. <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaventa </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> epidemiologist, denied the federal agency was late in notifying the drug companies. She said the strains were identified in conjunction with the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and published in the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>'s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report April 22. She said the decision is routinely made in March or April. Ms. <PERSON> Gaventa </PERSON> attributed the delay to an especially low production yield by two of the three strains covered by the vaccine. The largest producer of the vaccines, <ORGANIZATION> Wyeth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of suburban <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Davids </LOCATION>, usually has shipped most of its 9 million doses by September. This year, <PERSON> Wyeth </PERSON> will send vaccines to physicians through early to mid-November, said company spokeswoman <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashby </PERSON>. As of Monday, <PERSON> Wyeth </PERSON> had sent 90 percent of its shipments. Ms. <PERSON> Ashby </PERSON> said that although the word from the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> was later than usual, the primary cause of the delay for <PERSON> Wyeth </PERSON> was a decrease in yield by as much as 70 percent for one of the three strains. <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Molloy </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Parke-Davis </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Morris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Parke-Davis </ORGANIZATION> has sent about half its lot of 8 million doses and plans on completing shipments in mid - to late November <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Skidmore </PERSON>, spokeswoman for E.R. <ORGANIZATION> Squibb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Sons, which distributes flu vaccines manufactured by the third vaccine producer, Connaught, said their shipments of about 6 million doses should be complete by early November. At a medical meeting in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, meanwhile, Dr. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Orenstein </PERSON>, who directs the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>'s immunization division, said the Medicare-funded flu-shot demonstration project that started last week was ordered by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and will cost up to $ 25 million annually for four years. It is meant to determine if the government can save money by paying for flu shots _ rather than the cost of treating disease _ for the elderly and others most at risk of death from the flu, he said Monday. The highest risk group for the flu, and traditionally last on the list of those immunized, are older people living in close quarters in big-city nursing homes, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stehr-Green </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> immunologist. Doctors prefer to immunize them last because their systems do not hold on to the antibody as long as younger people's, he said. `` If they do n't get it in time, there's a risk of an influenza epidemic'' among older people, he said. The vaccine is suggested annually for people 65 and older and for those with heart disease, diabetes, kidney problems, sickle cell anemia and those whose spleens have been removed. Three of the locations will be announced in a few weeks when negotiations are completed. <PERSON> Orenstein </PERSON> listed the seven others as health agencies for the states of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rochester </ORGANIZATION>, which will operate a program in <LOCATION> Monroe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>; and health departments in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Allegheny </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, including <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Maricopa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, including <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>.

 Residents in this upscale suburb 12 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> say three months with the new 508 telephone area code is three months too long. The town's cry to revert back to the greater <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> area code of 617 was being heard today by the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>'s government regulations committee, which has received more than 100 letters from residents upset about the change. A bill that would force the change back was filed this summer by Rep. <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Canavan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Needham </LOCATION> when the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utilities </ORGANIZATION> rejected the town's request. `` It's one of the daily, constant little things that drive you crazy,'' said <PERSON> Canavan </PERSON>, who lives in neighboring <LOCATION> Needham </LOCATION>, which retained its 617 code. Dover is one of 193 communities given the new 508 area code by the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in an effort to avoid running out of telephone numbers in eastern <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. The 508 zone includes <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s far western suburbs, much of central <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION> and the islands, southeastern <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, Cape <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Merrimack </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION> residents say they are oriented toward <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and not central <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. But they acknowledge the town's affluence makes it liable to charges of seeking special consideration. Telephone company officials say the designations were carefully made, and they fear if <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION>'s effort is successful, other municipalities will rebel. `` Unfortunately, it's a very emotional issue,'' said <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Jung </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. `` But for some very real business reasons we had to draw the line somewhere. It was a long thoughtful process. Dover is no different from any other community. It just thinks it's different.''

 A ship sank with more than 500 people aboard during the height of Typhoon Ruby, and the <ORGANIZATION> coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> guard </ORGANIZATION> said today only 15 survivors were rescued before the search was suspended for the night. The storm, which officials said killed at least 76 people on land and left 111,000 homeless, tore through the central <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and into the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> today. Coast guard officials said the 2,845-ton <PERSON> Dona </PERSON> <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> sank Monday in the <LOCATION> Visayas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, about 300 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. It was not clear how many people were lost. Lt. <PERSON> Rey </PERSON> <PERSON> Esguerra </PERSON> of the coast guard station in <LOCATION> Cebu </LOCATION> said rescuers found 11 survivors on <LOCATION> Maripipi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and another small island and that four people were found floating in the water. <PERSON> Esguerra </PERSON> later said the search was suspended because of darkness and bad weather, but would resume at dawn Wednesday. The <PERSON> Dona </PERSON> <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> was carrying 451 passengers and 60 crew members from <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Tacloban </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Leyte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> when it radioed a distress call, said <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> Go, general manager of <ORGANIZATION> Sulpicio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>, owner of the vessel. Others missing and feared dead from Typhoon Ruby included 25 in the <LOCATION> Mindanao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> coastal city of <LOCATION> Cagayan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oro </LOCATION>, 15 in <LOCATION> Mindanao </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Zamboanga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sur </LOCATION> province and about 70 aboard a bus that plunged into a swollen river Monday. Ruby lashed the main Philippine island, <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION>, with torrential rains and wind gusts of up 140 mph. The storm caused widespread flooding on the island, triggering landslides and washing away bridges. Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Dominguez </PERSON> said preliminary estimates showed Ruby caused $ 45.7 million in crop damage. President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> Teodoro </PERSON> <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON>, said the six-province <LOCATION> Bicol </LOCATION> region of southeastern <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION> was without electricity today. The weather service said <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON>'s center passed about 50 miles east of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> and swept into the provinces of <LOCATION> Tarlac </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bulacan </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Nueva </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ecija </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>' rice-producing heartland. Government meteorologists said more than nine inches of rain fell at the <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>'s airport in 24 hours. Casualty and damage reports were incomplete because of poor communications. Figures compiled from the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and various government agencies showed 26 dead in <LOCATION> Antique </LOCATION> province, 15 in <LOCATION> Zamboanga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sur </LOCATION> province, 11 in <LOCATION> Cagayan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oro </LOCATION>, 11 in <LOCATION> Marikina </LOCATION>, six on <LOCATION> Camiguin </LOCATION> island, three in <LOCATION> Nueva </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ecija </LOCATION>, two in <LOCATION> Surigao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and one each in <LOCATION> Pampanga </LOCATION> province and <LOCATION> Bulacan </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Zamboanga </LOCATION>, two <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> navy ships _ a landing ship and a hospital vessel _ sank Monday after being battered by heavy waves. There were no casualties. Power outages and widespread flooding hit <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> early today as <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON> approached. Schools, government offices, <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>'s two stock exchanges and many private businesses were closed as strong winds buffeted the capital. Most domestic flights from <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>'s airport were canceled again today, but airport officials said international service was normal. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> said at least 110,000 of the nation's 23 million people were left homeless by the storm. Schools were closed at the American bases and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military television station said only essential personnel were on duty. Maj. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Crist </PERSON>, a spokesman at <LOCATION> Clark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION>, 50 miles north of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, reported no major structural damage, but said some aircraft were evacuated to an undisclosed `` safe location.'' Ruby was the 18th typhoon or tropical storm to hit the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> this year and was the strongest typhoon to hit <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION> since <PERSON> Patsy </PERSON>, which killed at least 175 people in 1970. <PERSON> Rodrigo </PERSON> <PERSON> Roldan </PERSON>, civil defense director on <LOCATION> Panay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, said Monday at least five people were killed when a bus careened off a bridge during heavy winds and rain, and plunged into a river. But today, <PERSON> Roldan </PERSON> said 18 people had been rescued but no bodies found. He said the bus may have carried up to 90 passengers, most of whom were either trapped inside or were swept away by flood waters.

 Discovery's five astronauts today thanked the workers here who launched them into space last month on the first post-Challenger space shuttle flight. `` If there's a heartbeat of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s space program, it's here at the Kennedy Space Center; we thank you for helping us pull off this successful mission,'' Discovery pilot <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> O </PERSON>. <PERSON> Covey </PERSON> told a crowd of several thousand. `` What made our vehicle lift off the launch pad was not the solid fuel booster rockets or the main engines,'' said mission specialist <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>. `` What was pushing us was all your good feelings and the work you put into it.'' Commander <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON> presented the workers with an autograph book which he and his crew carried into orbit. It bears the signatures of more than 15,000 technicians, engineers, managers, clerical and other sdpace center personnel who signed it before the launch. In accepting the book, center director <PERSON> Forrest </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON> said it would `` become a part of the Kennedy Space Center's history.'' <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON> also presented <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON> with a picture montage of three shuttle launchings that included a photograph of the seven Challenger astronauts kiilled when that shuttle exploded on Jan. 28, 1986. <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON>, <PERSON> Covey </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> and the other crew members, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lounge </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilmers </PERSON>, were honored Monday by thousands of people who lined the motorcade route in nearby <LOCATION> Cocoa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, where many of the space workers live. Along the route, which they traveled in convertibles, the astronauts were greeted by high school bands, congratulatory signs, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flags and applause. The ceremonies continue a busy schedule for the space travelers since their four-day flight. They have been honored by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, visited <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and were hailed at celebrations at the <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala </LOCATION>.

 Sales of existing single-family homes fell 2.2 percent in September after an unexpectedly strong sales spurt earlier this year, a real estate trade group said today. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> said sales of existing homes declined to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.63 million units last month, following a 2.2 percent increase in August and a 5.0 percent decline in July. Sales had increased every month from February through June, suprising economists who had predicted that gradually rising interest rates would dampen home buying. However, as it turned out, many buyers apparently bought early in an attempt to beat rising rates. `` The decline ... in September is a hangover from the buying spree of the summer,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON>, chief economist of the real estate group. `` The extraordinary increase'' of the summer was `` in part borrowed from September.'' Fixed-rate mortgages hit a low of 9.84 percent in February and rose to 10.71 percent by early August. Since then, they've eased back to 10.28 percent. <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON> predicted sales rates will continue to lag in the fourth quarter and by year-end would total 3.47 million units, down only slightly from 3.53 million in 1987. The median price of a home fell from August to September by $ 2,900 to $ 88,500, meaning half sold for more and half for less. The decline was a normal seasonal development as the summer home-selling season drew to a close, <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON> said. The Northeast remained the costliest region of the country, with a median sales price of $ 141,400, up 6.3 percent from a year ago. In the West, the median price was $ 124,300, up 7.1 percent from a year earlier. The median in the South was $ 82,400, up 3.6 percent from September 1987. In the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, the price was $ 67,100, up 1.5 percent. The national appreciation rate over 12 months was 3.5 percent. The West was the only region of the country showing an increase of sales last month. They rose 6.0 percent to 710,000 units, following a 3.1 percent increase in August. Sales fell 5.8 percent in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> to 650,000 units, the lowest level since January. They fell 3.2 percent in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> to 900,000 units and were off 2.8 percent in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> to 1.38 million units. <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON> said the sales market is particularly vigorous in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Analysts have attributed the increased activity to fear that local government will impose development controls on building new homes.

 Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> today offered to give up his right to a jury trial on federal perjury charges in order to obtain a verdict by Election Day, but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Vining </PERSON> immediately rejected the idea. With jury selection entering its third day, <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> told <PERSON> Vining </PERSON>, `` I'm just real concerned as to whether or not we can get this case tried this week and next week.'' <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> added, `` I am prepared to waive my right to be tried by a jury. It's not something I want to do.'' Vining would determine a verdict in a non-jury trial, but he said he would not do so in <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s case. He pledged to try to expedite the trial while safeguarding the congressman's rights. `` Mr. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, I understand the importance of the events of Nov. 8 to you,'' <PERSON> Vining </PERSON> said. `` However, I do think there are things more important to you than the election of Nov. 8.'' <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, who contends the perjury charges against him are based on lapses in his memory, cited President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s claims of faulty memory in the Iran-contra affair as he questioned prospective jurors Monday. Acting as his own attorney, <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> asked four of 18 prospective jurors about <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s claim that he could not remember the extent of his knowledge regarding the sale of arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and diversion of some proceeds to Nicaraguan rebels. Two of the prospective jurors seemed sympathetic to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s claim Two others indicated they were skeptical. Twenty more people were to be questioned today by <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, prosecutor <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillen </PERSON> and Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Vining </PERSON>. Selection of the 12-member jury was expected to be completed today. On Monday, <PERSON> Vining </PERSON> granted <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s motion to excuse one potential juror who said he would lean toward the prosecution. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, 38-year-old two-term Republican, said he remained confident the trial can be completed before the Nov. 8 election, in which he faces Democrat <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. After <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s Oct. 17 indictment on 10 counts, he demanded a quick start for his trial because of the election. He is accused of lying to a grand jury, primarily about a meeting he held last year with an undercover <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agent posing as a money broker. The prosecution, which has a tape recording of the meeting, says <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> knew the agent was suggesting that illegal drug proceeds would be used to back an $ 850,000 mortgage for <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s house. The loan was never executed, although <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> did briefly accept a $ 150,000 check from another man involved in the negotiations. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> has said he was tripped up by a `` memory contest'' and never intended to deceive the grand jury. <PERSON> Vining </PERSON> ruled that <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> may put himself on the witness stand without using another attorney to question him. <PERSON> Gillen </PERSON> objected, arguing that <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> would be able to deliver a monologue without giving the government a chance to object to improper questions. But <PERSON> Vining </PERSON> said he did not want to interfere with <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s right to represent himself. Although recent polls show <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> with a 2-1 lead, <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> said he remained confident he can defeat <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> `` as soon as that acquittal happens.'' He said the end of the trial would allow him to contrast his conservative record with what he described as <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' liberal stands.

 Republican front-runner <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today accused Democratic rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of trying to divide Americans along economic lines and exploit `` the base temptations of division, fear and envy.'' Toughening his attack with the election two weeks away, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also scorned <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' economic policies, charging that `` he clings, despite all the evidence of the last two decades, to the discredited policies of high taxes and government spending.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> addressed the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION> as a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> team in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was assigned to deal with <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> charges of lies, distortions and racial bigotry in the vice president's campaign advertising Sen. <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>, R-Pa., <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> Gov <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> and former Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> were detailed to rebut the charges at an afternoon news conference. Speaking with reporters on his <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Two campaign plane, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> referred to the racism charge in connection with a soft-on-crime TV ad used against the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor. `` One of the charges was so vicious and so ugly and so unfounded that I think our people feel they had to respond,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, the vice president was campaigning in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, hoping to bolster his lead in the polls and deny <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> one of the states on his must-win list for the Nov. 8 election. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the broadasters, `` I've been disturbed as I've witnessed my opponent's campaign over the several past weeks at the increasing appeals to class conflict In my view, there is no place in <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public life for philosophies that divide Americans one from another along class lines, and that excite conflict among them.'' Stressing the need for national unity, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> will find her future by keeping with the traditions of her past _ traditions of openness, generosity and cooperation. We will move forward not by succumbing to the base temptations of division, fear and envy but by following, as <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> said, those better angels of our nature.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that under President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, the unemployment rate had dropped from 12.5 percent during the 1981-82 recession to a current 5.9 percent. -LRB- Actually, the all-time high jobless rate was 10.8 percent in November and December of 1982. The current rate is 5.4 percent for September. -RRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> promised that if elected, he will elevate the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> science adviser to assistant to the president and `` make him an active member of the economic policy council and our national security planning processes.'' Moreover, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, he would create a president's council of science and technology advisers composed of leading scientists, engineers and corporate executives. With 23 electoral votes, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> is one of the key battlegrounds in the presidential race. Two recent newspaper polls both gave <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> an 11-point edge over <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in that state. Today marked the vice president's sixth visit to <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> since the GOP National Convention. He accused <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of advocating an industrial policy `` which means having bureaucrats back in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, pick the winners and the losers and that would simply make us all losers.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also chided <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for opposing a reduction in the capital gains tax, saying that everytime it has been cut in the past it has brought in more revenue than it has lost. Campaigning Monday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stressed pocketbook issues and tried to spark a heavy voter turnout for the Republicans. `` Things look pretty good nationally. Things look pretty good but the race is going strong,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told an audience that waited in the rain to see him at a firehouse rally in <LOCATION> Williston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt. </LOCATION>. By the time <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> arrived, the skies had cleared and crowds lined the street, with a sprinkling of protesters `` The undecided voters are goingto make a big difference,'' he said. `` Please do n't let up. Do n't take anything for granted. Get that vote out.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> usually does not respond to charges from <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, but he made an exception to reply to complaints about <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> campaign commercials. `` These guys can dish it out but they ca n't take it ...,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` He wants to run away from his record and I am not going to let him do that.'' `` He can not take it,'' the vice presdent said of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` He can not take it and now he's trying to turn and make the issue what we are saying.'' He said his campaign has `` complete documentation'' for its advertisements assailing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> over a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> prisoner furlough program _ which now has been curtailed _ and on defense issues. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is broadcasting commercials accusing the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign of lying. `` And he is upset, not because it's false, but because he is weak on crime and defense, and that's the inescapable truth,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also denied as `` absolutely ridiculous'' Democratic charges that there is racism in his advertising on the prison furlough program, with its focus on black prisoner <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> who raped a white woman and attacked her fiance. `` I stand fully behind these ads,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> brushed aside questions about <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' charge that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would personally reap a $ 22,000-a-year tax break from his proposal to cut the capital gains tax.

 Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> accused Democratic rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> today of making `` appeals to class conflict'' in charging that a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration would be slanted toward the rich _ including the vice president himself. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who was campaigning today in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, said Monday that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal for a cut in the capital gains tax would benefit the well-to-do and would have meant tax savings to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> personally of about $ 22,000 a year if it had been in effect the past three years. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said today, `` I've been disturbed, as I've witnessed my opponent's campaign of the last several weeks, at the increasing appeals to class conflict. In my view, there is no place in <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public life for philosophies that divide Americans one from another, and that excite conflict among them.'' `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> will find her future by keeping with the traditions of her past, traditions of openness, generosity and cooperation,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` We will move forward not by succumbing to the base temptations of fear and envy but by following as <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> said, those better angels of our nature.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` clings, despite all the evidence of the last two decaes, to the discredited policies of high taxes and government spending.'' His comments came in a speech prepared for the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION>. Polls show <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> leading in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, which is considered a must-win state for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. With two weeks remaining until Election Day, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was seeking votes in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, where the latest poll showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> holding an 11-point lead over the Democratic nominee in the battle for the state's 47 electoral votes. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants to give people like himself a tax break that's more, in some cases, than the average worker in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> makes in a year,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told supporters in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> on Monday. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor also accused the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> ticket of distorting his record in campaign advertising. `` We've seen a campaign of distortions and misrepresentation and of outright lies now for many, many months,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> audience. The Republican nominee, stumping for votes in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, said Monday his campaign has `` complete documentation'' for its commercials criticizing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on crime and defense. `` He can not take it,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` He can not take it and now he's trying to turn and make the issue what we are saying.'' The vice president was campaigning today in the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> cities of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> before flying to <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, was traveling to <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> _ two states expected to end up in the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> column on Nov. 8 _ to help <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> candidates. Democratic vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was campaigning in the <LOCATION> Dakotas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was concentrating on <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> before heading to <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, where he will campaign as well as continue his rounds of television interview programs. The Democratic candidate was appearing on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Nightline'' tonight and also promoting his candidacy in a five-minute spot on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. On Monday night, in an appearance on the `` Larry King'' show on <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was asked whether he had a `` good shot'' of winning the presidency. `` I think we've got a shot,'' he replied. The Democratic nominee conceded that he should have responded to the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> attacks earlier, but said he misunderstood the nature of the campaign and his earlier message was overshadowed by the furor over the <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> selection. `` I was campaigning but a lot of attention was devoted to the -LRB- Republican -RRB- convention, and then there was about three weeks of deafening noise about the Quayle selection, which made it very difficult to get through,'' he said. `` What you find out at the convention is that you're suddenly in a very different world. Who says what for 45 seconds on the 6 o'clock news makes the difference in a particular day, and it took a while to understand that.'' On the campaign trail Monday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said a reduction in the tax on capital gains _ profits gained from sales of property such as stocks or real estate _ would benefit the wealthy, who count <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> among their ranks. `` Consider a taxpayer who reported $ 515,132 in capital gains over the last three years,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` Suppose he reports the same amount over the next three. If the vice president's new plan is accepted, that taxpayer will get an annual tax break of more than $ 22,000. `` And what's the name of that taxpayer? <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' According to aides, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> reported no capital gains during the past three years. The <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, in today's editions, showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> leading <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> 53 percent to 42 percent. The poll of 1,376 registered voters was conducted Thursday through Sunday and had a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, meanwhile, also stressed economic concerns as he campaigned in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. The vice president said the Republicans have built an economic revival so strong that it `` can withstand any emergency _ with the possible exception of a liberal Democrat in the White House.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also cautioned voters against taking the election for granted. `` The undecided voters are going to make a big difference,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` Please do n't let up. Do n't take anything for granted. Get that vote out.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, campaigning in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, echoed his running mate in urging voters to cast their ballots on Election Day, and also suggested that the Democrats `` are grasping at any straw'' in criticizing the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> ticket. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, addressing a rally at a Baptist church in <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, charged that the Republicans `` are bearing false witness against <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.'' `` And we're going to set that record straight,'' he said.

 Police arrested 30 people today for questioning in a fire that destroyed a movie theater showing `` The Last Temptation of Christ'' and injured 13 people. Police said the arrests came in raids aimed at extremist right-wing groups, but would not indicate what their searches had disclosed. Authorities said the fire late Saturday was set. Several hundred people, including political and film personalities, demonstrated Monday night in front of the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michel </LOCATION> theater in the Latin Quarter. The theater earlier had been the scene of protests against the film directed by American <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scorsese </PERSON>.

 A firefighter digging through the rubble of a six-story building found the last survivor when she grabbed his hand more than eight hours after the structure collapsed. `` I'm <PERSON> Robin </PERSON>! Get me out!'' shouted <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON> to rescuers at the office building in the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s Garment District. <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>, 27, was in serious but stable condition at <LOCATION> Bellevue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> this morning after undergoing leg surgery. The owner of the building was killed, and <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON> and 11 others were injured. <PERSON> Khoder </PERSON> <PERSON> Alsouleh </PERSON>, 25, and his brother <PERSON> Sami </PERSON>, both of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, were reported in serious condition today at <LOCATION> Bellvue </LOCATION>. Everbody who was inside the 60-year-old building when it collapsed Monday, including a pregnant woman who survived from the top floor, was accounted for by late Monday, authorities said. `` It was like riding a monster, and the only thing you could do was to hang on,'' said <PERSON> Wilhelm </PERSON> <PERSON> Waight </PERSON>, a 32-year-old delivery man who survived a fall from the fifth floor with only minor injuries. `` I covered my face with my arms.'' He said he hit a van in a parking lot, then freed himself from the rubble. The collapse two blocks south of the Empire State Building crippled transit service just before evening rush hour, affecting hundreds of thousands of commuters. Subways to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and the west side of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> and trains to <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> were halted more than an hour. Rescuers were worried vibrations from the trains would cause more of the building to collapse, hampering rescue efforts. Authorities did not know for certain what caused the building's west wall and interior to cave in, but <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Efrain </PERSON> <PERSON> Parrilla </PERSON> said a trench had been dug along a wall Buildings Commissioner <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said construction work had been going on at the building, but that no permits had been issued. `` It appears they undermined the wall of this building and it collapsed,'' he said. <PERSON> Shelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 26, who is five months pregnant, works for a jeweler on the building's top floor. When it collapsed, she slid down with the debris and emerged with cuts and bruises. `` It just collapsed,'' she said. `` I hung onto the floor, I guess. The building fell into the parking lot. I crawled out.'' `` It made a sound like a swoosh,'' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Burgos </PERSON>, who watched from his store across the street. `` I watched the top floors crumble. As they fell, men were actually coming out of the side of the walls, climbing down the debris. It looked like they did n't have a choice. <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>, who works for a handbag manufacturer on the sixth floor, was found buried in packaging and cardboard boxes, which probably cushioned her from the falling rubble, said <PERSON> Homer </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON>, chief of operations for the <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Firefighter <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodges </PERSON> began digging in the area when he saw some boxes move. About 20 minutes later, <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON> was pulled out. She was crying, said <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON>, `` and so was I.'' Earlier, rescuers found the body of <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> DeSantis </PERSON>, 64, owner of the building. <PERSON> DeSantis </PERSON> had been last seen on the roof a few minutes before the 3 p.m. collapse, said Police Chief <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. Rescuers crawling through the rubble used listening and infrared heat-sensing devices in their search for survivors. At midnight, officials believed that everyone had been accounted for, said <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON>.

 Brooklyn-born Rabbi <PERSON> Meir </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON>, the anti-Arab militant who renounced his <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizenship to run for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s parliament, said today he wants to be an American citizen again <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON> said he planned to fly to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Wednesday for a fund-raising tour, but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said his passport was no longer valid and he would not be able to use it to gain entry. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON> formally renounced his citizenship Sept. 16, and on Oct. 7 the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> approved the certificate of loss of nationality. On Oct. 18, <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON> appeared before a consular officer in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and asked to reverse the move, said the embassy spokesman, who requested anonymity. `` We are informing him that the renunciation ca n't be reversed but that there is a procedure for appeal,'' said the spokesman. He said <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON> has one year to submit an appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appellate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION>. He can also appeal in federal court. <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON>, who founded the militant <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said in a telephone interview that he `` was forced'' to give up his <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizenship by a new amendment to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> law that bars dual nationals from running for <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION>, or parliament. On Oct. 5, the <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> issued a decision barring <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON>'s anti-Arab Kach party, which polls indicated might win three or more seats in the Nov. 1 election for the 120-seat parliament. On Oct. 18, the <ORGANIZATION> Israeli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> upheld by a unanimous 5-0 vote the exclusion of Kach on grounds the party was racist. <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON> advocates the expulsion of all Arabs from Israeli-held territory. After the court decision, <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON> said he immediately notified the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consulate </ORGANIZATION> that he wanted to withdraw his renunciation. `` It was conditioned clearly in my application on my <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION> list being approved,'' said <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON> claimed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> governments had a `` common interest'' in barring him from making a speaking tour in which he would condemn <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s banning of his Kach party. <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON>, who immigrated to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 1971, was elected to the <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION> in 1984. <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON>, who has been barred from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, said that without <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizenship he might be refused a visa to travel to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In refusing him entry, Canadian officials cited <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON>'s July 23, 1971, conviction in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for possession of explosives, bombs and other weapons. <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON> served one year of a five-year term in that case. <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON> also has served several jail terms in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, including a one-year administrative detention without trial and three months for defying an army order barring him from a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town. Both were related to attempts to establish Jewish settlements.

 Police used tear gas and clubs today against activists supporting a boycott of Wednesday's nationwide elections for segregated municipal councils Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> called for an Election Day fast and appealed to all sides to avoid violence. A bomb exploded today in <LOCATION> Potchefstroom </LOCATION>, southwest of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, extensively damaging a shopping center and slightly injuring a policeman, police headquarters said. It was the second bombing in as many days and police said the attacks are part of a campaign by the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> black guerrilla movement to disrupt the elections. On Monday, a car bombing in <LOCATION> Witbank </LOCATION>, east of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, killed two people and injured 42. In Zwide, near <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elizabeth </LOCATION>, a black candidate was shot and killed at his home late Monday by an unidentified assailant, a local newspaper reported. Near <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, more than 30 mixed-race high school students were injured today in a clash with club-wielding police after they protested the elections, a school official said. At <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witwatersrand </ORGANIZATION>, more than 1,000 people staged an anti-election rally. Many of them, including black activist <PERSON> Winnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, marched to a campus gate where riot police ordered them to disperse, then fired tear gas. Police said officers were being deployed throughout the country to guard polling stations. The <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, a group opposing apartheid, said in a report today that the elections `` are taking place under a blanket of silence generated by the repression of anti-apartheid activists.'' The commission said about 300 activists had been detained without charge since Sept. 1, most of them in connection with the election campaign. The commission also alleged that authorities were coercing large numbers of blacks into voting. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said those who wish to vote, as well as those who boycott, `` should be free to exercise their choice without intimidation. `` I want to make an urgent call for a peaceful response to the elections,'' the Anglican archbiship said in a statement from church headquarters in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. `` I call on the government not to provoke violence during the polling and on all those involved in responding to the elections, whether supporting or opposing them, not to allow intimidation,'' he said. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, along with other black anti-apartheid leaders, have been calling for a national day of protest and a boycott of the ballotting for segregated municipal councils. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984, called for fasting and prayer but said the he and other anti-apartheid leaders were not necessarily calling for a general strike. Since a state of emergency was declared in 1986, it has been illegal to call for nationwide strikes. The elections mark the first time South Africans of all races vote at the same time. The white minority government has spent millions of dollars on advertising to encourage a high black turnout, seeking support for its claims that it is extending democracy to blacks even though it denies them a vote in national elections. There are about 5 million whites and 26 million blacks in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Roughly half the blacks live in self-governing homelands not involved in the local elections. Critics say black turnout figures this year will be virtually meaningless because millions of blacks are ineligible to vote and because no candidates linked to major anti-apartheid groups are running. Many opposition groups are banned, and most activists view black town councils as subservient extensions of the white-controlled central government. In the white elections, attention is focused on a showdown between President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the far-right <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which seeks to strengthen segregation laws. White anti-apartheid candidates are active in only a few cities. Their most important battleground is <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, where they are underdogs against the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in a fight for control of the city council.

<TEXT>
 Police said today the photograph of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> hostage <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> that was found in the bag of a Lebanese woman appears to be a copy and not an original. They said they were still examining a photograph of American hostage <PERSON> Alann </PERSON> <PERSON> Steen </PERSON>, a photograph of an unidentified man and several documents, including a letter bearing <PERSON> Steen </PERSON>'s name. The photos and documents were discovered in the woman's luggage when she arrived in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Achille </PERSON> <PERSON> Serra </PERSON>, head of the anti-terrorism unit of <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> police, told reporters police had to check further before determining whether the photos and letter were part of an effort to free <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, or part of some sort of swindle. `` It depends a lot on -LRB- <PERSON> Steen </PERSON>'s -RRB- handwriting,'' <PERSON> Serra </PERSON> said. `` If the handwriting -LRB- sample -RRB-.. shows that this letter was n't written by <PERSON> Steen </PERSON>, things change a lot We would be talking about a fraud.'' He would not say who might have been the object of a possible swindle. Police were awaiting a handwriting sample from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The photo of <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, the longest-held of the foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, appeared similar _ in reverse image _ to one issued by the pro-Iranian group Islamic Jihad in August. <PERSON> Serra </PERSON> said he had not seen the earlier photo, but `` I believe, at least for the time being, you can say that it -LRB- the photo -RRB- was not taken of the person himself, it's a photo of a photo.'' According to police, the Lebanese woman was to turn the photos and documents over to <PERSON> Aldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Anghessa </PERSON>, an Italian arms trader with links to Swiss and Italian intelligence agencies. The woman, identified as <PERSON> Aline </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Rizkallah </PERSON>, 36, said she was to receive about $ 4,000 from <LOCATION> Anghessa </LOCATION>, but the Italian has denied it, police said. She was arrested Thursday after arriving in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Serra </PERSON> refused to speculate Tuesday about who was to ultimately receive the photos and letter. `` We have our suspicions about the destination, but I guarantee you on my word of honor that we do n't know who was to get it,'' he told a news conference He refused comment on a suggestion he made Monday that an American organization was the intended destination. <PERSON> Serra </PERSON> said police had identified the man who supplied the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> woman with photographs, documents, 1.7 ounces of heroin and $ 1,000 in counterfeit <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bills. Italian police were considering traveling to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to question the man, he said. It was unclear why the woman would endanger herself by carrying small amounts of fake money and heroin. She was jailed for possessing them. <PERSON> Anghessa </PERSON> was not charged because there was no proof the drugs or money were destined for him, police said. Islamic Jihad denied Monday that it was connected with the woman. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, was seized on March 16, 1985. <PERSON> Steen </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, was kidnapped Jan. 24, 1987 at <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, where he taught.

<HEAD>Lawyer Ordered to Pay $400,000 in Damages in Amnesty Scam</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A lawyer accused of taking fees from more than 400 aliens seeking legalization, and then failing to file their federal amnesty applications, has been ordered to pay nearly $ 400,000 in damages. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Triwush </PERSON>, whose law license was suspended by the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year, was ordered Monday by Circuit Judge <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Scotillo </PERSON> to pay a total of $ 395,568 in damages to 417 aliens and 11 employers. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>, the lawyers now representing the aliens, said <PERSON> Triwush </PERSON> took fees ranging from $ 40 to $ 850 from aliens and employers last year, but did not file applications in the amnesty program granting legal residency for those who had lived continuously in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since 1982. The deadline for applications was May 1. During the six months that he was accepting fees, <PERSON> Triwush </PERSON> continued to work although the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> suspended his license for his failure to file a brief in an unrelated case, officials said. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> later ordered Triwush jailed for 30 days, but suspended the sentence after he agreed to make restitution of $ 90,000 to the aliens and employers, representing the amount of fees accepted during the six-month suspension. He was ordered to appear Nov. 15 to explain he should not be held in contempt. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> could reimpose the jail sentence at that time. None of the $ 90,000 had been repaid, <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> said. Scotillo imposed the judgment Monday after <PERSON> Triwush </PERSON> failed to comply with requests for information from <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>. <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> said <PERSON> Triwush </PERSON> also pleaded guilty to theft in <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Circuit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION> for accepting fees from aliens but failing to file any documents. <PERSON> Triwush </PERSON> was placed on 30 months' probation and ordered to make resitution in that case, officials said.

 Tropical Storm <PERSON> Miriam </PERSON> turned away from the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> coast after heavy rains cut short a cycling race in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and sent children home from school early in southern <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and southern <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, barely affected by the storm that left at least 111 dead in five other Latin American countries, called off states of alert that had been in effect Sunday and Monday. As Hurricane <PERSON> Joan </PERSON>, the storm killed 21 people in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, four in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, 25 in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and 11 in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. It also claimed 50 lives in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> as it tore from the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> before being downgraded to a tropical storm and renamed <PERSON> Miriam </PERSON>. The storm affected all Central American countries except tiny <LOCATION> Belize </LOCATION> and left hundreds of thousands of people homeless. Forecasters had feared it would regain strength and become a hurricane again as it reached the warm waters of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, but it did not. At 11 a.m. EDT, <PERSON> Miriam </PERSON>'s center was near latitude 14.8 north, longitude 94.2 west, or about 75 miles off the coast of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tehuantepec </LOCATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hurricane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. The center said the storm had maximum sustained winds of near 50 mph and was expected today to resume heading west northwest at about nine mph. A storm becomes a hurricane when maximum sustained winds reach 74 mph. Flash flood and mud slide warnings remained in effect today for <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. About 1,500 people living near coastal rivers in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> were evacuated Monday. The airport opened Monday morning after being closed Sunday. In <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, bicyclists competing in the rain during the fifth day of a two-week cycling tour were excused from 10 miles of the race because of the rain. Despite light flooding in southern <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, officials said evacuations were not necessary. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> suffered the most from Hurricane <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> as it lashed the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> coast and then ripped its way over land to the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. The Nicaraguan government said about 300,000 people were homeless and at least 40 people were missing. <LOCATION> Bluefields </LOCATION>, a Nicaraguan port city on the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> with a population of 38,000, was in tatters with at least 6,000 homes destroyed and few buildings still with roofs. Officials said at least 21 people were killed in <LOCATION> Bluefields </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, the storm toppled electrical towers and tore down telephone lines and trees. Many people living beside riverbeds lost their homes. Much of the Nicaraguan capital remained without electric power or drinking water Monday and the government ordered schools to remain closed so schoolchildren could help with reconstruction work. In an interview broadcast on state radio Monday, Agrarian Reform Minister <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheelock </PERSON> said floods and strong winds caused the heavy damage to three basic foods _ rice, beans and bananas _ and also affected export crops such as coffee, cotton and sugar cane. The storm destroyed almost all 2,470 acres of coconut palms and 80 percent of the African palm plantations in southern <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and 40 percent of the banana plantations, he said. The first relief flights arrived in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bluefields </LOCATION> on Sunday, carrying doctors, food and medicine from <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. The Mexican government flew in relief supplies Monday, Mexican television said. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> claimed President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> was using the storm tragedy as propaganda against the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's support of rebels fighting the country's leftist Sandinista government. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said no request for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid had been received from the Nicaraguan government and none was expected. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> appealed for international aid but <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said `` the best humanitarian the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could give us would be to stop its terrorist policies against <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' The Nicaraguan government estimates that the 7-year-old war with the rightist rebels, known as Contras, has inflicted $ 12 billion worth of damage on the country.

 <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, whose death last year became a symbol of child abuse in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, was viciously beaten by the only father she ever knew, a prosecutor charged this morning as the murder trial of <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> began. <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> died on Nov. 5 when she was removed from a respirator, but `` she was really killed days earlier,'' Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Casolaro </PERSON> told the jury. `` <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> beat <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> so severely that he inflicted those injures which caused her death.'' <PERSON> Casolaro </PERSON> told the panel that `` graphic and grotesque'' evidence and testimony will prove <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> murdered the child. Six-year-old <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> was found unconscious in the <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> apartment early Nov. 2, 1987, and died of her injuries three days later. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, a disbarred lawyer who took the child illegally at birth from an unwed <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> teen-ager, is charged with second-degree murder. Defense attorney <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> London </PERSON> said the evidence would not support the prosecution's claim. `` It will not be proven in this case that <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> was murdered, nor will it be prove that <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> was a battered child,'' <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said in a brief opening in which he also attacked <PERSON> Hedda </PERSON> <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s longtime live-in companion and an anticipated key prosecution witness. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> called Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> `` delusional,'' mentioned she had spent the last year in a mental hospital and alluded to her `` romance with Satanic cults.'' Following the opening statement, a paramedic who arrived at the <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> home to find <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> unconcious and her brother <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> tethered to a playpen took the stand as the trial's first witness. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> denies ever hitting <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>; he claims she was sickened by food, and the bruises on her back and chest resulted from his trying to revive her after she fell unconscious the night of Nov. 1, 1987. Justice <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothwax </PERSON> ruled Monday that prosecutors may tell jurors that Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, 46, waited at least 10 hours before she called for help for the comatose child because she was terrified of <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>. No help was called for <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> until after 6:30 a.m. on Nov. 2, court records show. When police and medical technicians arrived, they found the girl unconscious and a 16-month-old boy, called <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, tethered to his playpen, lying in a soiled diaper and drinking spoiled milk. <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> was pronounced brain dead at nearby <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vincent </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> at 8:55 a.m. on Nov. 5. The six men and six women who will hear the case, which is expected to last four to eight weeks, will likely hear testimony about child abuse, beatings, drug abuse, sadomasochism and illegal adoptions. Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> was charged along with <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> in <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'s death, but never indicted. After her arrest, she underwent surgery and psychiatric treatment for injuries allegedly inflicted by <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>. The prosecution has said all charges against her probably will be dropped.

<HEAD>Nancy Reagan Urges Arrest Of Wall Street Cocaine Users</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 First lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> today called for a home front war on individual drug users and said authorities should arrest Wall Street bankers buying cocaine during lunch. It is as important to stop drug use in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, she said, as it is to top cocoa growing in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, processing in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and shipping through the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. `` It is often easier to make strong speeches about foreign drug lords or drug smugglers,'' she said, `` than to arrest a pair of Wall Street investment bankers buying cocaine on their lunch break.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who often has campaigned against drug use during her husband's presidency, called for a new crusade against drug use at home during a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Third Committee on Social and Humanitarian affairs. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has emphasized interdiction and stopping illegal drugs from entering the country, especially from <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. But Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the battle also must be fought at home. `` The drug user is an accomplice to every criminal act, every murder, every terrotist attack carried out by the narcotics syndicates,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who wore a mulberry-colored dress and heavy golden jewelry. `` If we lack the will to fully mobilize the forces of law in our own country to arrest and punish drug users, if we can not stem the American demand for drugs,'' she said, `` then there will be little hope of preventing foreign drug producers from fulfilling that demand ... Drugs must remain illegal at every step in the chain.'' She was accompanied by Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>. She earlier met Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the international efforts against drugs are of vital importance and must be expanded. `` Drug traffickers are international criminals who deserve no rest or sanctuary,'' she said. But she emphasized that `` it is the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> alone which bears responsibility for its own drug problem. I am not blaming other nations for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s drug problem. While most of the illegal drugs are imported, the drug users are home-grown.'' To get serious about stopping illegal drugs, she said, `` there can be no substitute for focusing on the user and that means confronting all those citizens who use drugs.'' `` We need to educate a generation to `` Just Say, ` No','' to drugs,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` And in the meantime, we must continue our fight against the production, processing, financing, importation, sale and use of illegal drugs.''

<TEXT>
 If you've ever been robbed, says Rep. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Swift </PERSON>, you know how some <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> voters felt in the last two presidential elections when TV networks declared a winner hours before their polls closed. `` When people are told the election is over before they've even voted, it tends to convey that their vote does n't count,'' said <PERSON> Swift </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state Democrat. `` It's like being robbed _ a combination of feeling violated and helpless,'' he said. `` You're angry, but you do n't know who to hit.'' For eight years, <PERSON> Swift </PERSON> and other Western politicians have looked for someone to hit, as they try to put a little suspense back into election night for their constituents. But their battle against the `` time zone factor'' has been frustrated by congressional inaction, court challenges and lack of firm evidence that election-night projections of winners do any real harm. Despite their crusade, election coverage on network television Nov. 8 promises to differ little from 1980 or 1984, analysts say, and it may even bring news of the winner _ <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> _ in record time. Projections of presidential winners have been made since the 1964 Goldwater-Johnson race. They are based on exit polls, in which voters leaving a balloting place are asked at random how they voted and why. Personal information such as age and sex also is recorded. The polls and projections have grown steadily in speed and accuracy. In 1980, when <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> scored his unexpected landslide over President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> declared <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> the winner at 5:15 p.m. Pacific time, or 8:15 pm. on the East Coast.

The 1980 projections infuriated many Western politicans and voters. Election observers reported seeing prospective voters step out of line after learning of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s apparent victory. Democratic leaders in the West complained that <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s early concession hurt their efforts to get voters to the polls in close local races. But network executives argued, then and now, that giving the early word to Western voters is unavoidable in a country spread across four time zones, or six if <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> are counted. `` It may be unpalatable for voters in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, but it would be unprofessional to have knowledge that we know to be true and not give it,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegenthaler </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> vice president for news operations. Legislators in many states rejected that argument and sought to restrict exit polling on the ground that its results intimidate voters. Nearly half the states have enacted restrictions limiting how close exit pollsters may work near balloting areas, said <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, a network attorney.

With the networks' limited promise in hand, <PERSON> Swift </PERSON> urged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to take the next step by ordering all polling booths closed at 9 p.m. Eastern time. In the West, that would be achieved by extending Daylight Savings Time by two weeks each election year and closing polls at 7 p.m. local time. <PERSON> Swift </PERSON>'s bill has passed the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> twice but died in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. He said he does n't know if he'll try again. Critics of <PERSON> Swift </PERSON>'s proposal say that while election-night projections might spoil the surprise for Western voters, studies have failed to show that they discourage significant numbers of people from voting. <PERSON> Swift </PERSON> concedes the lack of such evidence but argues that Westerners may grow disillusioned even though they vote.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> today signed legislation creating the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, telling vets they deserve `` a seat at the table of our national affairs.'' In signing into law the bill establishing the 14th Cabinet-level agency, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> made an election-year exception to his oft-stated opposition to expanding the size of federal government. At the conclusion of a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> at </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McNair </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, the president said that the nation's debt to its military men and women `` does not end the day the uniform comes off.'' `` All of those who have served in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s uniform deserve the nation's thanks,'' he said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> noted that the legislation has been in the works for 13 years, and said that `` it's something that I've been looking forward to for a long, long time.'' `` This bill gives those who have borne <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s battles, who defended the borders of freedom, who protected our nation's security in war and peace, it gives them what they have deserved for so long _ a seat at the table of our national affairs,'' he told a crowd that included <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>; Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, and congressional sponsors of the bill `` I like to think that this bill gives Cabinet rank not just to an agency of government, but to every single veteran,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` Welcome aboard!'' Throughout his political career, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has railed against `` big government'' in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. He has used numerous speeches during the current presidential campaign to warn that Democrats would return the nation to the era of `` Big Brother'' and `` Big Government.'' But neither <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> nor Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> showed any such qualms this year about the bill creating a new Department of Veterans Affairs, the 14th Cabinet-level agency and one devoted to pursuing the interests of a select group of individuals. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> also paid election-year homage to the nation's 27 million veterans, with both chambers giving easy approval to the bill earlier this fall. In approving the change, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rejected arguments that setting up the new department would lead ultimately to increased spending and admonitions that it was engaging in an election-year ploy. Supporters of the legislation argued that the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> already has the fifth-largest budget among federal agencies and merits being put on par with other Cabinet departments. The <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> serves 27 million veterans and 49 million dependents or survivors with a budget of $ 30 billion. It will dispense $ 14 billion in income maintenance and $ 626 million for education and rehabilitation assistance this year. On Monday, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed legislation with little fanfare authorizing the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> to close <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military installations considered unnecessary. The president gave that politically sensitive issue a much lower profile, with his signature of the bill noted only in a White House press release. That bill has the potential of saving the government up to $ 5 billion a year as <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials pare down the list of 3,800 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military installations. It sets up a complicated base-closing procedure which essentially cuts through a thicket of laws enacted by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in the past decade to thwart <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> efforts to shut down bases.

White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk pointed out that the presidential action comes not only in the wake of the July explusions, but also in light of further restrictions placed on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. `` We've been trying to get our people replaced, and we have n't gotten anywhere,'' <PERSON> Popadiuk </PERSON> said He noted that on Sept. 22, the Sandinista government required that American diplomats based in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> who leave the country, for whatever reason, must wait three weeks before they are allowed to re-enter <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. At the time, the administration said it would take some type of retaliatory action, but did not state what it would be. Diplomats already posted to the Nicaraguan embassy in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> are unaffected by the proclamation. Officials assigned now or in the future to the Nicaraguan <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mission in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> or the mission to the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> are also unaffected.

 Millionaire businessman <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> won <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> primary in the face of charges he was buying the election with personal wealth _ a far cry from the penny-pinching campaigns of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, the man he hopes to succeed. In the most recent general election polling, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> also has been leading the Republican nominee, state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Engeleiter </PERSON>. But <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> officials say she still can win, and an appearance by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on her behalf has been promised before the election. <PERSON> Engeleiter </PERSON>, 36, of <LOCATION> Brookfield </LOCATION>, would be the first woman <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> has sent to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. She also would be the younger than any current member of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Whoever wins, the battle has ended a tradition of low-cost campaigns that <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> established in his 31 years in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The retirement of <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, who will turn 73 three days after the election, also ends an era of statewide, personal campaigning that spurned the use of paid advertising. <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, often focused on issues of what he saw as government waste during his long political career. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, 53, of <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, already has set a record for election spending in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, contributing $ 3.84 million of his own money to his first try at public office. His campaign had raised $ 4.28 million in all through Sept. 30. <PERSON> Engeleiter </PERSON> had raised $ 1.33 million. <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> reported spending just $ 145.10 to win re-election in 1982, down from $ 177.25 in 1976. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s personal wealth and his many personal business dealings have become an issue in the campaign. He had an income of $ 4.2 million last year, according to his accountant. <PERSON> Engeleiter </PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON>, reported an income of $ 130,000. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s Democratic primary election opponents tried to persuade voters he was buying the election. And <PERSON> Engeleiter </PERSON> has portrayed herself as a middle-class candidate in the state's political mainstream, a `` <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> original.'' But <PERSON> Engeleiter </PERSON>'s family income is above average for <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> lives relatively simply, eating breakfast most mornings at a working-class diner in his <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> neighborhood. He has refused political action committee donations and campaigned on the theme `` Nobody's senator but yours.'' In one well-publicized campaign controversy, <PERSON> Engeleiter </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> owned a controlling interest in a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, bakery that did most of its business with the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said he began selling <ORGANIZATION> Sterling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bakery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> when he decided to run for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, and completed the sale in September. The issue backfired on <PERSON> Engeleiter </PERSON> when she hinted <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> had overcharged the Pentagon for coffee cake. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> showed the price per pound was lower than the charges for a similar cake at the supermarket that bears his family name. He is the former owner of a chain of supermarkets and department stores. In 1985, after he sold the stores, he spent $ 18.5 million to acquire the <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bucks </ORGANIZATION> professional basketball team. <PERSON> Engeleiter </PERSON> contends <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> should make more complete financial disclosure, but interviews and polls indicate the issue has had little effect on voters. `` There are basic issues beneath the surface, but the dynamics seem to be personal,'' said <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> history professor <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogue </PERSON>. State Historian <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> suggests that voters seem to be turned off this election, another departure from the past. `` <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> traditionally has taken politics seriously, as opposed to cynically,'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> led <PERSON> Engeleiter </PERSON> 57 percent to 34 percent among likely voters surveyed Oct. 6 and Oct. 7 by the <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, but Republican strategists still contend <PERSON> Engeleiter </PERSON> could prevail. `` This is a very winnable race,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wyo </LOCATION>., who came to <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> to campaign for <PERSON> Engeleiter </PERSON> last week Still, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s forces seem comfortable with their lead, and other Democrats are counting on <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s coattails to help retain their majorities in the Legislature. <PERSON> Engeleiter </PERSON> tends to support the national Republican ticket and party platform on defense and budget issues but is more liberal on social issues. She supports a woman's right to choose abortion, while the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> platform opposes abortion. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> has called for sharp cuts in defense spending, but supports continued research, although not deployment, of the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION>, known as `` Star Wars.'' He favors increased spending for social programs, including education. Past holders of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat are a varied lot, including Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, censured by colleagues in the 1950s, and Sens. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Follette </PERSON>, father and son, both of whom clashed with the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> establishment and played prominent roles in the Progressive movement.

<HEAD>FDA Approves New Drug For Treatment of Cancer-Related Diarrhea</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Food and <ORGANIZATION> Drugs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday approved a new drug for controlling a type of diarrhea that often kills patients with intestinal cancer. <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said the new drug, called octreotide acetate, `` can dramatically improve the life'' of patients with malignant carcinoid tumors and vasoactive intestinal peptide-secreting tumors. These cancers grow slowly and often are not diagnosed until after they have spread and become inoperable. The malignancies themselves often are not fatal for up to 20 years, but they cause a severe and frequent diarrhea that can cripple and even kill. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said the new drug will permit many patients with the intestinal cancer to live normal lives `` rather than be weakened and continually hospitalized.'' `` For many, it will reduce or eliminate the frequent and devastating bouts of diarrhea that often require repeated hospitalizations for intravenous fluid replacement therapy,'' he said. About one or two people per million in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> develop the intestinal cancer annually. The cancer often goes undiagnosed for seven or eight years. Though patients can live with the cancer for years, it causes heavy secretions of peptides, a type of protein which triggers severe and unrelenting diarrhea, along with wheezing, heart problems and loss of energy. The new drug does not attack the cancer, but controls secretion of the peptides. The drug mimics the action of somatostatine, a naturally occurring hormone that regulates secretions by the organs in the body, and prevents excess release of the peptides. This, in turn, eliminates the cause of the diarrhea. Officials said the drug is administered by injection. It was developed in the <ORGANIZATION> Sandoz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> laboratories in <LOCATION> Basel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, and approved by the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> after major clinical trials in this country. It will be marketed under the name <PERSON> Sandostatin </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said that since some patients on the drug developed gallstones, ultrasonic monitoring of patients is recommended.

<HEAD>Bitter Battle Over Gay Rights Measure in Colorado City</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT COLLINS, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A proposed amendment to the city charter that would ban discrimination against homosexuals has pitted conservative clergymen against a coalition of advocates for civil liberties and gay rights. The proposal on the Nov. 8 ballot would prohibit discrimination in jobs, housing or public accommodations because of sexual orientation. `` We believe discrimination is fundamentally wrong. It goes against the health and well-being of our entire community,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, a proponent of the amendment, said in a statement. Opponents argue that anti-discrimination laws should not apply to homosexuality because it is a chosen lifestyle. Others have called homosexuality a `` perversion'' and have prominently mentioned acquired immune deficiency syndrome, for which sexually active gay men are at high risk. One minister who opposes the measure has threatened to go on radio and television if the amendment is approved and declare that the northern <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> city is the place for homosexuals to be. The Rev. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> said his congregation, the <ORGANIZATION> LaPorte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION>, has pledged to spend $ 4,000 to defeat the amendment. Last week, he began criticizing the proposal in a series of paid, two-hour radio broadcasts on a local station that prompted a flurry of angry calls from listeners. He also plans to buy time on a local cable television. `` I'm going to go on my program and let the homosexuals around the nation know that <PERSON> Fort </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> is the place to come to'' if the amendment is passed, said <PERSON> Peters </PERSON>. Other clergymen, however, have spoken out in favor of the proposal. Its supporters are conducting a low-key, door-to-door campaign and have focused on collecting endorsements from groups such as the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> for Women.

 Discovery's astronauts returned to the scene of last month's first post-Challenger shuttle launch Tuesday to thank space workers and praise them as the `` heartbeat of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s space program.'' `` What made the vehicle lift off the launch pad was not the solid fuel booster rockets or the main engines; what was pushing us was all your good feelings and the work and dedication and care you put into it,'' astronaut <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> told a crowd of several thousand people assembled in a parking lot near the launch control center. `` If there's a heartbeat of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s space program, it's here at the Kennedy Space Center,'' said Discovery pilot <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> O </PERSON>. <PERSON> Covey </PERSON>. `` We congratulate you for the role you played in helping us pull off this very successful mission.'' <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON>, Discovery's commander, presented the workers with an autograph book which he and his crew carried into orbit. It contains the signatures of more than 15,000 technicians, engineers, managers, clerical and other space center staffers who signed it before launch. In accepting the book, center director <PERSON> Forrest </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON> said it would be displayed prominently and `` become part of the Kennedy Space Center's history.'' <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON> also presented <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON> with a picture montage that included shuttle launchings and a photograph of the seven astronauts killed when the Challenger exploded Jan. 28, 1986. <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON> presented all five astronauts with a framed picture of Discovery's liftoff Looking ahead to the next flight, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> pointed to the huge Vehicle Assembly Building across the street and noted that <PERSON> Atlantis </PERSON> was in there being prepared for a late November liftoff, with a five-man crew commanded by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> `` Hoot'' <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>. `` In this building behind me is Hoot's rocket,'' he said. `` Please get Hoot off the planet for awhile.''

<HEAD>Harrah's Reno Employees Suspended For Refusing to Wear Anti-Drug
Ribbon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RENO, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Several <PERSON> Harrah </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> employees have been suspended without pay for just saying no to management's order to wear a ribbon at work proclaiming themselves `` drug free.'' <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON>, general manager of the club, said five or six employees were suspended Sunday and Monday, although some workers claim the number is closer to a dozen. The suspensions came because the red ribbons saying `` The choice for me, Drug Free!'' were made part of the resort's dress, and the employees were out of uniform by refusing to wear the ribbons, <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> said Monday. But attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Houston </PERSON>, who represents four of the suspended workers, said <PERSON> Harrah </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> violated the employees' First Amendment rights by forcing them to wear what amounts to a statement about drugs. `` The issue is: When does the casino recognize the right of expression of its own employees ... not to adopt the position of the employer?'' <PERSON> Houston </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Houston </PERSON> said he was attempting to negotiate with the casino but might file suit. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON>, general counsel for <ORGANIZATION> Harrah </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reno </ORGANIZATION>, said the suspended employees will have to go through an internal grievance proceeding to be reinstated. More than 50,000 ribbons were distributed to schools, government agencies and businesses in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> by the Governor's Alliance for a Drug Free <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> in observance of National Drug Free America Week, which began Sunday. The suspended employees, who did not want to be named for fear of recrimination, said they did not refuse to wear the ribbons because they use illegal drugs. Instead, many said they consume alcoholic drinks and coffee and smoke cigarettes so it would have been hypocritical to say they were drug free. <PERSON> Harrah </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> made the ribbon wearing voluntary Monday afternoon after officials said they ran out of ribbons.

<TEXT>
 The suicides of 14 Cobb County teen-agers in a 25-month period has triggered a study on teen suicide by the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> and the county health department. Dr. <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Mork </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Cobb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, said the goal of the effort is to produce the first detailed study of suicide based on interviews with those who survive attempts to kill themselves. `` We've got this glaring problem of people killing themselves. We want to know why,'' she said. `` Who are they? What are they like? Are their parents middle-class? How old are they? If they are in school, what school do they go to? What method do they choose?'' The study, now encompassing 441 case studies of all ages, indicates at least 900 people may attempt suicide in <LOCATION> Cobb </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> every year. The county, which borders northwest <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, has about 300,000 residents. Fourteen adolescents 19 or younger killed themselves in <LOCATION> Cobb </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> from September 1986 to October 1988. The county's suicide rate _ 14.7 deaths for every 100,000 people _ is almost three deaths higher than the state average and almost two higher than the national average. Dr. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Carroll </PERSON> of the Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Cobb </ORGANIZATION> study may offer insights into the rising number of suicides. Researchers eventually want to study 1,000 cases. Interviews with 441 patients between October 1987 and October 1988 show: _ Only 38 of the 441 who attempted suicide took precautions to avoid rescue, a much smaller proportion than those who succeed in committing suicide _ More than 240 of the 441 took drug overdoses, while few who succeed in committing suicide take drugs Most use guns or hang themselves. _ More than 60 percent were women, but women constituted only one-third of those who succeed _ About 254 of the 441 expressed an intent to commit suicide, either in a note or conversation According to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>, suicide rates are climbing for teens and adults. The overall national rate has risen from 11.9 suicides for every 100,000 people in 1980 to 12.8 in 1986. The death toll has risen from 26,869 to 30,904 during the same six-year period.

<TEXT>
 Education Secretary <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> said Tuesday he sees his brief, four-month tenure as a platform to speak out on the need for getting dropouts back in school and educating the illiterate, the handicapped and the dyslexic. `` The basic question is how do you position <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> so it can deal with the issue and how you bring it about _ we must educate every person to their fullest potential,'' <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Hispanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> says he's been asked why he would leave his job as a university president to take on the complexities and challenges of education secretary when it's for just a few months. Sworn in Sept. 20, <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> is the first Hispanic member of a president's <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> and serves until Jan. 20, unless renominated by the next president. `` I see it as an opportunity, a platform so to speak, as you folks in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> call it _ a window of opportunity _ to say something, to give some leadership to the things I've been saying all along as a university president,'' said <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>, who is on leave from <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. In his first speech after taking over as president of the <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION> university in 1980, <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> said he used the occasion to talk about the dropout rate, especially among Hispanics. In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, he said, 45 percent of Hispanic students drop out before finishing high school, while the rate for blacks is 32 percent and for Anglos, 30. `` I learned long ago that people do n't necessarily listen to a university president, and I'm not sure they listen to secretaries of education, but we're going to speak up,'' he said. Principal issues, he said, include helping the highly motivated student excel and move ahead; getting the dropouts back in school and into the mainstream of society; teaching the illiterate how to read; educating the handicapped to their fullest level of independence; and helping the dyslexic overcome their learning disability. `` That is the agenda of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>: That you educate everyone to their fullest potential,'' he said. `` If one person drops out, we're all the poorer for that reason,'' he said. He said he hopes to position the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> to `` start thinking about these issues ... to start thinking about the future _ where do you want this place to go, so regardless of who is secretary of education, the agenda is pretty well laid out.''

The vessels were reported about 20 miles northeast of Point Barrow before first light in <LOCATION> Barrow </LOCATION>, about noon EDT, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeze </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. A helicopter was being prepared to take representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> guard to the ship, along with an interpreter, <PERSON> Freeze </PERSON> said The Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, in a dispatch from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, said the larger of the two icrebreakers, the Admiral <PERSON> Makarov </PERSON>, had been slowed by heavy ice and by fog which rduced visibility to less than 200 yards. Meanwhile, ice experts were trying to find a way through the pressure ridge and rescuers were trying to coax the whales over a shoal between them and ridge. The whales retreated from the shoal Monday. Anticipating the imminent arrival of two Soviet icebreakers, the ice specialists were taking soundings Monday of the water depth on either side of the ridge, a jumbled mass of ice chunks about 200 yards wide and some 30 feet high. The skipper of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> icebreaker assigned to act as liaison with the Soviets and a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> analyst were among those looking for a place where the icebreaker could punch through the ridge. The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> gray whales must get through the icy tangle if they are to reach an open lead, or pathway, through the ice. The whales, stranded about 100 yards offshore more than two weeks ago by shifting ice about 13 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Barrow </LOCATION>, were about four miles from the ice ridge. A third whale disappeared Friday and is presumed dead. `` It's discouraging,'' federal biologist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Withrow </PERSON> said Monday as the mammals, apparently spooked by a shoal that has stymied progress for three days, retreated about 800 yards. `` Why come back here when they know it's open up there?'' The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> gray whales struggled up for air, tiring quickly as they poked their way through large slabs of <LOCATION> Beaufort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> ice and thick slush left by efforts to carve them a path to freedom. At one point, the 27-foot-long whale _ the smaller of the two _ rested the end of its huge snout on the edge of the ice. Blood oozed from a raw spot on its snout, smearing the ice and staining the water. Biologists called a temporary halt to opening new breathing holes so the whales would have a chance to rest and perhaps seek the open water on their own. Rescue coordinator <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> remained optimistic. `` They always regress some before they learn,'' <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said of the whales. `` They'll move.'' Meanwhile, specialists determined through soundings that there is about 40 feet of water beneath the pressure ridge, a jumbled mass of ice chunks about 30 feet high and as wide as two football fields. `` There is a lot of water flowing beneath the ridge, which should mean it will be easier -LRB- for the Soviet icebreakers -RRB- to break through'' than had been expected, <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said. The icebreakers Admiral <PERSON> Makarov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Arseniev </PERSON> were expected to arrive this morning. The Soviet help was requested by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government and the environmental group <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION>. The whales must make their way through the ridge if they are to reach a lead, or pathway, through the ice. The nearest open water is 200 miles away in the <LOCATION> Chukchi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. Breaching the ridge wo n't do any good if the whales ca n't be coaxed past the shoal. The animals, stranded about 100 yards offshore more than two weeks ago by shifting ice 13 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Barrow </LOCATION>, were four miles from the ridge. A third whale, which disappeared Friday, is presumed dead. A shift in tactics Monday proved disappointing. Eskimos connected a series of breathing holes to form a single open channel about 600 yards long. Instead of pushing the broken ice back under the ice sheet, they used long poles to guide it toward the rear of the slot. The idea was to keep the whales from heading back. Initially, it worked. The whales swam back and forth between the shoal's edge and the rear of the channel. But when the channel behind them was nearly filled, the whales turned back. About 12 feet of water lies over the 125-yard-wide shoal, said biologist <PERSON> Geoff </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>. The whales have been spending most of the time in water 17 to 25 feet deep. `` As it gets shallower, it feels -LRB- to the whales -RRB- like they're beaching themselves,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>, a biologist from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mammal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> Officials hope at least one of the Soviet icebreakers can breach the ridge, said Rear Adm. <PERSON> Sigmund </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mammal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> Charts indicate the water at the ridge is about 30 feet deep, and the 443-foot-long Admiral <PERSON> Makarov </PERSON> needs about 35 feet to operate, <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> said. The smaller <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Arseniev </PERSON> needs about 22 feet. `` It does seem that the Makorov would have more trouble doing this,'' he said. `` But they may be able to assist each other. I'm sure that these vessels, which have operated in the Arctic for years, have all kinds of solutions to these things. Biologists have a last-ditch option: airlifting the whales to open water. <PERSON> Withrow </PERSON> emphasized that would be a last resort because the whales could be injured or traumatized. Although rescuers said they were committed to freeing the whales, the cost of the effort continues to mount. Most of those involved in the attempt seem reluctant to talk about the tab but it appears substantial _ at least $ 600,000 by late Monday.

 Orders to factories for `` big ticket'' durable goods dropped 4.1 percent in September, pulled down by sharp declines in the volatile defense and transportation sectors, the government said today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said total orders fell $ 5.0 billion to a seasonally adjusted $ 117.7 billion last month. The steep decline follows a big 5.7 percent increase in August and a 7.4 percent drop in July, the worst monthly decline in four years. The durable goods total, which includes manufactured goods ranging from household appliances to huge airliners, has been buffeted up and down in recent months by wide swings in orders for aircraft, ships and tanks, affecting both the transportation and military sectors. Orders for transportation equipment in September were down 10.2 percent to $ 31.2 billion, following an 18.6 percent jump in August and a 22.5 percent plummet in July. Aircraft and shipbuilding pulled the category down last month. Orders for defense goods fell 12.3 percent to $ 7.0 billion last month, following a 14.7 percent rise in August and a 49.4 percent drop in July. Excluding defense, orders fell 3.5 percent in September, rose 5.1 percent in August and fell 2.2 percent in July. Excluding transportation, orders were down 1.7 percent last month, following a 1.3 percent rise and a 1.0 percent fall. However, the weakness was widespread in September. Electrical machinery was down 4.1 percent, the second consecutive monthly decline, while non-electrical machinery dropped 7.5 percent. The key category of non-defense capital goods, considered a good barometer for business expansion plans, fell 11.9 percent to $ 34.1 billion, the steepest retreat since January 1986. But, it followed increases of 6.9 percent in August and 2.1 percent a month before that. The widespread weakness fits in with economists' view that the momentum of economic growth slowed as the third quarter was ending. Manufacturing, driven by strong export sales, has been one of the strongest sectors of the economy this year. Analysts disagree over whether the slowing in the third quarter represents the beginning of a decline or a temporary pause. The only area of strength in September was in primary metals, which includes steel. It rose 6.5 percent, following declines of 2.0 percent in August and 1.4 percent in July. Shipments of durable goods fell 0.8 percent last month to $ 116.9 billion, following a 4.2 percent rise in August.

 The government reported Monday that orders for `` big ticket'' durable goods plunged 4.1 percent in September, but economists are reluctant to conclude that the red-hot manufacturing boom is ending. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said total orders fell $ 5.0 billion to a seasonally adjusted $ 117.7 billion last month, pulled down by dramatic declines in the volatile defense and transportation sectors. Other categories, including machinery, computers and capital goods purchased by businesses, also fell. The latest report fits in with other signs of a slowdown last month, including the second consecutive decline in retail sales and a drop in manufacturing employment. But analysts said it was too soon to declare that manufacturing, which has driven robust economic growth this year, is slowing significantly. A boom in export sales, fueled by the lower value of the dollar, has kept factories humming. Manufacturers in turn have invested heavily to expand the capacity of their plants, spurring the fastest growth in capital spending since 1984. `` There are some cautionary notes in this report, but even so the economy is still very strong. The manufacturing sector is n't faltering just because orders went down one month,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> He noted that unusually wide swings in orders for both transportation equipment and military goods have pushed the overall orders number up and down over the last four months. Durable goods, items expected to last three or more years, include a wide range of manufactured items, from refrigerators and other household appliances to large computers and battleships. Orders had jumped 5.7 percent in August, plummeted 7.4 percent in July and soared 8.7 percent in June. Orders for transportation equipment in September were down 10.2 percent, following an 18.6 percent jump in August, while orders for defense goods fell 12.3 percent last month, following a 14.7 percent rise. Excluding defense, orders fell 3.5 percent in September. Excluding transportation, orders were down 1.7 percent. The key category of non-defense capital goods, considered a good barometer for business expansion plans, fell 11.9 percent. It was the first decline since May and the steepest retreat since January 1986. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Annable </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>, said the decline in capital goods orders was `` disquieting because it suggests a weakening in the primary engine of economic growth.'' However, he said manufacturing profits are high and factories are using a high percentage of their capacity, suggesting that capital goods orders will rebound in the months ahead. Electrical machinery also fell in September, by 4.1 percent, the second consecutive monthly decline, while non-electrical machinery dropped 7.5 percent. The only area of strength in September was in primary metals, which includes steel. It rose 6.5 percent, following declines of 2.0 percent in August and 1.4 percent in July. Shipments of durable goods fell 0.8 percent in September to $ 116.9 billion, following a 4.2 percent increase in August. The backlog of unfilled orders expanded by a modest 0.2 percent to $ 431.9 billion last month after three strong gains from June through August. In a separate report Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> said sales of existing single-family homes fell 2.2 percent in September. It was only the second decline since January.

<HEAD>Basic Skills Remain Top Priority for High School Principals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CRISPIN Y. CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Teaching the three Rs _ reading, ` riting and ` rithmetic _ is still the most important goal for high school educators, according to a survey released Tuesday that also shows teachers increasingly are concerned about gangs and crowded `` There has been a tremendous increase in concern about basic skills, and states are now testing like they never have before,'' said <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pellicer </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION>, who compiled the study for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Secondary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Principals </ORGANIZATION>. `` In my own view, Americans, in general, feel the schools have not done a good enough job in basic skills to prepare -LRB- their children -RRB- to function as literate members of society,'' <PERSON> Pellicer </PERSON> told a news conference. The report, titled `` High School Leaders and Their Schools,'' summarizes the organization's 1987 survey of 1,225 high school principals and assistant principals in 1,544 schools. It is a follow-up to similar surveys in 1965 and 1977. The study indicated that the top three goals of school officials _ teaching students basic skills, helping them develop positive self-images, and furthering intellectual inquiry and problem solving skills _ remained the same as in the 1977 survey. Teaching basic skills also was the top priority in 1965, but that year the second and third top objectives were, respectively, promoting development of moral and spiritual values, and promoting an understanding of the American system. Today's high school principals also see a greater need to prepare American youth `` for a changing world'' _ a goal that was fourth in the latest survey, up from eighth in 1977. The other goals identified in the new survey were, in order: promoting development of moral and spiritual values; providing career planning and training in special entry-level job skills; promoting understanding of the American value system; teaching skills needed in a technological society; teaching skills for family life; promoting physical fitness; and offering exposure to the fine arts. When asked which of 27 conditions would have an impact on their schools in the next five years, almost half -LRB- 49 percent -RRB- said gang activity would have a strong influence, followed by 39 percent who listed increases in enrollment and 37 percent who identified youth unemployment. This finding was a surprise to <PERSON> Pellicer </PERSON> and association executive director, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON>, who noted that gang activity listed well above drug -LRB- 17 percent -RRB- and alcohol abuse -LRB- 20 percent -RRB-. `` The only interpretation I can have on that is they might see the drug scene evolving into more of a gang scene,'' <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON> said, noting conversations with principals in urban areas not known for gang activity. <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON> said he also was surprised that, despite slight salary increases in the last decade, the overwhelming majority -LRB- 89 percent -RRB- of those questioned said they received the most job satisfaction from their ability to help others. Asked to rate a list of skills and characteristics needed by teachers, the administrators ranked the top five as competence in subject matter; adjusting instruction to students; interpersonal skills with students; competence in methods; and skill in developing positive student self-images. Results of the poll had a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points.

 If all else fails and rescuers scrambling to free two gray whales trapped by Arctic ice are forced to airlift the mammals to freedom, a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> company is ready to fashion a custom sling. `` We're on call,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> of <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> <PERSON> Sail </PERSON> and Canvas in <LOCATION> Carlsbad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` I've already picked up the fabric.

Dr. <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Dahlheim </PERSON>, an oceanographer with the <ORGANIZATION> NMFS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mammal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, said her office sought advice from <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> because the marine life park has used such slings and had the appropriate contacts to locate a manufacturer. It recommended <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>. `` The OK has not been given to start cutting the material,'' she said. `` ... We need people who have done this before. And they are the experts. You do n't re-invent the wheel when you do n't have to.'' National Oceanic and <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administraiton </ORGANIZATION> biologists have said hauling the trapped whales to open water would be a last alternative because of the danger of harming the whales. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, with 22 years experience in custom sewing and manufacturing, said he already has designed a sling for the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> whales. `` It's going to be flat, more like a rectangle. It's not going to be real exotic because we do n't have time to cut holes out for fins,'' he said. `` It's going to a large, flat sling, about 30 feet long, reinforced with metal rods. It's got to hold 12 tons. Normally, I cut in fin holes, but this a different kind of mammal.'' He said the finished product would look like a large stretcher with various holes for the helicopter to pick up the sling. `` I've never made one this large before. The whales that <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> picks up are about 20 feet, these whales are longer.'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said he has made slings for <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> World </LOCATION> for about 10 years.

 A year after Rep. <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> nearly died of breathing problems, a rare transplant has given him new lungs and a renewed shot for a 10th term in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Five months after he underwent the double-lung transplant, however, <PERSON> Spence </PERSON>'s health remains a central issue in his re-election campaign. The 60-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Lexington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> faces a challenge from <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> banker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Leventis </PERSON> and has recently begun to step up his campaigning. <PERSON> Spence </PERSON>'s surgeon and colleagues say the congressman has made a strong recovery from the sometimes-fatal operation. For six months, while he waited for a lung transplant after being diagnosed with chronic obstructive lung disease, <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> moved about in a wheelchair aided by portable oxygen. Others worried about his future. `` Before his operation, he was having trouble breathing,'' said <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Fant </PERSON>, spokesman for Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Spratt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, who serves with <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> on the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` It was pretty obvious he was having trouble speaking. He was wheezing and coughing a lot and he looked bad.'' In May, the wait ended, and doctors at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> successfully transplanted the lungs of an 18-year-old <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> motorcycle accident victim into <PERSON> Spence </PERSON>. <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> spent the next few months learning to walk and to hold his head erect again, before being released July 15. His surgeon, Dr. <PERSON> Seshadri </PERSON> <PERSON> Raju </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> has successfully passed the dangerous three months immediately after surgery and should now be OK. `` Right now he is brand new Right now I think he has the outlook of any 60-year-old who is healthy,'' <PERSON> Raju </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> hospital where <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> received his new lungs had performed only three double-lung transplants before <PERSON> Spence </PERSON>. Two of the three patients have died. Since Spence, two more have had the operation, one of whom died, and the other remains hospitalized, spokeswoman <PERSON> Janis </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> said he feels fine, although he admitted to some tiredness and swelling in his ankles that at times inhibits walking. The swelling is a side-effect of the anti-rejection medicine he takes. But he said he maintains a 12-hour work day, uses weights for strength in his upper body and tries to walk the quarter-mile from his office to the Capitol to increase his fitness. `` It's just amazing that I have accommodated myself _ my body has _ to these new lungs like it has,'' he said. `` Of course, I've got some tightness in my chest because I've got wire in it and everything else,'' he said. Since <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> returned to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Sept. 14, those familiar with him say they've seen a dramatic change. `` I do n't think there's any problem about his health at all,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Florida </LOCATION>, who chairs a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> on which <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> is the ranking Republican. `` There are lots of people in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> weaker than he.'' But, indirectly, <PERSON> Leventis </PERSON> has raised the issue of <PERSON> Spence </PERSON>'s ability to perform his duties Earlier this month, <PERSON> Leventis </PERSON> released a letter in which <PERSON> Spence </PERSON>'s former doctor urged the congressman to answer <PERSON> Leventis </PERSON>' call for a debate A Spence spokesman accused Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moxon </PERSON> of playing `` fast and loose with the Hippocratic oath,'' but <PERSON> Moxon </PERSON> denied any impropriety. `` His health has been a public issue and it sounds like they're hiding behind it,'' he said A poll of 515 district voters conducted by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> recently found only 30 percent thought health should be an issue in the campaign. The poll was conducted Oct. 10-12 and contained a 4.3 percent margin of error. That same poll found voters preferring <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> 52 percent to 42 percent over <PERSON> Leventis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Leventis </PERSON> has never directly said <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> is unable to represent the district. He said health should never be a standard by which public officials are elected. `` That's for him to judge,'' <PERSON> Leventis </PERSON> said of <LOCATION> Spence </LOCATION>. `` He says he's fine and I accept that.'' <PERSON> Spence </PERSON>, though, has accused <PERSON> Leventis </PERSON> of less than honorable intentions in entering the race, which <PERSON> Leventis </PERSON> denies. `` I'm sure this one thought I was dead or going to die,'' he said after the transplant. `` But I was still wiggling out there.''

<HEAD>Mystery Malady Kills, Blinds Pelicans</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Wildlife officials combed <LOCATION> Pelican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> on Tuesday for clues to a mysterious malady that has killed more than 100 brown pelicans and left scores of others blinded and weakened. State biologists speculated that a larval parasite that attacks the birds' eyes and head had spread among the large population on this small island in the <LOCATION> Halifax </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> south of <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. Among the dead or dying birds in the mangroves on the 400-yard-long island were several snowy egrets. Carcasses of some dead pelicans and several sickened birds, including a snowy egret, were being studied at the veterinary hospital at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Gainesville </LOCATION>. Officials there said it could take days or weeks to determine a cause. Veterinarians and animal specialists were stunned by the deaths. `` It's almost like a leprosy,'' said <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Swain </PERSON>, a wildlife rehabilitator. `` It's eating away, rotting their skulls. The bone was almost exposed.'' `` Nobody's ever seen it like this,'' said <PERSON> Michele </PERSON> <PERSON> Yown </PERSON>, a Marine Patrol officer. In efforts to prevent spread of the disease, <PERSON> Swain </PERSON> and colleagues gave lethal injections to 38 blinded birds, which were then cremated, on Monday. The sick birds are lethargic and easy to catch. `` You can walk right up to them,'' said <PERSON> Swain </PERSON>. `` If you can catch it -LRB- a bird -RRB-, there's something wrong with it.'' Lt. <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitt </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Game </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fresh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said the birds become disoriented, losing their ability to fly or walk well. Other game officials said the birds did not appear to have been poisoned, and they did not believe pollution was to blame. No similar problems were found on neighboring small islands, most of which are made from dredge material like <LOCATION> Pelican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Minshew </PERSON>, assistant director of environmental health for the <ORGANIZATION> Volusia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said it was unlikely that the birds' disease can spread to humans. `` I've never heard any reports of diseases that go from pelicans or snowy egrets to humans,'' he said. `` It appears to be very specific to the two species.'' The brown pelican was removed from the endangered-species list along the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> in 1985, when the population swelled, according to the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Forrester </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> veterinarian, said pelicans occasionally die in large numbers around the state. One of three things is usually to blame, <PERSON> Forrester </PERSON> said: blood in the intestines, starvation, or an abnormally high number of stomach worms that result when pelicans change their diet from one species of fish to another. He declined to speculate about the deadly malady on <LOCATION> Pelican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Police Arrest 30 People in Cinema Arson Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Investigators detained 37 people Tuesday for questioning in the arson attack on a Left Bank theater showing <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scorsese </PERSON>'s `` Last Temptation of Christ,'' police sources said. All but seven later were released. The fire was the latest event in a campaign of violence aimed at scaring spectators and driving the movie out of French cinemas. Interior Minister <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Joxe </PERSON> called the violence `` reminiscent of the worst moments of the Inquisition.'' Thirteen people were injured in the Saturday night blaze at the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michel </LOCATION> theater. Police sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the arrests came after early morning raids in the homes of people connected to an `` extreme-right milieu.'' Police released all but seven of those arrested Thursday night. They said seven people remained in custody did not elaborate. They were not immediately charged, and their names were not disclosed. Under French law they can be held for questioning for 48 hours. Several hundred people, including government officials, religious leaders and film directors, demonstrated in support of the film Monday in front of the damaged cinema. The film opened in 17 <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> theaters on Sept. 28, but remains in only one city cinema. A spokeswoman at <ORGANIZATION> UIP </ORGANIZATION>, the French distributor, said the film had been running in about 30 cities before the weekend attack, but only 10 afterward. Moviegoers have encountered fires, stink bombs, firebombs and tear gas. `` We must not allow ourselves to be intimidated by such acts,'' said Culture Minister <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Lang </PERSON>. Roman Catholic bishops have criticized the film, but refused to participate in public demonstrations saying they did not support censorship. Traditionalist Roman Catholic groups, however, have staged protests and urged the government to ban the movie. Some of those groups are linked to extreme-right politicians. Interior Minister <PERSON> Joxe </PERSON> called those responsible for the fire `` crazy fundamentalists.'' Several public protests to the film have been led by supporters of <PERSON> Abbot </PERSON> <PERSON> Philippe </PERSON> <PERSON> Laguerie </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nicolas </LOCATION> du Chardonnet parish, a stronghold of traditionalist Roman Catholic followers of rebel Archbishop <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON>. <PERSON> Laguerie </PERSON> condemned the cinema fire but said in a sermon Sunday that <PERSON> Scorsese </PERSON>'s `` blasphemous and ignominious film'' was to blame. Authorities also have been criticized for not doing enough to prevent the violence. In <LOCATION> Lyon </LOCATION>, protesters threw tear gas at moviegoers waiting to buy tickets and assaulted the cashier and projectionist. In Nice, street fighting broke out between spectators and protesters. Theaters were vandalized in <LOCATION> Grenoble </LOCATION> and one in <LOCATION> Besancon </LOCATION> was destroyed by a firebomb. A <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> theater near the Opera was also badly damaged by fire. Attendance throughout <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> plummeted and many theaters replaced `` Last Temptation'' with other movies. `` The violence definitely scared off many people,'' said <PERSON> Dominique </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumont </PERSON>, the manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Quatorze </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Juillet-Bastille </ORGANIZATION> theater, which ran the film for two weeks. <PERSON> Dumont </PERSON> said he searched spectators and turned away nearly a dozen people carrying tear gas canisters. Roman Catholic church officials advised against seeing the movie, which portrays <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> as having human passions, including a dream sequence in which he makes love with prostitute <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Magdalene </PERSON>.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is seeking a deal with the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> to allow repair of Soviet military vessels at a shipyard adjacent to the strategic <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> naval base at <LOCATION> Subic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, government officials say. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s chief spokesman, said Tuesday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` would not look favorably'' on any such arrangement because of `` the opportunities it might afford the Soviets to spy on our activities at <LOCATION> Subic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>.'' `` The Philippine government is well aware of our feelings on that,'' he said. At the same time, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said he could not confirm that negotiations between the Filipinos and the Soviets were taking place. There were conflicting reports Tuesday about the status of the reported Soviet request. One official said a deal between the two countries had already been signed, while another that the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> was `` tempted'' by the offer but had made no decision. A third official said there was considerable confusion about the intentions of both the Soviets and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. All the officials asked that their names not be used. The <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> has rejected previous Soviet requests for access to the Philseco repair yard. But economic and political factors appear to be prompting it to reassess that position, the officials said. The Philseco yard, a joint venture between Philippine and Japanese interests, has been losing money. In addition, the new Soviet proposal comes at a time when many Filipinos are seeking a relationship more independent of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But the officials said close Soviet access to <PERSON> Subic </PERSON> <PERSON> Bay </PERSON> would not only be an intelligence-gathering bonus for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> but would also enable Soviet vessels to remain longer in the region, thus enhancing the Soviets' military capability, the officials said. The desire for ship repair facilities apparently reflects a major Soviet military buildup in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> in recent years. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> has increased the number of ships and submarines in its Pacific fleet by 40 vessels to a total of 860 since the end of 1984. Approval of the Soviet proposal also would be seen as further evidence of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>' desire to dissociate itself from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. A more independent Filipino stance was apparent during recent base negotiations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which frequently were marked by bitter acrimony. A week ago, the two countries signed an agreement to provide the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> with $ 962 million in military and economic aid over the next two years in exchange for continued <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> access to Subic and to <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Air </PERSON> <PERSON> Base </PERSON>. They are the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military installations overseas. As a reflection of the continuing strain in relations, both the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have left open the possibility that their 1947 base agreement will not be renewed when it expires in 1991. Reaction in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> to the aid agreement has been hostile, partly because Filipino negotiators backed away from their original demand for more than $ 1 billion annually in assistance. Still, the $ 481 million in annual aid agreed to for 1990 and 1991 represented a sharp increase from the $ 180 million the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had been pledging since 1983. As <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials see it, Philippine President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> could seek to placate opposition to the aid agreement by approving the Soviet request for a ship repair deal at <LOCATION> Philseco </LOCATION>.

 A judge who sentenced a teen-age mother to lifetime birth control for neglect of her two young children has denied her permission to travel to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to appear on television. <ORGANIZATION> Maricopa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> Budzyn </PERSON> ruled Monday that letting <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Forster </PERSON>, 18, go to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> next month to appear on the <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON> talk show `` would be like throwing her into the mouths of sharks. `` She is not ready for it. It could hurt her and it would not be in her best interest. She's making the kinds of rehabilitatives strides than an interruption, with this kind of media coverage, could disrupt.'' The judge also was invited to appear on the Donahue show but declined. Ms. <PERSON> Forster </PERSON> was sentenced in May to lifetime probation for leaving her two small sons alone for nearly three days without food or water in a hot <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> apartment. As a condition of her probation, Ms. <PERSON> Forster </PERSON> was ordered to remain on birth control for the remainder of her child-bearing years and was prohibited from leaving <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> without court approval. The birth control restriction was lifted as unenforceable in August when Ms. <PERSON> Budzyn </PERSON> learned that Ms. <PERSON> Forster </PERSON> was pregnant again. Ms. <PERSON> Forster </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, had asked the judge to permit the woman to go to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, arguing that her appearance on the show `` would serve the public interest, would serve rehabilitation and will enhance the reputation of the bench.'' The judge, in refusing the request, noted that she has carefully monitored Ms. <PERSON> Forster </PERSON>'s activities and that the woman is receiving pre-natal care, intensive counseling, is studying for her high school diploma, is learning to cook and is staying drug-free. Ms. <PERSON> Forster </PERSON> was pregnant in May 1987 when she left her sons, then 7 months old and 18 months old, in her <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> apartment. When the boys' father found them, they were severely dehydrated and one was near death, according to court testimony. The boys were taken into custody of <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protective </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> and their mother has been barred from seeing them again. A daughter born while Ms. <PERSON> Forster </PERSON> was in jail awaiting resolution of her case was immediately put up for adoption. Ms. <PERSON> Forster </PERSON>, who has reconciled with her husband, said that the baby she now carries `` is the most important thing in her life,'' the judge said. `` She said this is the first time in her life that she has people who care for her,'' Ms. <PERSON> Budzyn </PERSON> said. `` I felt pretty good after talking with her.''

<TEXT>
 Launch of the Hubble Space Telescope, a powerful instrument that is expected to collect the clearest views yet of the universe, will be moved up from February 1990 to December 1989, space agency officials said Tuesday. The change came as a result of a `` reassessment'' of the space shuttle launch schedule, according to a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> announcement. However, <PERSON> Dwayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said plans call for a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> shuttle flight that had been set for December 1989, to switch places in the flight schedule with the Hubble launch, enabling the telescope to get into space two months earlier than previously planned. Experts believe the telescope will be able to study stars and galaxies more than 14 billion light years from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and to capture images of the universe that are much clearer than those seen by ground-based telescopes. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> originally planned to the launch the Hubble in 1985, but the date slipped to the fall of 1986 and then was delayed because of the January 1986 explosion of the space shuttle Challenger. The original development costs of the Hubble were estimated at $ 435 million, but due to delays and other problems the costs through June 1989 are now estimated at $ 1.5 billion. A space shuttle will carry the telescope into an orbit about 360 miles above the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. This will put it far above the atmosphere that often obscures the view of ground-based telescopes. The space telescope is designed to transmit its observations to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> for about three years. A shuttle then would visit the observatory to replace batteries and to make repairs if needed. The telescope also would be boosted into a higher orbit as needed to keep it from falling to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. With regular maintenance, the Hubble is designed to operate for at least 15 years.

 <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, the ex-Bronx Democratic boss already serving 12 years for racketeering, was convicted Tuesday of bribing a National Guard general to get a contract for a company in which <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> was the largest stockholder. The disgraced politician faces up to seven years in prison for his conviction on bribery and conspiracy charges by state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Santagata </PERSON>, who heard the case without a jury. <PERSON> Santagata </PERSON> will sentence <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> Nov. 15 on the bribery conviction. Both <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>'s convictions stem from his efforts to drum up business through bribery on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> CitiSource </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a company in which he was the largest stockholder. After <PERSON> Santagata </PERSON>'s ruling, <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Shargell </PERSON> asked the judge to sentence his client immediately, allowing <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> to end his stay at <LOCATION> Rikers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Santagata </PERSON> declined to do so. <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> had been serving time at an out-of-state federal facility, but was moved to the city jail for the duration of his trial, which began Sept. 19. In the federal case, <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> and three co-defendants were convicted in November 1986 for a scheme to get a $ 22.7 million <ORGANIZATION> Parking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Violations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> contract for hand-held computers through a pattern of racketeering.

<HEAD>Archaeologists Think They've Found Gate Jesus Used</HEAD>

 Archaeologists digging on the south slope of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zion </LOCATION> believe they have found the gate through which <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> after the Last Supper, a project leader said Tuesday. Volunteer researchers and students found what they believe to be remnants of the gate last summer while excavating a site along the walls of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` This is more evidence that we are standing on the cradle of Christianity,'' the Rev. <PERSON> Bargil </PERSON> <PERSON> Pixner </PERSON>, co-director of the project, said during a tour of the site. `` It is an incredible find.'' Ancient coins and pottery scattered near the gate prove the ruins date to the time of Christ, said archaeologist <PERSON> Doron </PERSON> <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Members of the team said they found the gate's remains _ a broken support column and stone blocks that formed an arch _ in a maze of walls and towers dating as far back as 700 B.C. <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> said the gate, buried beneath more than 12 feet of dirt and rock, was built in 37 B.C. and destroyed about 100 years later when the Romans conquered <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> again. <PERSON> Pixner </PERSON>, a priest at the <ORGANIZATION> Benedictine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abbey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dormition </ORGANIZATION>, said the dating and the location on the southern edge of Mount Zion match biblical accounts of the Last Supper. `` It can safely be presumed that <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> used this gate on his way to and from the Last Supper,'' he said, pointing to the spot about 800 feet farther up <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zion </LOCATION> where Christians believe <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> met the apostles. `` Everything we've found indicates that this is the place,'' <PERSON> Pixner </PERSON> declared. The Bible's account of the Last Supper says <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> was staying in nearby <LOCATION> Bethany </LOCATION> and told the apostles to go to <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, where a man carrying a water pitcher would lead them to their meeting place. <PERSON> Pixner </PERSON> said he believes <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> and the apostles gathered at a guest house near where the excavators found the remnants of the gate, which he described as about 10 feet wide and 15-20 feet high. They have named it the Gate of Essene after a small Jewish religious community believed to have lived in the area. Two British archaeologists found the wall adjacent to the gate while tunneling about 100 years ago but did not find the gate, <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Pixner </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Dormition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abbey </ORGANIZATION>, which raised about $ 80,000 in private donations for the dig, plans to open the site to visitors when studies of it are complete.

<HEAD>Curfew Ends; 4 Killed In Attacks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police firing tear gas charged thousands of protesters in three anti-government demonstrations Tuesday, a day after a bomb attack killed eight people at a governing party meeting. Police initially blamed Sinhalese extremists for the Monday evening bombing in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, but party officials did not rule out that opposing political parties were behind the explosion. Military officials suspected Sinhalese extremists in the killings of four people Monday night and Tuesday. No casualties were reported in Tuesday's demonstrations in central and south <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. The government placed an 18-hour curfew on the capital after reports the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a radical Sinhalese group, was planning a daylong strike. The government said it feared a strike would lead to more violence. The curfew lapsed late Tuesday, and police guarded intersections as thousands of residents went out to buy provisions. Violence in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> has escalated with the approach of presidential elections scheduled for Dec. 19. The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> opposes the government's peace overtures to minority Tamils fighting for an independent homeland on the north and east of the island. The front has been blamed for more than 500 killings since <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> signed a July 1987 peace accord aimed at ending the 5-year-old Tamil separatist war. Many have been politicians with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, also predominantly Sinhalese. In central <LOCATION> Welimada </LOCATION> province, about 70 miles east of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, police fired tear gas and charged with batons into an estimated 5,000 anti-government demonstrators. The demonstrators sat on public highways and refused to move, officials said. Police were unable to disperse them, officials said. State-run television said there were no casulties. In the town of <LOCATION> Medawachchiya </LOCATION>, about 90 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, police were called to disperse 3,000 protesters, including many <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks and schoolchildren, who were demanding the government's resignation. In the southern <LOCATION> Uva </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paranagama </LOCATION> province similar demonstrations were held, but details were not immediately available. Police said three people were killed in the town of <LOCATION> Welimada </LOCATION> late Monday by suspected members of the front. In <LOCATION> Kandy </LOCATION>, Sinhalese gunmen killed a postmaster Tuesday, police said. Police in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> said the death toll in the bombing Monday rose to eight after three more people died of their wounds Tuesday. At least 40 others were injured, they added. Sinhalese extremists say the peace accord grants too many concessions to the Tamils, who form 18 percent of the country's 16 million people. Sinhalese make up 75 percent of the population. The front has put up posters in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> and others parts of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> demanding President <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON>'s resignation, the rejection of the peace accord and the withdrawal of 47,000 Indian troops in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> to quell the Tamil rebellion. The Tamils claim they were discriminated against by the Sinhalese, who control <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s military and government.

<HEAD>Notices Go Out Nov. 14 on 90,000 Delinquent Farm Loans Worth $8
Billion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> will begin sending out notices shortly after the Nov. 8 election in an effort to collect $ 8.8 billion in past-due loans, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> agency said Tuesday. Spokesman <PERSON> Marlyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Aycock </PERSON> said rules implementing new credit legislation will take effect Nov. 14 and that `` Dear Farmer Jones'' notices will start going out soon thereafter to an estimated 90,000 delinquent FmHA borrowers. <PERSON> Aycock </PERSON> said the notices will say: `` This is to inform you that you're seriously behind in your loan payments and to inform you of your options. Farmers who are more than 180 days late in making payments have several options.'' The notices will explain that the <ORGANIZATION> FmHA </ORGANIZATION> borrowers must notify the agency within 45 days if they intend to apply to make arrangements for settling their debts. Details regarding the options, including debt restructuring and write-offs, also will be provided. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> ordered <ORGANIZATION> FmHA </ORGANIZATION> to revise its lending practices in the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987. The agency often is called the farm lender of last resort because it makes loans only to those who can not qualify at banks or other commercial sources. The debt write-down, or forgiveness provision, is regarded as one of the most important parts of the 1987 law. It allows FmHA to reduce a farmer's delinquent debt to the recovery value of the collateral, which is usually land or farm equipment, depending on cash flow and other factors. Also, as the result of lawsuits, the <ORGANIZATION> FmHA </ORGANIZATION> is under court order to redo many of its loan regulations and to delay foreclosures and forced liquidations until those actions are completed. Estimates of the extent of <ORGANIZATION> FmHA </ORGANIZATION> loan delinquencies and numbers of farmers potentially threatened by foreclosure under the new rules have varied. Last May 23, when the new regulations were proposed, FmHA losses resulting from write-offs and other settlements were estimated at about $ 8.7 billion and that about 118,000 borrowers were delinquent. About 64,800 of those could be pushed into liquidation or foreclosure because they could n't qualify for help under the new law. Another major step was an interim rule announced on Sept. 14, including procedures for making debt restructuring and write-downs. Those were to take effect on Oct. 14 on an interim basis and called for final adoption on Nov. 14 after a 60-day period for public comments. In the September announcement, the earlier analysis was used again. It referred to 118,000 delinquent borrowers, including about 65,000 who would be rejected for debt write-downs. The potential losses were said to be as high as $ 9.4 billion, although about $ 1 billion could be salvaged by the agency. <PERSON> Aycock </PERSON> said the current estimate of 90,000 delinquent borrowers was based on figures last fall, when FmHA delinquencies usually are lower than those in January, when the 118,000 were reported.

 Opposition leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> on Tuesday urged President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo to accelerate reforms and recover fortunes allegedly amassed by a former leader. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>, who addressed the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> as head of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s main opposition party, also proposed changes in relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that would give <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> more independence and check anti-U.S. sentiment The leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> said the time had come `` to open sincere discussions about the strict enforcement of jurisdiction over <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops, nuclear weapons and the transfer of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commandership over South Korean troops.'' Under treaties signed during the 1950-53 Korean War, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has no jurisdiction over <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers stationed in the country. At the <ORGANIZATION> Hankook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, about 100 students armed with firebombs and rocks battled riot police on Tuesday, demanding the withdrawl of about 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops stationed in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Also on Tuesday, about 40 students staged a peaceful anti-U.S. protest in front of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy. A majority of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> support the presence of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops, but dissidents contend the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has hampered reunification of the divided peninsula. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> attributed the growing anti-Americanism to nationalism brought by rapid political and economic changes, as well as the country's pride as the host of the Olympics. The opposition leader urged <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> to take a courageous stand against former President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON>, whom opponents accuse of amassing wealth through corruption. During a parliamentary investigation of state affairs that began Oct. 5, opposition lawmakers found evidence of widespread corruption, irregularities and violation of human rights by <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> and his followers. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> charged <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> and his family with amassing hundreds of millions of dollars during his seven years in office and demanded the money be returned to help the poor. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> also called for an end to alleged wiretapping, torture and political surveillance of students and dissidents by police and other security organs. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, a former general who succeeded <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> in February, is gaining popularity with his proposed reforms and efforts to improve relations with <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc nations, some of whom have exchanged trade offices with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Dissidents and radical students have vowed to launch a nationwide campaign next week to press for the arrest of <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> and his family.

 Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> on Tuesday defended <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign against charges of distortion and lying, and he said the Democrats were the ones dishing `` political sludge.'' His remarks on a campaign swing through <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> came about a week after Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> called <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> campaign literature `` political garbage.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was a 25-year public servant who `` has built a career resting on unshakable integrity and fairness.'' `` The personal attacks now being made on him by a desperate opponent are outrageous,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said in a luncheon address to a <ORGANIZATION> Rotary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> in Stone Mountain. `` The political sludge that is being dished out by Mr. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' surrogates and which I believe the governor is actively encouraging is despicable,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said He also accused <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of shifts of position that `` tell us something about how steady that candidate would be if elected.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> listed issues on which the Republicans have attacked <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> _ tax increases in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, borrowing from that state's pension fund, pollution of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, gun control, and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' defense positions _ and rejected <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' complaint that his positions have been distorted. After Stone Mountain event, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, and was to campaign Wednesday in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. The foray into <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, a state considered safely in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s hands in the general election, was geared to help Rep. <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> in his GOP Senate race against Rep. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> advisers said. One of the advisers brought in to oversee <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s campaign, <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>, said the strategy from now until the election is for <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> to keep a low profile nationally while hitting regionally significant areas. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who has generally steered clear of major cities, will continue making campaign appearances in rural or suburban communities where the visit of a candidate is a big deal, <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> said. `` He's very effective in midsize and smaller communities,'' <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> said, adding that if <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> can make an impact on 5,000 to 10,000 votes at a given appearance, with `` a few days in a row of that you can swing a state like <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, according to her husband, phoned to tell him, `` You must be making great speeches, drawing tremendous crowds, really getting them on their feet and saying all the right things ... because I have n't heard one thing about you this week.' That, said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, is the `` typical role of the vice presidential candidate and we're glad to fill that role.'' The senator has seemed to settle into a pattern of ease in his campaign that contrasts with the restrained style he showed early on. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and his advisers say that his selection by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> eventually will be seen as having little impact on the outcome of the election. There are some voters who have a negative reaction to him and feel he is not qualified, but other voters may be drawn by his youth and conservatism, <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> said.

 A remote-controlled car bomb exploded Tuesday in the in the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> as a <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> armored personnel carrier was passing, injuring 10 Syrian soldiers and five <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> civilians, police said. No one claimed responsibility for the 1:30 p.m. blast outside a grocery store in the Syrian-policed town of <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> <PERSON> Elias </PERSON>, the 16th car bombing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this year. The car was packed with 88 pounds of explosives when it blew up in the town about 30 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, said a police spokesman reached by telephone in <LOCATION> Zahle </LOCATION>, provincial capital of the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION>. `` It was detonated by remote control as the -LRB- Syrian vehicle -RRB- was rolling past the grocery. But it seems the vehicle and its occupants escaped unharmed,'' said the spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Initial reports only mentioned the civilian casualties, but a police statement later reported the 10 Syrians wounded. The injured were taken by ambulances to a <LOCATION> Zahle </LOCATION> hospital. The Voice of the Nation radio station said Syrian troops cordoned off <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> for an hour after the blast. The town has a predominantly Sunni Moslem population of 30,000. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> maintains an estimated 40,000 soldiers in the eastern and northern provinces as well as Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The force is supported by <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Moslems and leftists, and violently opposed by right-wing Christians who regard the Syrians an occupying power. By police count, 104 people were killed and 378 wounded in 15 previous car bombings in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since April 23.

 A black cat has turned up 10 miles from home nearly three years after it disappeared. `` It's like he has been resurrected,'' <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilgore </PERSON> said Monday. `` This is one cat that really has nine lives, I guess.'' A telephone call from a woman across town Sunday afternoon sent Ms. <PERSON> Kilgore </PERSON> racing over to see if the animal wearing her cat's worn leather collar and metal identification tag was really her lost cat, <LOCATION> Winston </LOCATION>. `` I hopped in the car, with tears streaming down my face,'' Ms. <PERSON> Kilgore </PERSON> said. The woman who found the cat said <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> emitted a meow of relief as Ms. <PERSON> Kilgore </PERSON> picked him up for the first time since Feb. 16, 1986. `` I think he was as surprised and happy to see me as I was to see him,'' Ms. <PERSON> Kilgore </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Panel Objects To Plan To Mothball Three Mile Island Next Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Nearly 10 years after the <LOCATION> Three </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> nuclear accident in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, a panel of citizens and scientists said Tuesday that the contaminated reactor should not be mothballed next year as planned because the cleanup is not finished. But a spokesman for the power plant's operator said <ORGANIZATION> TMI </ORGANIZATION> managers hoped to go ahead with the plan to place the cripped Unit 2 reactor into `` monitored storage'' by the end of 1989. Under the plan, the reactor building would be locked, unneeded systems deactivated and the plant would sit for perhaps 30 years while radiation decays inside. Although the damaged nuclear nuclear fuel and loose radioactive components would have been removed from the plant, radiation would remain in piping and other areas of the reactor building basement. The Advisory Panel for the Decontamination of Unit 2 told the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> at a meeting Tuesday that nine of its 11 members had sided against the so-called Post Defueling Monitored Storage plan, known as PDMS. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, the panel's chairman and mayor of <LOCATION> Lancaster </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, said many in the group felt the plan was too vague. With no specific funding in place, <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said there were concerns that the cleanup of the plant might not be completed, even after the storage phase ended. In addition, he said, area residents were troubled by the uncertainty of not knowing exactly how many years the reactor would sit idle until it was decommissioned. `` The utility seems to have looked at this PDMS as a given, and sort of expected us to go along with it,'' said <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, a panel member from <LOCATION> Elizabethville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> `` It just seems it's so wide open and the public is concerned. Is it going to be 20 years, 40 years? It seems like there is such a loophole, a loophole large enough for a cooling tower to pass through,'' <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> said. Unit 2 was disabled in the nation's worst commercial nuclear accident on March 31, 1979. The reactor was allowed to lose vital cooling water that normally covers it. The subsequent $ 1 billion cleanup has focused on water decontamination, waste shipment and removal of fuel from the damaged core. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Bedell </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> GPU </ORGANIZATION> Nuclear, the plant operator, said in an interview after Tuesday's meeting that the cleanup would likely stop at the end of next year. He said it was pointless to expose cleanup workers to additional risk after that because remaining radiation would be `` fixed in place,'' presenting no threat to the public. <PERSON> Bedell </PERSON> said the utility envisioned letting Unit 2 sit idle until after its twin, Unit 1, ended its service life in about the year 2010. Then, both units would be dismantled together. <ORGANIZATION> GPU </ORGANIZATION> Nuclear would need an amendment to its <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> license before it could proceed with its storage plan. The decision on whether to grant the change would be made by the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> staff, although it is possible the commissioners themselves would get involved.

<HEAD>Kohl Says `Hard' Talks with Gorbachev, Clash on Berlin
Reunification</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said Tuesday he and President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> failed to agree on whether to reunify <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, but signed accords to help the sick Soviet food industry and put a West German in space. The chancellor earlier highlighted his concern for human rights by meeting with <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate at the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> ambassador's residence. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, speaking to reporters before a second round of talks with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, took a philosophical view to the dispute over <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> that surfaced in banquet speeches the night before. `` The last word of history is neither spoken by me or by Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said. In a dinner speech, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had said of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> dispute: `` The attempts to upset what has been created in the -LRB- postwar -RRB- process or push through unrealistic policies is an unpredictable and even dangerous business.'' He appeared to be referring to <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s proposal for a change in the status of <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and closer relations between <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> member <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and Moscow-aligned <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Since the end of World War II, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> has been under the control of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, the victorious allies. The city has been divided since 1961 by a wall that symbolizes the East-West hostility of the Cold War. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said in a radio interview in January `` there can be no real improvement in relations between <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> if <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> is not included.'' On Tuesday, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> told reporters he was not surprised by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s remarks on <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. `` The world ca n't be changed in a couple of hours,'' he said, adding that he was optimistic agreement eventually could be reached. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said Monday's talks had been `` often and in part hard.'' The two met again Tuesday, but a <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency dispatch on the session did not say whether they discussed the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> dispute. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said aides signed agreements, including one on the peaceful uses of outer space. It said the pact provides for the possibility that a West German would fly aboard the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s orbiting space station, Mir. West German officials said the pact also could have German astronauts join Soviets in traveling to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION> in 1994. West Germans have traveled to space in 1983 and 1985 aboard the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space shuttle. During recent visits by Austrian and Italian leaders, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> invited citizens of those countries to fly aboard the Mir station. Next month, French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> is to observe the launch of a French-Soviet space crew to the station. Another agreement signed Tuesday calls for West German companies to help modernize about 200 Soviet food and consumer goods factories, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. The Kremlin, faced with growing complaints, has placed priority on eliminating food and consumer goods shortages. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> met earlier Tuesday with Soviet Premier <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> to discuss economic cooperation, which includes a $ 1.6 billion German credit to the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> to finance exports in food, leather, textile and clothing. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, the founding father of the 1970s Soviet dissident movement told <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> there still are political prisoners in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and they must be released and rehabilitated, according to German spokesman <PERSON> Friedhelm </PERSON> <PERSON> Ost </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> was banished to the closed city of <LOCATION> Gorky </LOCATION> in 1980 for criticizing the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s military push into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> allowed him to return to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in December 1986. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, who arrived in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on a four-day visit Monday, paid homage Tuesday to Soviet and German victims of World War II. In freezing weather and under an gray sky, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> laid a wreath at the Soviet Tomb of the Unknown Soldier beside the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> wall. The ceremony, a protocol must for foreign dignitaries visiting <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, takes on a special poignancy when performed by a German. `` The distinguished guest honored by a minute of silence the memory of millions of Soviet people who died in the Great Patriotic War of 1941-45,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said in a brief report. An unknown Soviet soldier killed in 1941 when the Werhmacht was at the gates of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> is buried in the tomb, which is topped by an eternal flame. Total Soviet losses in World War II are officially put at 20 million, but some Soviet historians suggest that figure is far too low. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> then was driven to a walled cemetery in the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> district of <LOCATION> Lyublino </LOCATION>, where 596 German soldiers who were taken prisoner by the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> during World War II and later died in captivity are buried. On a dark granite obelisk at the cemetery's entrance, the words `` for peace and reconcilation'' are carved in Russian. Prior to <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s arrival, a solitary flower had been placed on each German soldier's grave in the front row. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> laid a wreath and walked between the graves, whose stone border had been freshly painted white.

<HEAD>U.S.-Soviet Negotiators Call For Halt To Overfishing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A top state department official said Tuesday he was encouraged by the outcome of talks in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> last week in which Soviet and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials recommended that `` immediate measures'' be taken to halt overfishing for pollock in the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>, the department's ambassador for oceans and fisheries who led the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation, also said that both countries are `` increasingly concerned'' about reports of possible illegal salmon fishing by the Japanese and the Taiwanese in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> and agreed to cooperate in enforcement activities. `` The Soviets are equally as concerned about possible illegal salmon fishing as we are,'' <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> said in an interview. `` All of these things are related because they all deal with <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> fishing.'' <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> said he was `` quite satisfied'' with the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> talks and he expected a plan for managing pollock stocks in the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> to emerge from another round of talks either late this year or in early 1989. In a joint statement, negotiators meeting in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> said scientists from both countries agreed that unregulated fishing was `` clearly detrimental'' to pollock stocks in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet zones that surround the international portion of the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. `` In light of the urgent nature of this problem, the two delegations agreed that ... immediate measures are necessary to conserve fishery resources throughout the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> ecosystem,'' the statement said. The statement gave no indication what measures the two countries might consider to halt the overfishing, but simply said, `` It is essential that all countries fishing in the central <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> meet their obligations under international law to conserve these threatened fishery resources.'' Some <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials have said one possibility is for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to declare a moratorium on fishing in the `` doughnut hole'' _ a 45,000-square-mile area of international waters in the middle of the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. Fishing vessels must pass through <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet waters to enter the `` doughnut hole,'' one of the richest fishing grounds in the world. <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> will be in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> next week for talks with Japanese about <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> fishing. `` We need to see if we can turn things around,'' said <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>. Relations between <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> over fisheries issues have deteriorated since January when seven Japanese trawlers were videotaped fishing illegally in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> waters off <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. American fishermen say the annual catch of groundfish in the `` doughnut hole'' has grown from about 200,000 metric tons to more than 1 million metric tons over the past four years. They also claim foreign trawlers use the `` doughnut hole'' as a staging ground for illegal fishing forays into the 200-mile American zone under cover of darkness or in bad weather.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> on Tuesday compared his referendum defeat to the spurning of Christ, and an opposition leader said he was `` abusing the people's patience'' by refusing calls for democratic reform. In a speech to about 3,000 women volunteers, a solemn <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> declared: `` We were defeated in a plebiscite, defeated but not vanquished.'' `` Do n't forget that in world history there was a plebiscite in which the people chose between Christ and Barabbas. And the people chose Barabbas,'' the general said. `` The people sometimes make mistakes,'' <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> added. According to the Bible, the <ORGANIZATION> Romans </ORGANIZATION> offered to set free either Christ or Barabbas, a common criminal, just before their crucifixion. The crowd chose Barabbas. The audience _ a private woman's organization headed by <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Lucia </PERSON> _ applauded loudly. On Oct. 5, voters rejected a proposal by the country's military commanders that <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, who seized power in a bloody 1973 coup, remain president until 1997. As a result he was obliged to call an open election, planned for December 1989, and hand power over to the winner in March 1990. `` We are going to keep working until the last day,'' <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> vowed in his speech, `` and then hand over the government to whom you yourselves elect.'' Opposition groups have called for <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> to step down early, and to agree to talks on reforming the 8-year-old constitution that was drafted and pushed through by his administration. They maintain that changes are needed to give future elected government full democratic powers. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> has vowed to keep the constitution intact, and <PERSON> Patricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>, president of the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, on Tuesday accused the 72-year-old authoritarian ruler of trying to provoke disorders by his intransigence. <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> want to `` push people into taking to the streets, to create a pretext for unleashing violence and repression.'' `` He is abusing the people's patience,'' <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>, a 69-year-old lawyer, is widely expected to be nominated for president by a 16-party opposition coalition that led the campaign for <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s defeat in the referendum. His party is the country's largest. The coalition has avoided calling street demonstrations or other provocative actions, fearing they could lead to a harder government line and hurt chances for talks on the reforms. But <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> said opposition leaders, who have been calling for patience among the ranks, `` will lose their credibility if things do n't advance.'' He said a Cabinet shakeup by <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> last week, in which a U.S.-trained economist, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Caceres </PERSON>, was named to head the powerful <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, did not reveal `` any readiness to respond to the opposition parties' calls for a dialog.'' <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> also complained the government had failed to heed appeals for `` goodwill gestures'' such as the release of two labor leaders in internal exile.

 Despite a housing boom in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, sales of existing homes fell 2.2 percent in September after a surprisingly strong summer, a real estate trade group said Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> said sales of existing homes declined to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.63 million units last month, following a 2.2 percent increase in August. But last month's level was still higher than most economists would have predicted this spring, when mortgage interest rates began to creep higher. Fixed-rate mortgages on average hit a low of 9.84 percent in February and rose to 10.71 percent by early August. Since then, they have eased back to 10.28 percent, but many analysts expect them to start rising again by year's end. Existing-home sales in the late spring and early summer were strong, in part because many buyers apparently purchased homes sooner than planned in an attempt to beat rising interest rates. `` The decline ... in September is a hangover from the buying spree of the summer,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON>, chief economist of the Realtors. `` The extraordinary increase'' of the summer was `` in part borrowed from September.'' <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON> predicted sales rates will continue to lag in the fourth quarter and by year's end would total 3.47 million units, down only slightly from 3.53 million in 1987. The West was the only region of the nation showing an increase of sales last month. They rose 6.0 percent to an annual rate of 710,000 units, the highest level since December 1986, following a 3.1 percent increase in August. Sales fell 5.8 percent in the <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> to 650,000 units on an annual basis, the lowest since January. They fell 3.2 percent in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> to 900,000 units and were off 2.8 percent in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> to 1.38 million units. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Savacool </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wefa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a forecasting firm in <PERSON> Bala </PERSON> <PERSON> Cynwyd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s strong economy and growing population are supporting the housing market. `` People have been moving into <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in droves, and that provides a lot of support for the housing market there even though the rest of the nation looks weak,'' <PERSON> Savacool </PERSON> said. He noted that 400,000 people moved to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> last year, more than to any other state. The main reason for sluggish sales in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> is high prices, he said. Over the past year, existing-home prices have risen most steeply in the West. The median was $ 124,300 in September, up 7.1 percent. However, the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> remained the most costly area with a median of $ 141,400, up 6.3 percent from a year earlier. The median in the South was $ 82,400, up 3.6 percent from September 1987. In the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, the price was $ 67,100, up 1.5 percent. The national appreciation rate over 12 months was 3.5 percent to a median of $ 88,500, meaning half of the homes sold for more and half for less.

<HEAD>47 New Heart Drugs In Works</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceutical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that 47 of its members companies are working on a total of 87 new drugs for cardiovascular diseases, including heart disease, hypertension and stroke. `` No other disease is targeted by so many drugs in development or so much investment in research,'' said association president <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mossinghoff </PERSON>. Each of the 87 drugs is either in human clinical trials or awaiting final approval by the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. He acknowledged at a news conference that one of the reasons the companies are pouring so much investment into cardiovascular diseases is that there remains a huge market for such therapies even though doctors now realize they are among the most preventable illnesses for people who adopt healthy lifestyles in their early and middle years. Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beary </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, senior vice president for science and technology for the trade association, noted that heart disease remains the nation's No. 1 killer and stroke No. 3. Even though the population is generally healthier, as well as older, than in years past, <PERSON> Beary </PERSON> said, `` At some point these diseases catch up with everyone.'' The <ORGANIZATION> PMA </ORGANIZATION> survey of its more than 100 members was designed to provide an overview of the scope of new drug development in various categories, rather than highlight any particularly promising `` breakthrough'' drugs. In fact, there are already a number of drugs on the market for cardiovascular diseases _ unlike for many other diseases that afflict mostly the elderly, such as Alzheimer's. <PERSON> Mossinghoff </PERSON> acknowledged that `` a subliminal purpose -LRB- for the press conference -RRB- is to let elder <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> know that it is important for the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> to have adequate funding'' to review these new drugs. `` This puts a little bit of pressure on the system,'' he said. <PERSON> Mossinghoff </PERSON> said it is likely some of the companies developing new cardiovascular disease drugs will take advantage of new <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> guidelines announced last week that holds out the prospect of quicker approval of new drugs if companies work closely with the agency in early clinical trials and make a larger research investment to accumulate more test data earlier than is often the current practice. The trade association plans similar surveys in December for cancer drugs under development and in January for arthritis, Alzheimer's and other aging diseases. The cardiovascular disease survey found more medicines being developed for hypertension, or high blood pressure, than any other condition with all but three of the 38 drugs in that category in the final stages of testing. The <ORGANIZATION> PMA </ORGANIZATION> said the second largest category is congestive heart failure, the final and often fatal phase of heart disease, with 28 drugs under development.

<TEXT>
 Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who attempted to use his power as governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> to block a National Guard training mission in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, lost an appeal Tuesday challenging federal authority over the guard. The 1st U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> issued a one-sentence order affirming a decision by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Keeton </PERSON> on May 6 that upheld federal supremacy over the guard. `` Having examined the briefs of the parties ... and having had the benefit of oral argument, we affirm the judgment on the basis stated in the district court's well-reasoned opinion,'' the appeals court said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> filed suit in January to block the assignment of 13 public relations specialists in the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> for two weeks in May because of his opposition to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration policies in the region. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has denounced during his presidential campaign the administration for its `` failed and illegal'' policy of supporting the Nicaraguan Contra rebels. He said sending <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> troops to the region was an attempt to intimidate <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who was campaigning Tuesday in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, had no immediate comment on the decision. After <PERSON> Keeton </PERSON> issued his ruling in May, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> appealed but he did not try to stop the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> troops from participating in the road-building exercises. <PERSON> Keeton </PERSON>'s decision upheld the constitutionality of the Montgomery Amendment, a 1986 act of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that says governors may not decline such assignments `` because of any objection to the location, purpose, type or schedule of such activity.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> described <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' position as `` a dagger aimed at the heart of national defense.'' The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' attorney general's office had claimed that the `` Militia Clause'' of the Constitution reserved power to the governors over training militia. <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON>, joined by <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and nine other states, challenged the law last year in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION> and lost. That case is now on appeal.

 Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> on Tuesday invited <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to resume their peace talks, and members of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> called on the nations to be more cooperative in the new talks. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said his invitation to resume talks on Monday in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> has been sent, but it was too early for a reply. Officials of both countries had expressed their willingness to resume talks before the end of the month in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> gave the members of the council a report Tuesday that brought out the urgency of a rapid troop withdrawal from the Iran-Iraq border, said the council's president, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Count </PERSON> <PERSON> York </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Wartenburg </PERSON>. The 15 Security Council members unanimously adopted a statement expressing their concern over the slow pace of the talks in September and early October, he said. The members `` express their expectation that substantive progress will be made in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in order to achieve a full and rapid implementation of Resolution 598 as an integral whole,'' said <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Wartenburg </PERSON>, referring to the council's peace plan. Observers interpreted the stress on implementing Resolution 598 as an `` integral whole'' as pressure on <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to give up its insistence that the <LOCATION> Shatt-al-Arab </LOCATION> waterway that form the southern border between the two nations must be cleared before the peace talks take up other issues. The waterway is <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s only navigable outlet to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, but it has been clogged with sunken ships and silt since the war broke out in 1980. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said that he and his special mediator for the talks, Swedish Ambassador <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eliasson </PERSON>, will go to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, but the secretary-general expects to stay only for four or five days. `` I am encouraged by the fact that both sides appear ready to show their goodwill by proceeding with some repatraition -LRB- of prisoners of war -RRB- in the near future,'' he said. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has suggested that all POWs could be sent home as a humanitarian gesture outside of the peace negotiations. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said the POW issue is one of the terms of the resolution and can not be separated from it, but Iranian Ambassador <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ja'afar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON> said last week his country is ready to reciprocate humanitarian gestures. <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON> suggested that sick and injured prisoners and those held the longest might be the first to be repatriated. Iranian and <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> sources have said both sides have accepted a compromise from the secretary-general to break the stalemate over the Shatt-al-Arab by postponing discussions of the issue until a later stage of the talks. The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has accepted <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s demand to stop searching ships for war material bound for <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The compromises would allow both sides to concentrate on negotiating the withdrawal of their troops to an internationally recognized border and the repatriation of POWs. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has not stopped any ships since Aug. 20, the day the U.N.-mediated cease-fire began.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> can not foster the ideal of racial equality given the underrepresentation of blacks among its faculty and administrators, says a report issued Tuesday by an organization of black staffers. Blacks make up 3 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> Ivy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> school's instructors and administrators, and the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faculty </ORGANIZATION> and Administrators called for increasing that figure to 10 percent. `` The challenge of overcoming the attachment to the beliefs and benefits of white supremacy remains,'' the association said in its report. The authors of the paper, titled `` The Final Report,'' used an unusual story-telling technique, hypothesizing what would happen if <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Bok </PERSON> and all of the school's black faculty and administrators were killed in an explosion. The outpouring of sympathy, they concluded, would mean that <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> `` would adopt a much more effective program for recruiting blacks to the school than now exists.'' <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, assistant dean of the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Graduate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Design </ORGANIZATION> and an association co-chair, said framing the report this way was intended to dramatize the group's message. `` The use of stories to make a point is a well-known African tradition, one that is increasingly used as a medium for scholarly discourse,'' <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said. `` It is our hope that the report's unusual character will prevent its becoming another forgotten report on affirmative action, a subject about which much more has been written than accomplished.'' The association said 17 of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>'s present 957 tenured faculty, or 1.8 percent, are black. Twenty-six of the 2,265 tenure-line faculty, or 1.1. percent, are black, and 155 of 3,205 administrators, or 4.8 percent, are black, it said In the imaginary scenario, an unnamed president would increase minority hiring by vigorous effort and, when those positions could not be filled, fund fellowships to help promising black students gain the credentials to teach at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> or other elite schools. `` We view this report as an incentive for a more detailed discussion and review with the deans of the university's 1988 Affirmative Action Plan,'' said association co-chair <PERSON> Derrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> professor. In noting that release of `` The Final Report'' comes 100 years after black educator and historian W.E.B. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Bois </PERSON>' admission to <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, the association said blacks still face prejudice at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>. `` The association's report noted that today, Dr. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Bois </PERSON> would find a substantial number of black students at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>. Most are spared the overt hostility that barred <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Bois </PERSON> from every social activity except the philosophy club. `` Even so, contemporary black students encounter color-based discrimination in many subtle and debilitating forms, and they suffer the no-less hurtful slights and disparaging assumptions about their abilities that <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Bois </PERSON> endured,'' it said.

<TEXT>
 A new 45-page handbook governing <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s bustling nightclubs has been adopted by the city's <ORGANIZATION> Licensing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, with provisions including bans on discriminatory admission practices and display of `` improper'' material. While some of the rules are good ideas, the restriction about what can be displayed could interfere with owners' rights to free expression, one civil liberties advocate said. <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s bustling and sometimes rowdy night scene prompted officials to draw up the compilation of rules and regulations, <ORGANIZATION> Licensing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairwoman <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> Gargiulo </PERSON> said Tuesday. The handbook, which clubs will be required to show to patrons on request, is easier to read than the fine print regulations on individual licenses issued to owners and will fit into police officers' pockets, Ms. <PERSON> Gargiulo </PERSON> said. The new rules prohibit signs such as `` Proper Dress Required,'' a vague stipulation that sometimes led to selective discrimination, Ms. <PERSON> Gargiulo </PERSON> said. Also banned are VIP passes on any basis that `` invidiously discriminates.'' `` We had cases where a white male with no tie was allowed in and a black male was told at the door that he could n't come in without a tie,'' Ms. <PERSON> Gargiulo </PERSON> said. `` We do n't want to leave it up to the doorman.'' New signs will have to spell out what constitutes proper dress, such as jacket and tie required for men, she said. Other new rules require that bouncers not strike customers unless hit first and makes nightclub owners responsible for the actions of valet parking companies they may hire. Waiting lines at popular nightspots will have to be limited and supervised. Penalties for violations include a wide variety of license restrictions, ranging from limits on the hours liquor can be served to outright suspension of a club's license. The ban on displaying material of an `` improper or objectionable nature'' in clubs outside the Combat Zone, the adult entertainment district, came under criticism from the <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. `` This is kind of a classic, so-called obscenity issue,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, the organization's executive director. `` We know that in this society, standards obviously differ between what's acceptable and not acceptable Somehow, female nudity in a lot of places is just sort of accepted, but now males is not.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Reinstein </PERSON>, a lawyer with the <ORGANIZATION> CLU </ORGANIZATION>, said the ban on improper material could be difficult to enforce. `` If I'm a restaurant owner with a statue of <PERSON> Michelangelo </PERSON>'s <PERSON> David </PERSON> in my place, is that covered because it's nudity?'' he said. Ms. <PERSON> Gargiulo </PERSON> said the rule is not intended to ban nude prints that hang inside some restaurants, but is aimed at material that is `` way out of line.'' The guideline on objectionable material will be whether it would be deemed unsuitable for view by members of the public if it were located in areas such as public parks or government and business offices. Enforcing the rules may be difficult, but not impossible, Ms. <PERSON> Gargiulo </PERSON> said. `` They're very subjective and that's why we hold hearings.''

<HEAD>Emperor Receives New Transfusion</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, suffering from internal bleeding, received more than a pint of blood Tuesday in his first transfusion in two days, the <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Household </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said. Before his transfusion, the 87-year-old monarch's blood pressure fell below 100, as it did Oct. 1, said agency spokesman <PERSON> Kenji </PERSON> <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON>. <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s blood pressure later recovered to 118 over 58 and his pulse declined to 108 beats a minute some 90 minutes later. His temperature was 100.4, compared with his normal reading of 95.9. The spokesman said the monarch was in stable condition and was sleeping well in the evening. The blood transfusion Tuesday brought to about 25 pints the total amount the emperor has received since his condition worsened Sept. 19. Court physicians believe the emperor has been bleeding from where he was operated on in September 1987 to bypass an intestinal blockage caused by an inflamed pancreas. The physicians have neither confirmed nor denied news reports that the emperor has cancer in his upper digestive system. Palace officials said <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> was visited separately by several members of the royal family, including <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> and his wife, Princess <PERSON> Michiko </PERSON>, and in the afternoon by <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> again.

 An <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> anti-pornography activist who was attacked in <ORGANIZATION> Hustler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION> as a sex-fearing `` crackpot'' and `` deluded busybody'' can not sue for libel because the statements were matters of opinion, a federal appeals court ruled Tuesday. Though the 1985 article about <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ault </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Milwaukie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, was `` disgusting and distasteful abuse'' and `` a grievous assault to her human dignity,'' it contained no statements of fact that could be the basis of a libel suit, said the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. The 3-0 ruling also rejected claims of invasion of privacy and intentional infliction of emotional distress. It reversed a federal judge's order to Ms. <ORGANIZATION> Ault </ORGANIZATION> to pay Hustler $ 5,365 in legal fees for a frivolous suit, saying the legal claims were `` not wholly unreasonable.'' `` This case is a good sign for us,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>, a lawyer for the magazine. He said several similar suits are pending, mostly filed by lawyer <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, whose law firm represented Ms. <PERSON> Ault </PERSON>. <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> has also sued Hustler for libel because of the magazine's satiric attack on him for his other suits, <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> said. `` We're hopeful that in light of this ruling, some of the other lawsuits that Mr. <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> has filed with similar claims might be thrown out of court,'' <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> said. He also cited last year's <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling rejecting a suit against Hustler by television preacher <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>, who was the subject of a sexual parody in the magazine. Lawyers for Ms. <PERSON> Ault </PERSON> did not return phone calls Tuesday. Ms. <PERSON> Ault </PERSON> founded a group called Citizens in Action for <LOCATION> Clackamas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, to protest a sex video store in <LOCATION> Milwaukie </LOCATION>, and has lobbied for anti-pornography legislation through another group. Her suit involved an April 1985 Hustler article that was illustrated by her photograph superimposed over the rear end of a bent-over naked man. In the article, the magazine called Ms. <ORGANIZATION> Ault </ORGANIZATION>'s local organization a `` wacko group'' engaged in censorship and intimidation. It also described her as `` frustrated,'' `` threatened by sex,'' a `` fanatic'' and `` crackpot,'' and a `` deluded busybody'' in need of professional help.

<HEAD>Builders' Group Say Energy Efficient Homes Won't Add to Radon

<TEXT>
 A major builders' association on Tuesday said it has found no evidence that energy-efficient homes increase radon concentrations and that it is advising its members to build homes as tight as possible. `` Our practices recommend good air sealing techniques,'' just as would be used in trying to save energy, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Spears </PERSON>, program manager for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, which is affiliated with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Builders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Some analysts have suggested that the increasing importance being placed on energy efficiency also may be increasing the tendency of radon, an odorless, radioactive gas given off by all soils, to concentrate indoors. The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> has warned that although increased ventilation may help particular radon-rich homes, as a general rule well-ventilated homes appear to have no exemption from radon buildup. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> estimates that radon could be causing as many as 20,000 deaths from lung cancer each year. In September, the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> issued a national health advisory warning of radon dangers and the two agencies urged testing of every home where people live on the second floor or below. As for home sealing, `` We're finding it has little to do with radon,'' <PERSON> Spears </PERSON> said at a news conference. As a result, the association is recommending `` the same practices we have recommended for years for energy conservation. In fact, we've found that energy conservation has little to do with radon concentration in the house. We've measured houses all over the country.'' The association recommended many techniques for reducing radon buildup, such as carefully sealing off the basement _ often the same techniques used for keeping water out. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ethier </PERSON>, litigation counsel for the association, said members were being advised that `` if they make a reasoned judgment that there may be high radon levels,'' that they should `` rough in'' mitigation techniques such as under-slab ventilation pipes that may be ignored later if appropriate, or connected to a fan to divert radon-laden air around the basement. In states such as <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> with well-publicized instances of radon buildup, <PERSON> Ethier </PERSON> said he has found `` universal'' adoption of such precautions by builders. Builders report that the techniques may add as little as $ 100 to the cost of a home, if water barriers are already being used, but as much as $ 600 if they are not, he said.

<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION> cadet was abducted by a group of masked students who shaved his head in an attack that apparently was sparked by an ice-throwing incident at a football game, school officials said Tuesday. `` I think it's some overzealous behavior on the part of some students who acted with malice,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodale </PERSON>, vice president for student affairs. One of the eight to 10 students accused of abducting and injuring <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodberry </PERSON>, 19, of <LOCATION> Nokesville </LOCATION>, has been arrested. More arrests are expected, <PERSON> Goodale </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Woodberry </PERSON> was listed in stable condition with a bruised brain at <ORGANIZATION> Roanoke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. Jennings Cole II, 19, of <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION>, faces charges of abduction, hazing and malicious wounding, school officials said. All the students involved are believed to be members of the <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cadets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tighty </ORGANIZATION> band, but the university does not hold the corps responsible, <PERSON> Goodale </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Goodale </PERSON> said he did not consider the incident to have been hazing, but rather `` a personal matter between students.'' <PERSON> Goodale </PERSON> said the attack occurred in the early morning hours Thursday when the students wearing ski masks knocked on <PERSON> Woodberry </PERSON>'s door, abducted him and took him to a campus duck pond where they shaved his head with an electric razor The episode appeared to have been thoroughly plotted, with some students standing guard, <PERSON> Goodale </PERSON> said. The attack was broken up when <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tech </LOCATION> police on a routine patrol came along, he said. One of the students' ski masks was removed, leading to <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>'s arrest Monday, he said. <PERSON> Woodberry </PERSON> was initially treated on campus and released Friday. He participated in a field exercise that day but was taken to <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday when other students became concerned about a bad headache he had. The attack apparently was prompted by an ice-throwing incident at the <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> football game on Oct. 1, <PERSON> Goodale </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Woodberry </PERSON> has since left the band.

The health chief cited the special danger of injecting drugs intravenously. `` Sharing contaminated needles is like playing Russian Roulette with the AIDS virus,'' said <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON>. `` Intravenous drug abusers now make up more than a quarter of all cases of AIDS diagnosed thus far.'' <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> called on parents to take the lead in fighting drugs with some specific advice: _ `` Education your children about the dangers of illicit drug use. Share with them information about the health impact of drug use and teach them how to just say no. _ `` Watch for the early warning signs _ dropping grades, behavior change, stolen money or missing items of value. - `` Provide positive alternatives for your children. When children have nothing interesting to motivate them, then they may be tempted to turn to drugs. _ `` Personally remain drug free. Many children learn about drug use from their parents. If you have a problem, find treatment. _ `` Help make your neighborhood and work-site drug free. If you know someone who has a problem, whether in your neighborhood or at work, help them to get help. You may be their last, best hope.''

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION> and 12 individuals must pay about $ 1 million to 53 civil rights marchers who were pelted with rocks and bottles during a demonstration in virtually all-white <LOCATION> Forsyth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, according to a verdict unsealed Tuesday. The activists marched into the county north of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> on Jan. 17, 1987, and were attacked by counter-demonstrators, many of them <ORGANIZATION> KKK </ORGANIZATION> members or sympathizers. Named as defendants in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> lawsuit were the Southern White Knights of the <ORGANIZATION> KKK </ORGANIZATION>, the Invisible Empire Knights of the KK and 12 individuals. The jury reached its verdict Oct. 5, but Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moye </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> ordered it sealed to give marchers who brought the lawsuit time to decide whether to join <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> City Councilman <PERSON> Hosea </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who wanted to drop the lawsuit. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who helped organize the march and was among those who filed suit, urged toward the end of the trial that the lawsuit be dropped because it would impoverish the families of <ORGANIZATION> KKK </ORGANIZATION> members. In a letter to those who filed with him, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said he had talked to slain civil rights leader <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and that <PERSON> King </PERSON> told him `` <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> wanted him not to sue the Klan.'' He and three other defendants dropped out. State Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON>, who had opposed <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' move to drop the lawsuit, said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' `` religion and communication with the dead should not interfere with our constitutional rights and justice.'' The award gave $ 50 each to the marchers in general damages. The rest was in punitive damages. The lawsuit had sought $ 1.5 million. The two Klan organizations were fined $ 400,000 each. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Holland </PERSON>, Grand Dragon of the White Knights, was fined $ 50,000. Individual fines ranged from $ 30,000 to $ 1,000, except for <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmour </PERSON>, who was judged not to be liable and was not fined. The `` brotherhood march'' was a forerunner to a larger demonstration a week later in which an estimated 24,000 persons turned out. State, local, county and federal troops were called out to protect the marchers and to prevent violence. A march into the county a year ago commemorating the anniversary of the 1987 marches was peaceful.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> will open its main oil port to foreign vessels as it pulls its own tankers out of service from the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> route heavily attacked during its war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, shipping sources said Tuesday. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> will eliminate service by Iranian-operated tankers from <LOCATION> Kharg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in the northeastern gulf to the <LOCATION> Sirri </LOCATION> terminal in the south by the end of the year, according to the London-based <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION>, which monitors maritime traffic It quoted <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Souri </PERSON>, chairman and managing director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iranian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tanker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, as saying he expected foreign tankers to take over the transport of half of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s oil exports from <LOCATION> Kharg </LOCATION> within a month and all of it within two months. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> imposed an air and sea blockade around <LOCATION> Kharg </LOCATION> in 1984, a move that triggered the tanker war in which more than 500 ships were attacked by both countries. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is exporting an estimated 1.4 million barrels of oil a day. Officials have said they plan to increase their long-term export capacity to around 4.5 million barrels a day. The <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> report underlined Iranian efforts to restore normal oil export operations following the Aug. 20 cease-fire in the 8-year-old war between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Gulf-based shipping officials reported earlier this month the Iranians had stopped exercising their legal right to stop vessels suspected of carrying war-related cargoes to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. They also reported that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has withdrawn all its armed speedboats from the southern gulf island of <LOCATION> Abu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Musa </LOCATION> island, which was used as a base from which to attack neutral ships in reprisal for Iraqi air raids on tankers carrying Iranian oil. The last Iranian attack was a speedboat raid on a Norwegian tanker on Aug. 4 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s shipowners and maritime union Tuesday lifted a ban it imposed last year to keep its ships from sailing to <LOCATION> Kharg </LOCATION>. A shipping source who requested anonymity said there were unconfirmed reports that a Japanese tanker had already loaded at <LOCATION> Kharg </LOCATION> and left the gulf. Shipments from <LOCATION> Kharg </LOCATION> account for 90 percent of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s oil exports, which made the port a target of repeated <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> air raids aimed at strangling the oil sales that financed <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s war effort. <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Souri </PERSON> as saying negotiations are under way to return some of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s 17 chartered oil vessels to international service, a move expected to depress the tanker market. At the peak of the war, the Iranians had a shuttle fleet of more than 30 tankers, many of them charters, because foreign vessels would not risk Iraqi attacks to reach <LOCATION> Kharg </LOCATION>. Gulf-based shipping executives said the 547,841-ton <ORGANIZATION> Burmah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endeavor </ORGANIZATION>, which was used as a storage vessel for crude oil shipped from <LOCATION> Kharg </LOCATION>, was in the southern gulf port of <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> for reconversion to sea duty. The British-flagged supertanker was damaged in an Iraqi air raid in May. <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> said that disbanding <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s tanker service would save <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> an estimated $ 300 million a year. <LOCATION> Kharg </LOCATION> and its tankers were bombed scores of times by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s air force and the port was heavily fortified with anti-aircraft and missile batteries. The Iranians tried to circumvent the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> blockade by installing a makeshift terminal at <LOCATION> Sirri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, about 350 miles south. Foreign tankers loaded there until the Iraqis raided <LOCATION> Sirri </LOCATION> in 1986. Loading operations were then moved another 120 miles south to <LOCATION> Larak </LOCATION> island in the <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>, the gateway to the gulf. But Iraqi warplanes began hitting <PERSON> Larak </PERSON> as well, culminating in a May 14 strike in which several supertankers were sunk or crippled. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> severely damaged the Sirri platform on April 18 in retaliatory raids for the mining of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship. Since the cease-fire, <ORGANIZATION> Sirri </ORGANIZATION>'s terminal has reopened, shipping officials said, while <PERSON> Larak </PERSON> has ceased to function as an oil terminal.

 Two sisters who work on an assembly line produced the winning ticket Tuesday to a Lotto jackpot worth more than $ 31.5 million and said they would split the prize. `` We always go in together,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Snipes </PERSON>.

Amro at first demanded that the issue of child custody be decided by Islamic laws rather than <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> courts, and he later said he should be freed from jail because there was nothing he could do to gain return of the child. <PERSON> Amro </PERSON> sent his son to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> two years ago to live with <ORGANIZATION> Amro </ORGANIZATION>'s sister after <PERSON> Amro </PERSON> was convicted of beating his wife Ms. <PERSON> Mejdouli </PERSON> later divorced him and won custody of the child. Amro, a computer engineering student at <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, contended that his father, a devout Moslem, refused to allow the boy to return, but his plea to overturn the indefinite jail confinement was denied by the <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's no place for a human being,'' <PERSON> Amro </PERSON> said Tuesday of his jail stay, but said he made the right decision about his son. `` I wanted him to be away while there was a dispute between myself and his mother. He probably would have been psychologically ruined'' if he had witnessed the dispute, <PERSON> Amro </PERSON> said. He said he intended for the boy to be away only for a month or two. He said the grandfather changed his mind when he was told of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s decision. <PERSON> Amro </PERSON> said he has been a permanent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> resident for five years and has applied for citizenship. <PERSON> Amro </PERSON> said he wants to finish the semester of school needed for his bachelor's degree, and will seek visitation rights. `` I do n't want to be a part-time dad. I want to always be there for my son when he needs me,'' <PERSON> Amro </PERSON> said. `` I want to see him as much as I can. I want to be involved in his life.'' `` Oh, yeah,'' retorted Ms. <PERSON> Mejdouli </PERSON> in a separate interview. `` That's why he sent him overseas for two years. We do n't trust him. That's the same game he played with us two years ago.'' A visitation hearing has been set in <LOCATION> Seiser </LOCATION>'s court for Thursday morning.

 A small task force of Soviet warships is making its way toward <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> in what appears to be a routine deployment, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. The task force is led by a Udaloy-class guided-missile destroyer and includes at least two other vessels _ a Krivak-class guided-missile frigate and an Olekma-class replenishment oiler, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> statement said. If normal procedures are being followed, however, those three surface ships are being accompanied by a diesel-powered submarine, it added. The group, now steaming in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> south of <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION>, should arrive in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> before the end of the week. `` Two Soviet Bear-D reconnaissance aircraft and two Bear-F anti-submarine warfare aircraft arrived in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> last week, and may participate in exercises with the Soviet surface ships,'' the Pentagon said. The deployment of Soviet warships to the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> is not unusual, although this is the first such movement in two years. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, it is the 27th such operation conducted by the Soviets since 1969. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces will maintain surveillance of the ships, particularly if they move into the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> for exercises, the Pentagon said.

<HEAD>Public Housing Tenants to Buy Own Apartments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The tenants of a public housing development in a poverty-stricken, drug-laden neighborhood took the first step Tuesday toward buying the housing project. `` This is a dream becoming reality,'' said community activist <PERSON> Kimi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Kenilworth-Parkside </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which received final approval for its bid to purchase the 464 apartments from the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> city government for $ 1. `` We've worked six years for this.'' After the complex is renovated, in several years, residents will be able to buy their apartments for as little as $ 10,000 each. The occasion marked the first instance in history in which public housing tenants arranged to buy their own apartments. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> organized the tenant corporation, which took over management of the project in 1982, reducing administrative costs by 60 percent. Before that, when it had been managed by a private firm under contract to the city, it was rat-infested and run down. Apartments had no heat or hot water; the chain link fence was squashed and rusted. `` We have a vested interest,'' explained <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> in an interview at the time. `` We live here, so we really care. We're supersensitive.'' The sale to the tenants was made possible through a 1987 law authorizing the conversion of several public housing projects across the country to tenant ownership to demonstrate whether the idea was feasible. The actual sale will not take effect until after the completion of a $ 23 million federally financed renovation of the 33-building complex. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> also will provide $ 6 million in rental assistance over the next five years. The tenants corporation plans to help tenants increase their incomes so they can afford to buy their apartments, said <PERSON> Alphonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, director of the city's <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assisted </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION>. So far, 132 residents have been removed from welfare rolls as result of the corporation's `` entrepreneurial ventures,'' such as a day care center and janitorial service, he said.

 A man who identified himself as a born-again <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> rode his converted school bus early Tuesday into the lobby of a theater where he had viewed the controversial film, `` The Last Temptation of Christ,'' police said. <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Watin </PERSON>, 49, of Etna, was charged with second-degree criminal mischief, a felony, said <LOCATION> Ithaca </LOCATION> Police Sgt. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>. <PERSON> Watin </PERSON> pronounced himself guilty during his arraignment before Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON>, who ordered <PERSON> Watin </PERSON> held in the county jail in lieu of $ 5,000 cash or $ 10,000 bail bond. <PERSON> Watin </PERSON>, a car salesman, turned himself in to authorities after driving his bus into the front lobby of Fall Creek Pictures around 6:10 a.m. The impact knocked down a supporting beam inside the theater, causing portions of the ceiling to fall. The theater's large, plate-glass windows were shattered and broken glass was scattered throughout the lobby, said owner <PERSON> Tsvi </PERSON> <PERSON> Bokaer </PERSON> <PERSON> Bokaer </PERSON> said <PERSON> Watin </PERSON> watched the <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scorsese </PERSON> film Sunday night and had to be removed by police after shouting profanities before and during the movie.

<HEAD>Building Collapse Blamed on Illegal Repairs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An illegal repair job was blamed Tuesday for the collapse of a six-story building that crumbled like a house of cards, killing one person and injuring about 12 others. The owner of the building in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s Garment District died when one wall fell away and the interior floors tumbled to the ground Monday afternoon. One survivor, <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>, 27, of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, underwent surgery Tuesday to repair damage to her crushed legs. <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>, who apparently was working on the sixth floor of the building, was pulled from the rubble more than eight hours later when rescuers heard her say, `` I'm <PERSON> Robin </PERSON>. Get me out.'' Police and investigators from the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> district attorney's office examined the wreckage Tuesday as emergency crews continued to dismantle what remained of the building `` So far there's been no one arrested,'' said <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Montealegre </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> District Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgenthau </PERSON>. `` We're still in the process of finding out if there's any criminal liability.'' The building was owned by <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> DeSantis </PERSON>, 64, whose body was pulled from the rubble late Monday night. Buildings Commissioner <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said <PERSON> DeSantis </PERSON> had apparently hired a contractor to repair the building after he noticed a bulge in its western wall. As workers began to remove old sections of the wall to repair it, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said, `` bricks started popping out.'' Then, he said, the workers dug a trench along the wall and tried to shore it up with wooden planks. `` That did n't do any good and probably -LRB- did -RRB- more harm,'' the commissioner said. `` Shortly after that, the wall collapsed.'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said he did n't know why the contractor, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Varkaris </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> JRV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, dug the ditch. <PERSON> Varkaris </PERSON> did not immediately return a message left Tuesday on an answering machine at his home. A man who answered the telephone Tuesday at <PERSON> DeSantis </PERSON>' office declined to discuss the incident. `` We're taking no calls and making no comments,'' he said. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said the work was similar to that being done at a five-story building in <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> that collapsed last November, trapping five residents and killing a 13-month-old boy. In both cases, he said, the work was being done without permits.

<HEAD>NY Court Rules Random Urine Testing of Elite Police Force Legal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BAUDER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Random urine testing for drugs among an elite corps of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> police officers is legal because of the dangerous and sensitive nature of their work, a divided <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state Court of Appeals ruled Tuesday. The 5-2 decision by the state's top court not only overturns two lower court rulings, it constitutes an `` about face'' for a court which only last year ruled that a drug-testing plan for <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> teachers was an unreasonable invasion of their privacy, the dissenting judges said. The court decision upholds <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>'s 1986 order that members of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Organized </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> must undergo random urinalysis for drugs Approximately 1,100 of the city's 27,000 police officers volunteer for duty in the special unit. Up to 90 percent are involved in narcotics-related work. `` The terror-filled world they are working in requires the sternest precautionary safeguards to weed out drug abusers from their own ranks,'' wrote Judge <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellacosa </PERSON> for the majority. The court ruled unanimously last year in a case involving <LOCATION> Patchogue </LOCATION> teachers that governments could n't force public employees to take drug tests unless there is a `` reasonable suspicion'' that workers are using drugs. Much of <PERSON> Bellacosa </PERSON>'s 14-page ruling was taken up with an explanation of why the police officers should be held to stricter standards than the teachers. The lower courts incorrectly gave an `` absolutist reading'' to the <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>' decision in the teachers' case, he said. The `` direct correlation'' between an organized crime officer's work and drugs should be considered in evaluating the extent of their constitutional rights to privacy, <PERSON> Bellacosa </PERSON> wrote `` The officers agree to undergo microscopic examinations of their personal lives, their financial affairs and their professional judgment calls,'' <PERSON> Bellacosa </PERSON> said. `` Realistically, the proposed random drug testing in these narrow circumstances is just another layer of an already heightened, persistent and employee-expected scrutiny.'' Judge <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaye </PERSON>, in a dissenting opinion, said the government has n't established why the testing is needed or why the officers should be held to such special standards. `` The public clearly has an interest in the integrity of every employee who serves it,'' <PERSON> Kaye </PERSON> wrote. `` Equally clearly, that alone does not give the state the power to conduct intrusive searches of their person.'' According to court papers, all city police recruits are tested for drugs when they apply to the department, again during their five-month police academy training and at the end of their 18-month probation. Tenured officers are subject to testing if there's a reasonable suspicion of drug use. Officers applying to the organized crime unit were required by <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> in 1986 to sign a form acknowledging that periodic drug testing was a condition of employment. The policemen's union, the Patrolmen's <ORGANIZATION> Benevolent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, sued to overturn the order two days after it was announced. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerno </PERSON>, the union's lawyer, said he was surprised at the decision. He called the drug testing an `` excessive attempt'' to solve a problem that does n't really exist. The decision gives new life to municipalities who hope to start drug testing programs, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Adler </PERSON>, a lawyer in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s corporation counsel's office. The city in late 1987 tried to institute random drug testing for all corrections officers, he said. But lower courts have struck down the program, citing the <LOCATION> Patchogue </LOCATION> case, he said. `` I think certainly those who might favor drug testing are probably better equipped to make a legal argument justifying the testing than they had before this decision came down,'' <PERSON> Adler </PERSON> said. According to police department records, narcotics-related disciplinary charges have been filed against 10 police officers in the crime unit in four years. <PERSON> Kaye </PERSON> said these statistics show there's no indication of a drug abuse problem within this unit. `` The important goal of deterrence ... is not, without evidence of a pervasive problem among the persons to be tested, justification for this search,'' she said.

 The defiant director of a fundamentalist children's home and two assistants were indicted by a state grand jury Tuesday in connection with a June confrontation with law enforcement officers. The Rev. <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON>, 38, and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldino </PERSON>, 25, were indicted on three counts each of felonious assault on a law enforcement officer, while two counts were lodged against 18-year-old <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Reining </PERSON>. A Friday arraignment hearing in <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> was set for the three. Fountain and his assistants are accused of assaulting law officers who stormed the <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> Home for Children on June 13 and took custody of allegedly abused and neglected youth. The unlicensed school is operated by the independent <ORGANIZATION> Bethel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. The indictments were handed down by a <LOCATION> George </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> grand jury that went into session Monday. Fountain and the two assistants drove to the <LOCATION> George </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Courthouse </LOCATION> after they were notified by Circuit Clerk <PERSON> Wilbur </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> about the indictments and they were allowed to remain free on bonds that were posted after the confrontation. Fountain has been free on $ 40,000 bond, <PERSON> Baldino </PERSON> on $ 20,000 bond and Reining on $ 10,000 bond. `` I do n't feel like they're after me, I feel like they're after the church,'' <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON> said when he arrived at the courthouse. County Prosecutor <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Maples </PERSON> was in court Tuesday and unavailable for comment. Fountain, who has claimed to be a former heroin addict and witchcraft practitioner, has said he had as many as 120 children living at his 28-acre compound outside <LOCATION> Lucedale </LOCATION>. He claims his right to freedom of religion exempts him from any state oversight, but a <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge, looking into allegations of beatings and other abuse, ordered the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> last June to take custody of the <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> residents. Some state law officers have accused Fountain of ordering the children to flee the compound. Fountain denies the allegation. It took officials several days to round up the children. The minister is accused of punching law officers after they stormed the locked church in search of the children. Several witnesses, including reporters, saw Fountain swing at lawmen. The minister has appealed a separate disorderly conduct conviction in justice court. He has been fined $ 200 for the charge, which also stems from the June 13 incident. His initial circuit court appearance in the appeal is scheduled for Oct. 31.

 <ORGANIZATION> Castleberry </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, is voluntarily recalling 51,985 cans of corned beef hash in six states because 912 cans did not go through the required heat processing, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday.

Officials said the suspected corn beef could contain food poisoning organisms, including some that could cause botulism, a deadly form of poisoning. The product, <PERSON> Castleberry </PERSON>'s Single Serve Canned Corned Beef Hash, is packaged in 7 -LCB- - ounce cans with pull tabs and is sold mostly in vending machines A small percentage of the product is sold also in convenience and grocery stores. The products are identified by the code numbers 2J81CBV3 or 2J81CBV4 on the bottom of the cans. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> inspection mark shows Est. 195. `` Although no illnesses have been reported, we strongly urge consumers to avoid tasting the products and to return them immediately to the establishment where they were purchased,'' said <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, administrator of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>.

Among these organisms may be Clostridium botulinum, which causes botulism, which was described in the announcement as `` a serious form of food poisoning.'' Other literature published by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>, however, calls botulism `` an extremely deadly form of food poisoning.''

She succeeded her husband, <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Peron </PERSON>, when he died in 1974. But her sympathies appear to lie more with President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> of the Radical Civic Union than with the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lesio </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON>, secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Meatpackers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` The unexpected arrival of Mrs. <PERSON> Peron </PERSON> is very strange. We understand she was invited by the national government. I hope she does n't intend to involve herself with our -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- movement.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is divided among supporters of presidential candidate <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>, the front-runner and governor of the poor province of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rioja </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cafiero </PERSON>. Last weekend, <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> said his party might try to impeach <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> `` because of the perverse political economy applied by the national government.'' <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> is barred by the constitution from seeking re-election. The <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> candidate for president is <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Angeloz </PERSON>, the governor of prosperous <LOCATION> Cordoba </LOCATION> province. Mrs. <PERSON> Peron </PERSON>'s visit is her third since <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> was inaugurated president in December 1983. The previous two visits were at <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>'s invitation. Mrs. <PERSON> Peron </PERSON>'s turbulent 20 months in office were marked by kidnappings and assassinations conducted by left - and right-wing political extremists, and an economic collapse Mrs. <PERSON> Peron </PERSON> was elected vice-president in the 1973 election her husband won by a landslide after returning to Argentine politics from an eighteen-year exile in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Peron </PERSON> was elected president in 1946 and re-elected in 1951. He was overthrown by the military in 1955. He met <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Estela </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, known as Isabel, at a night club in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> after the 1955 coup. She became his secretary and followed him to <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, where she became his third wife.

 A man who shot his wife last summer in a struggle over whether to kill the family dog received a suspended jail sentence after his spouse said the incident had strengthened their marriage. <PERSON> Danelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickelman </PERSON>, 27, of rural <PERSON> Horace </PERSON>, asked East Central District Judge <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothe </PERSON> for leniency for her husband, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, during <PERSON> Dickelman </PERSON>'s sentencing Tuesday on a conviction for reckless endangerment. <PERSON> Dickelman </PERSON>, 31, who spent five days in jail after the shooting last June, had suffered enough, Mrs. <PERSON> Dickelman </PERSON> told the judge. <PERSON> Dickelman </PERSON> had been drinking and was intent on shooting the family dog when the incident occurred, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Goff </PERSON>, an assistant <LOCATION> Cass </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> state's attorney. The dog had angered Dickelman because of its habit of urinating on the carpet in their home, the prosecutor said. Mrs. <PERSON> Dickelman </PERSON> struggled with her husband before he shot her with a .22 - caliber pistol, <PERSON> Goff </PERSON> Mrs. <PERSON> Dickelman </PERSON> told the judge at Tuesday's sentencing that the shooting was an accident. The pistol was loaded with birdshot, and Mrs. <PERSON> Dickelman </PERSON> suffered pellet wounds in her mouth. She has since recovered, according to <PERSON> Goff </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Dickelman </PERSON> said the incident had prompted her husband to seek help for a drinking problem, and that the couple `` were trying to turn this ... into a positive thing,'' <PERSON> Goff </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Rothe </PERSON> sentenced <PERSON> Dickelman </PERSON> to a year in jail for the misdemeanor and then suspended all but the five days he had served and placed him on two years' probation. The judge said <PERSON> Dickelman </PERSON> must refrain from drinking, using drugs or handling firearms during his probation and also must perform 200 hours of community service work.

<HEAD>Commission Finds Firing of Coach Racially Motivated</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSFIELD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Discrimination </ORGANIZATION> has found that the 1985 firing of the only black coach in the <ORGANIZATION> Pittsfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Little </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> was racially motivated. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> filed a complaint with the state commission after he was dismissed as coach of the <ORGANIZATION> Connor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmacy </ORGANIZATION> team in June 1985 following a series of disputes with league officials. Among other things, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> contended that league Umpire-In-Chief <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Stannard </PERSON> had called him `` boy'' in a `` racially and personally derogatory manner in the course of a game.'' At the time, the league of six teams had no black players, according to the commission. Each team has at least one coach, all of whom serve for free, according to league Secretary-Treasurer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Marchesi </PERSON>. Following its finding, the state commission attempted to mediate the dispute between <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and the league, but no conclusion was reached in a three-hour meeting Monday, said <PERSON> Rosemary </PERSON> <PERSON> Nevins </PERSON>, commission staff council. She said that if no agreement could be worked out privately between the parties, the commission could hold public hearings. After that the issue could be decided by the courts. The main sticking point, according to <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> was the wording of an apology he sought from league officials. He said that he had never sought monetary compensation from the league but wanted the apology to boost his chances of seeking other coaching jobs. `` If there is a statement to be issued,'' he said. `` I just want it to clarify that I'm not the troublemaker some people might make me out to be. This is n't a situation I created.'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who works as a wireman at <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, had previously coached junior varsity baseball at <ORGANIZATION> Lee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> and junior varsity girls basketball at <ORGANIZATION> Taconic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pittsfield </LOCATION>. He had initially filed a civil suit against the league over his dismissal in 1985, but withdrew the action in favor of pursuing a complaint through the commission. `` I could n't afford to co through the courts,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. He said the cost of the complaint was about half that of a civil suit.

<HEAD>Nation's Cartoonists Mount Comic-Page Campaign for the Homeless</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA BARNAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s cartoonists used their pens to skewer disdain and apathy toward the homeless in a concerted campaign on the comic pages Tuesday. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sluggo </PERSON> played `` homeless couple,'' a homeless man offered to share his meal of popcorn with <PERSON> Ziggy </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Marmaduke </PERSON> befriended homeless dogs. `` The whole purpose of this is to draw attention to the plight of the homeless, to make people aware that something needs to be done,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON>, a syndicated <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> cartoonist who was one of more than 100 comic-strip and editorial cartoonists to participate in the project. `` The wealthy can afford lobbying groups. I feel the purpose of the cartoonist is to help those who ca n't afford a lobby,'' said Day, who drew a prosperous, well-fed Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> gazing in the mirror and seeing a gaunt-faced version of himself labeled the homeless, holding his coat together at the neck. There are no official counts of the number of homeless, but national estimates range from 350,000 to more than 3 million, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Low </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Income </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, an organizer of the project. Some of the artists got their messages across through humor, others used irony or exaggeration. Some of the cartoons were political: taking aim at the presidential campaign or <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> posturing. <PERSON> Garry </PERSON> <PERSON> Trudeau </PERSON>'s `` Doonesbury'' simply focused on the humanity of a panhandling couple, <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Elmont </LOCATION>. When a tired <LOCATION> Elmont </LOCATION> mistakes his wife for a rival on his corner, he apologizes by explaining he mistook her for `` some gorgeous hooker,'' and she goes off pleased. Other cartoonists relied on the naivete of outsiders, be they children or observers from a different time like <PERSON> Hagar </PERSON> the Viking. <PERSON> Dik </PERSON> <PERSON> Browne </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hagar </PERSON>'s creator, has his hero and his wife in front of a fortune teller, who predicts, `` One day, millions of people will be homeless, and millions of others who could easily help will just turn away.'' Responds the fierce Viking: `` And they call ME horrible.'' In the `` Middletons,'' by <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunagin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Summers </PERSON>, a child watches as his mother puts change in a street person's cup. After she explains the man is homeless and the money is for food, the youngster says, `` Gosh, he'd get more to eat if I gave him my trick-or-treat bag.'' Some of the cartoons had a distinctly political cast, partisan or not. In <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Guisewaite </PERSON>'s `` <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON>,'' her mom is shown listening to a campaign speech and getting more and more agitated at the politician's rhetoric. Finally, when he declares that he'll invest in a strong defense to keep the country safe for the homeless, she explodes, telling him to go to bed without dinner and announcing: `` This country does n't need a president. It needs a mother.'' The <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Bensen </PERSON> contributed an editorial cartoon showing a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> figure sitting on a heating grate in sidewalk in front of the White House with a shopping cart filled with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and other campaign signs. Above the drawing it says: `` Cartoonist Homeless Prject. He's a painful reminder of what's wrong with <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> _ abandoned, homeless, living on the streets. Let's keep him that way.'' Below the drawing, it says, `` Vote <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> Nov. 8th.'' But some cartoonists were able to find a touch of humor, like <PERSON> Mell </PERSON> <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON> of `` Momma.'' In that strip, <PERSON> Momma </PERSON>'s son raids her refrigerator because he does n't have any food at his apartment. <PERSON> Momma </PERSON> tells him, `` <PERSON> Francis </PERSON>, do you realize there are people in this country who are totally homeless, while you have two of them?'' `` If a kid tells his parents, ` Hey look. All the comics are about homeless people today,' we will at least have raised their consciousness,'' <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON> said.

 <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> struggled Tuesday to recover from a hurricane that killed at least 60 people and left 300,000 homeless in this Central American nation. Help poured in from a dozen countries. Floods and strong winds heavily damaged crops throughout <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Hurricane Joan killed another 63 people elsewhere in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> _ 23 in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, four in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, 25 in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and 11 in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> _ before it crossed <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and was reborn Monday in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> as Tropical Storm <PERSON> Miriam </PERSON>. At 5 p.m. EDT Tuesday, an advisory from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> National Hurricane Center in <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, said the storm had weakened to a tropical depression with maximum sustained winds of about 35 mph. It said the storm was centered near latitude 13.8 north, longitude 94.3 west, or about 180 miles south-southeast of <LOCATION> Salina </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. It said the storm was moving west at about 9 mph. Public Safety Minister <PERSON> Reynaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Tefel </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s national emergency committee, told diplomats in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> that the hurricane death toll had risen by 10, to 60, in a country already battered by seven years of civil war. Officials worked to restore power and water in the capital. Public buses and trucks were pressed into service to take evacuees home. No public transport was operating between <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> and the rest of the country. Nationwide, only about 40 percent of public transport was running. The official <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nicaragua </ORGANIZATION> radio broadcast pleas for money and goods for the 38,000 residents of storm-wrecked <LOCATION> Bluefields </LOCATION> and other hard-hit <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> areas such as nearby <LOCATION> Corn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. `` Paradise in Ruins,'' the official <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <PERSON> Barricada </PERSON> said in a headline over the first photographs from the island. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> said it was giving $ 17,000 to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s national emergency committee. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> donated $ 140,000 and offered $ 500,000 worth of technical assistance. The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> offered $ 100,000 to help the homeless. The French medical group, Doctors Without Borders, said a 16-member medical team and 17 tons of supplies would arrive in <LOCATION> Bluefields </LOCATION> on Wednesday. <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and private humanitarian groups in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> promised to send medical personnel and supplies. Relief supplies from <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> were already being distributed. The White House said Monday it did n't expect a request for help. When specifically asked, however, President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> said this country would accept <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hurricane aid if it were offered without conditions. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> previously said the best aid the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could offer would be to stop supporting the rebels, known as Contras. The government estimates its 7-year-old war with the Contras has caused damage worth $ 12 billion. In <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> said the discovery of two drowning victims near the border with <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> pushed the storm death toll there to 23. He reckoned damage at $ 62 million and said the hurricane flooded 75 towns, destroyed 1,500 homes, damaged six hospitals and ruined banana, coffee, rice and bean crops. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> told a news conference that <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, a nation of 2.5 million people, would need international help to recover. `` Places like <LOCATION> Neilly </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Cortes </PERSON>, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeledon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Palmar </PERSON> <PERSON> Norte </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dominical </PERSON> and Parrita are cut off,'' he reported.

 Saying <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s debt to military men and women does n't end `` the day the uniform comes off,'' President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed legislation Tuesday giving veterans a Cabinet-level voice for the first time. `` I'm saying to all our veterans what I say to new Cabinet members: Welcome aboard!''' said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, the self-proclaimed enemy of an expanding federal government, who once suggested abolishing the departments of Education and Energy. Sitting under a sparkling autumnal sun in front of a columned building of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> War </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> McNair </LOCATION>, the president signed into law the bill creating the Department of Veterans Affairs, effective March 15. Spokesmen for veterans organizations applauded the elevation of veterans issues in the councils of government, but noted that the legislation offers no increases in compensation or improvements in health care. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Holt </PERSON>, executive director of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, said he recalled the day _ last Nov. 10 _ that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signaled he had accepted Cabinet-level status for veterans. `` There were several of us over there at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, and we came prepared to make a case,'' <PERSON> Holt </PERSON> recalled in a telephone interview. `` But when he came in, he apparently had decided against some of his advisers, and he said he wanted to do it.'' Supporters of the legislation had argued that the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> already has the fifth-largest budget among federal agencies and merits being put on par with other Cabinet departments. There are some 27 million veterans and 49 million dependents or survivors, although only about 2.5 to 3 million of them rely on <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> services on a regular basis. The agency has a $ 30 billion budget, and it will disburse $ 14 billion in income maintenance and $ 626 million for education and rehabilitation assistance this year. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the bill gives veterans `` what they have deserved so long _ a seat at the table of our national affairs.'' Flanked by leaders of congressional committees on military affairs, and accompanied by <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> and Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, he said: `` I've said before that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s debt to those who would fight for her defense does n't end the day the uniform comes off. For the security of our nation, it must not end.'' The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, paying election-year homage to veterans, had both given overwhelming approval to the bill. Among other things, it will place a secretary of veterans affairs on the Cabinet, create the position of deputy secretary and as many as a half-dozen assistant secretaries. `` I do n't expect that it is going to produce any miracles,'' said H.F. `` Sparky'' <PERSON> Gierke </PERSON>, national commander of the American Legion. `` It's not going to be an overnight change.'' <PERSON> Gierke </PERSON> said that despite the creation of a larger agency, with another layer of high-ranking assistants, the measure would not consign veterans problems to a mammoth bureaucracy. `` We hope it will run more efficiently,'' he said. `` The vast majority of veterans do not get compensation from the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> and the vast majority of veterans do not use its health care facilities,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Stout </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Vietnam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. `` But we think there are a lot of problems for the people who have to rely on these services ... and we did support the elevation of the agency.'' Ms. <PERSON> Stout </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran, said she hoped any additional clout enjoyed by a secretary of veterans affairs would help those seeking compensation from the government for illnesses they say are connected to the spraying of the chemical defoliant Agent Orange in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. `` It's not so much giving more voice as it is, we hope, giving more accountability'' for the administration of veterans programs, she said. <PERSON> Holt </PERSON> said `` we're delighted. This has really been a priority goal for a long time.'' Spokesmen for the veterans organizations said they hoped to use the new Cabinet seat as a bully pulpit from which they can combat continuing pressure for cuts in veterans benefits as well as other domestic programs.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> admitted Tuesday that its 3-year-old anti-alcoholism campaign has created long lines at liquor stores and led to a moonshining business that has left sugar and candy in short supply. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the official news agency, said the party's policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> adopted a resolution reviewing President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s drive to sober up this nation of 284 million people. None of the Soviet media said when the resolution was approved. According to <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the resolution said the campaign has reduced drinking on the job and in public places, improved family life and cut alcohol-related crime. But it added that `` radical changes have not yet been achieved.'' Sugar and candy shortages developed as moonshiners hoarded sugar to make what they call in Russian `` samogon.'' The anti-alcoholism campaign has caused nationwide disgruntlement and rationing of sugar in many areas. Radio <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> said the `` rush to curtail sales'' of alcohol led to profiteering, poisonings and drug addiction. The Soviet press has been full of reports of these problems but the resolution was one of the frankest official admissions of the program's faults. While saying drunkenness must still be fought vigorously, the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> ordered ministries to `` stamp out alcoholic queues,'' according to <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION>. Lines stretching for blocks are common at liquor stores and other shops where alcohol is sold throughout the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The reports did not say how the long lines would be eliminated but said alcohol sales would not be permitted near schools, factories, recreation areas or on public transport. The Trud labor daily said on Oct. 6 that the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> plans next year to produce more beer, wine, cognac and champagne to meet popular demand. It said vodka and other strong drinks would continue to be manufactured in limited quantities. In May 1985, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> ordered a cut in production of alcoholic beverages, an increase in their price, an increase in the minimum drinking age to 21 and cuts in the hours and number of stores that could sell the products.

 The Energy Department should value its planned sale of a synthetic gas plant in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> as worth $ 200 million instead of the $ 600 million figure it has advertised, according to congressional auditors. Even so, the sale of the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> coal gasification plant near <LOCATION> Beulah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>, will still yield more than the government could expect by operating it over the next 21 years, said analysts from the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. In a report dated Oct. 21 and received Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> analysts said the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> should not count about $ 300 million in tax credits that the prospective buyer, <ORGANIZATION> Basin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION>, has agreed to forgo. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the department had not seen the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report but as a general matter believes it is legitimate to count the value of the tax credits that will not be used. `` That's cash the government would not have had; that's quite legitimate,'' <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> said. Using figures to calculate the loss of future income from the sale of the plant's gas at prices forecast by the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> calculated the sale as yielding the equivalent of $ 203 million to the government. That is midway between the respective $ 284 million and $ 128 million figures that two consultants, <ORGANIZATION> Wharton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Econometrics </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, calculated using their forecasts of future energy prices. The value to the government of the future revenues under government ownership would be $ 166 million using department projections, $ 230 million using Data Resources' estimates and a loss of $ 54 million using <PERSON> Wharton </PERSON>'s estimates, <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. The plant cost $ 2.1 billion to build and was a technical success at turning lignite into pipeline-quality gas. Its builders, though, defaulted on $ 1.5 billion in government guaranteed loans, leaving the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to pay off the loans and take over the plant.

 Wall Street bankers who buy `` cocaine on their lunch break'' should be punished along with drug dealers, smugglers and Colombian narcotics barons, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Tuesday. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> first lady told a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> committee on social affairs the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is responsible for its own drug problem and every American drug user `` is an accomplice to every criminal act, every murder, every terrorist attack carried out by the narcotics syndicates.'' `` To get serious about stopping illegal drugs ... that means confronting all those citizens who use drugs,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, and if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can not conquer the demand for narcotics there is little hope of halting production and smuggling. Her advice to all drug users, from poor children to affluent adults both here and abroad, was `` Just Say ` No','' the slogan of the anti-drug program she sponsors. `` It is often easier to make strong speeches about foreign drug lords or drug smugglers than to arrest a pair of Wall Street investment bankers buying cocaine on their lunch break,'' she said in her address to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Third Committee on Social and Humanitarian Affairs. During his eight years in office, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has advocated a war on drug producers in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and elsewhere, along with interdiction of drugs being smuggled into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. His wife said Tuesday stopping drug use in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is as important as halting the production and smuggling of illegal narcotics. `` While most of the illegal drugs are imported, the drug users are home-grown,'' she said. `` If we lack the will to fully mobilize the forces of law in our own country to arrest and punish drug users, if we can not stem the American demand for drugs, then there will be little hope of preventing foreign drug producers from fulfilling that demand. `` Drugs must remain illegal at every step in the chain.''

<TEXT>
 Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> unveiled a new ad Tuesday accusing Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of deliberately misleading viewers in the last debate, while <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> readied a wave of Populist-flavored spots telling voters he's `` on your side.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also lined up two more network TV interviews in his quest for wider exposure with two weeks left in the campaign. The hard-hitting <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spot focusing on pensions follows <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' assertions in TV ads and on the stump that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is lying about and distorting his record as <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ad was shown at a news conference beamed by satellite to television stations across the country. Campaign aides said they did n't know when or where it might be aired except on news programs that picked up Tuesday's event. It says <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` deliberately misled'' 62 million viewers in the Oct. 13 debate when he denied taking $ 27 million from the state pension fund to balance his state's budget. It shows a debate clip of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> angrily rejecting the charge and quotes the <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> as saying `` it is indisputable'' that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> shifted the money. `` And <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is running a campaign of lies?'' a narrator asks. `` <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is unbelievable.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> each are running a mix of positive and attack ads concentrated in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and other battleground states. The four new <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ads combine a `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is on your side'' motif with the tagline `` Dukakis-Bentsen: The best <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is yet to come.'' Spokeswoman <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> <PERSON> Voles </PERSON> said the ads would start Thursday in various locations around the country. One ad shows children on a playground and says, `` Imagine a place where children come out to play without fear of drugs or drug dealers. Is that too much to expect? As president, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will be on your side. He'll declare a real war on drugs. Double the number of drug agents and slash aid to countries that allow drug traffic.'' Another spot shows a supermarket checkout counter and asks viewers to `` imagine a place where families do n't have to stretch two paychecks for the life one paycheck used to bring. Is that too much to expect? As president, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will be on your side. He's committed to giving earning power back to the American worker.'' The other two focus on the elderly _ `` To those who would cut <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION>, he'll say never. And he'll back full cost-of-living adjustments'' _ and on jobs _ `` He'll forge a partnership of business, labor and government to take on the toughest foreign competition and make <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> number one again.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, lagging in the polls, also is trying keep a high profile through television interviews, and an aide said Tuesday he would be appearing on the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> evening newscasts. Spokesman <PERSON> Dayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would be interviewed live on the CBS Evening News Thursday night, a day after his vice presidential running mate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> appears on the same program. In addition, <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will be interviewed Friday for one in a series of reports <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> is airing next week on the candidates' stands on selected issues. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also will be interviewed for a <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> network show to be broadcast Nov. 6, two days before the election. Since adopting his go-for-broke media strategy, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has appeared on the three network morning programs, a nationally televised cable interview show and Tuesday night on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Nightline. He also bought four five-minute prime-time slots for a paid advertisement that aired Saturday night on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. It was scheduled for repeats on various networks on Tuesday night, on Nov. 1 and on Nov. 5. Each airing costs the campaign between $ 125,000 and $ 175,000. In the five-minute ad, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> accuses <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of running a campaign of `` fear and of smear'' and pledges to fight for Main Street Americans. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had a stormy nine-minute confrontation with <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rather </PERSON> on the CBS news last Jan. 25 early in the primary season. Rather will also interview <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> turned down a `` Nightline'' invitation to appear with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, but is considering interview requests from other news and talk shows. `` We're giving serious consideration to a few of them,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON>. `` We will end up doing several. How many I do n't know. It's a question of whether we can get to them.''

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, who was accused by an aide of sexually assaulting her, was back on the campaign trail for fellow Democrats Tuesday, but is limiting appearances so he does n't hurt their chances, an assistant said `` We are aware there are people out there who want to exploit the situation and we do n't want to play into their hands,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Elmendorf </PERSON>, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' executive assistant.

 Leftist guerrillas dynamited a bus carrying police and election officials in the remote Andes mountains of northwest <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> Tuesday, killing 13 people and wounding 14, officials reported. The casualties brought to 51 the number of people killed in guerrilla attacks since Sunday night. An added blow to the government was the collapse of negotiations aimed at averting a one-day general strike set for Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bolivar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, an umbrella group for all six leftist rebel factions in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, urged President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> to start peace talks with the guerrillas. <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaviria </PERSON>, minister of government, issued a statement Tuesday said the proposal was made in a message sent to the president a day earlier. Guerrillas, who support the strike call, blew up the bus Tuesday morning near <LOCATION> Peque </LOCATION>, a town of 7,000 people about 200 miles northwest of the capital of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. The guerrillas set off dynamite in the road as the bus was going by, the army's 4th Brigade said in a communique from its headquarters in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>. An election for mayor was held last Sunday in <LOCATION> Peque </LOCATION>. The police had been guarding the town against guerrilla attack and the election officials had supervised voting there. Results of the election were not yet known. The military communique said nine policemen and four civilian election officials were killed and 12 policemen and two election officials wounded in the dynamating. Talks broke off Monday between labor unions and government officials. Little hope was seen of avoiding the general strike, <PERSON> Gaviria </PERSON> said in the statement. The unions want pay increases, a price freeze and an end to death squad attacks that have killed 180 union members in the last two years. The unions are the Workers' Unitary Central, the General Confederation of Labor and the Colombian Confederation of Workers. The unions, with about 800,000 members, represent about 10 percent of the work force in this nation of 30 million people. All schools and many businesses and transport companies close during general strikes in fear of violence. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said last week it discovered guerrilla plans to provoke violence during the strike. Guerrillas in a speeding car threw a bomb Tuesday at the offices of a bus company in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, but no one was hurt, a national police communique said.

 A record-breaking year in gifts to <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> bears out a study that found alumnae of women's schools give more to their alma maters than graduates of coeducational schools, fund-raisers said Tuesday Graduates of the elite school gave $ 17.1 million in donations in fiscal 1987. Together with donations from friends, parents, corporations and foundations, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> received $ 28 million for the year. The gifts are a record for a women's college and the envy of other schools. `` I applaud them,'' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, senior writer in development at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s undergraduate college, which last year received $ 27.8 million from its 20,400 pre-1976 graduates. But it was no surprise to another of the prestigious Seven Sisters schools, <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Holyoke </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hadley </LOCATION>, which received $ 18 million from its 24,000 alumnae and other donors in fiscal 1987. <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Holyoke </LOCATION> was rated 11th in the nation last year in the percentage of graduates _ 58.6 _ who give donations. The percentage of alumnae who gave to <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> in fiscal 1987 was not available. `` People have always said: ` Women will not give. They can not give. It's a man's decision where the money goes,''' said <PERSON> Eileen </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON>, director of annual giving at <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Holyoke </LOCATION>. `` But women realize the value of their education and are giving back to provide the same standard of excellence for the future.'' A recent study by the <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, a private, non-profit group representing 70 schools, found that graduates of women's colleges are nearly twice as likely to give to their schools as are men and women graduates of coeducational schools. In 1986-87, almost 40 percent of women who attended single-sex colleges contributed to their alma maters, the study said. It also found that the gifts of alumnae of women's colleges are an average 26 percent larger than those to other colleges. The study looked at fund raising at 51 women's colleges and 354 private coeducational colleges as reported to the Council for Aid to Education, which releases an annual report on voluntary support of education. The fiscal years studied were 1976-77, 1981-82 and 1986-87. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Huchette </PERSON>, associate director of the coalition, said graduates of women's colleges generally earn more than women who attend coeducational institutions, which may account in part for the higher level of giving. Another factor may be effective fund raising by the women's colleges. Women also have more say over the disposition of individual and family wealth than in the past, <PERSON> Huchette </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> strove Tuesday to maintain a hefty lead in the polls, charging that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is appealing to `` division, fear and envy'' in his comeback bid. <PERSON> Said </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, `` We're just working hard and we're going to win.'' The two rivals clashed in commericals and campaign rhetoric as fresh nationwide surveys rated <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the double-digit leader two weeks before Election Day. The vice president said in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was an advocate for economic policies `` far outside the mainstream,'' policies that resemble European socialism more than American free enterprise. And his aides previewed a television commercial accusing the Democratic presidential candidate of deliberately misleading voters about his record as governor. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> renewed his own complaints about Republican ads as he campaigned on the ground in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and on television through commercials and a 90-minute appearance on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Nightline.'' `` Now they've got a tank ad _ has all kinds of misstatements and outright falsehoods,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` We Democrats are for a strong defense.'' Democratic running mate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> added his voice. He said that in their ads, Republicans accuse <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of opposing the Stealth bomber and the Pershing II missile. `` And that's a lie and they know it,'' he said. A survey by <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> gave <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a 54-41 lead among probable voters. The Gallup Organization had the race at 53-39 among likely voters in calls made Friday through Sunday. Both surveys had margins of potential sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. The surveys indicated <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has solidified his advantage in the two weeks since the last presidential debate. But even before the surveys were released, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides were busy trying to cast doubt on the results. These aides, speaking on condition they not be identified, said internal campaign polling showed a six-point lead for the Republican ticket, down from 10 points last week. They said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' recent Populist-style rhetoric and allegations of <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> campaign lies were scoring points. Spokesman <PERSON> Dayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> added, `` Our polling shows by an overwhelming margin people are blaming <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for this negative campaign.'' The campaign air war was relentless. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s aides previewed a commercial saying <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` deliberately misled'' debate viewers when he denied that he'd taken money from the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> pension fund to help balance the state budget. `` And <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is running a campaign of lies?'' a narrator asks. `` <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is unbelievable.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> countered with a series of four commercials showing himself and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and asking viewers to imagine a better <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` As president, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will be on your side,'' says the narrator. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> dispatched surrogates to rebut Democratic charges of unfair campaign tactics. Among them was vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who said desperate Democrats were dishing out `` political sludge'' with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' active encouragement. He branded the entire operation `` despicable'' and said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was a man of `` unshakable integrity and fairness.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sought personally to deflect Democratic charges that he stood for the wealthy at the expense of the less well off. `` We will move forward not by succumbing to the base temptations of division, fear and envy, but by following, as <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> said, those better angels of our nature,'' he told a breakfast in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had been making `` increasing appeals to class conflict,'' and said that in his view there was `` no place in <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> life for philosophies that divide Americans one from another along class lines and that excite conflict among them.'' The vice president charged his <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> rival was `` far outside the mainstream of economic thinking and he's broken with the American tradition of entrepreneurship and free enterprise.'' The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> favors an industrial policy of control that has been tried and rejected as unsuccessful in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` Around the world, governments are abandoning socialism, moving away from socialistic, high control experience ... and embracing the American model of low taxation, entrepreneurship and individual intitative.'' <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief of staff, asked if the vice president was calling <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> a socialist, said, `` That would be going too far.'' Campaign surrogates were making their customary rounds. Senate GOP Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, predicting a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> victory and taunting <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> that he deserved a `` Rip Van Winkle'' award. `` He just sort of went to sleep there for about six or eight weeks and when he woke up the election was over,'' said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, who lost out to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the springtime race for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nomination. Democratic Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> agreed that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> made a mistake by failing to respond to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s attacks for weeks at a time. He disagreed with <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> that the race was over, praised the Democrat's latest round of television commercials and said, `` I would have done it eight weeks ago.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> began airing a series of television commercials last weekend that charged the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign with distortions and lies. His campaign also purchased time for a five-minute paid advertisement on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> late Tuesday night that duplicated a commercial aired Saturday night on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. In it, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of running a campaign of `` fear and of smear'' and pledged to fight for Main Street Americans.

 <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s Soviet-backed government claimed that 69 American and `` Arabian'' advisers were killed Tuesday as they helped Islamic guerrillas in the eastern part of the country. A half-hour later, it lowered the number to six. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> called the reports `` unbelievable'' and `` ridiculous.'' The official Afghan radio also announced that <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> authorities decided to release two West German medical personnel _ Dr. <PERSON> Benno </PERSON> <PERSON> Spliet </PERSON> and nurse <PERSON> Lea </PERSON> <PERSON> Hochstalt </PERSON> _ captured on Sept. 8 after treating civilian war wounded. The radio said in its main 7:30 p.m. newscast that government security forces inflicted heavy losses on `` criminals,'' its term for <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> fighters, in <LOCATION> Paktia </LOCATION> province which borders <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. It said it received a report Tuesday that 43 `` criminals'' were killed and 24 wounded. `` The report adds that 69 American and <PERSON> Arabian </PERSON> advisers who had a direct hand in the criminals' activities and are helping the criminals also were killed today,'' according to the broadcast. In the next broadcast a half-hour later, it revised the number to six without explanation. It did not specify the nationality of the Arabs. <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s official news media began claiming the death and capture of Americans in Afghan territory on Oct. 16 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which backs the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION>, denies it has any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` No, I would n't believe the reports at all,'' said an embassy spokesman, speaking on condition his name not be used. `` It's unbelievable It's a ridiculous allegation.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and other Western diplomats said earlier Tuesday that the communists' claims of killing and capturing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> advisers was false propaganda aimed at inflating the communists' image. <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s official news agency, <ORGANIZATION> Bakhtar </ORGANIZATION>, and national television reported three `` American advisers'' were killed and four captured inside the country between Oct. 16-22. The Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> ran the stories later. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassies in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> challenged the Afghans for proof. `` Since there are no <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> advisers whatsoever in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, all of these stories are fabrications,'' the embassy in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> stated Tuesday. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arming and training of <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas on Pakistani soil is well documented but <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> refuses to discuss details. It has always denied the presence of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> itself. Western diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the series of Afghan reports appeared to be propaganda from a government whose security is treatened by increasing rebel pressure. About half of more than 100,000 Soviet troops withdrew from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> between May 15 and Aug. 15 under a U.N.-sponsored accord signed last April. The rest are to be out by next Feb. 15. <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> claimed the capture of five of about 30 provincial capitals since May and the siege of others. <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> suffers rocket attacks almost daily. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, head of state and leader of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Afghanistan </ORGANIZATION>, has issued repeated appeals for peace talks and national reconciliation.

 <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, the 6-year-old whose death last year elicited an outpouring of grief and rage, was a murder victim, brutally battered by the only father she ever knew, a prosecutor charged Tuesday. <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> `` beat <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> so severely that he inflicted those injures which caused her death,'' said Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Casolaro </PERSON> in a 30-minute statement at the start of <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s murder trial `` We expect to show by the evidence that he killed that child,'' <PERSON> Casolaro </PERSON> told the panel `` graphic and grotesque'' evidence and testimony will prove <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> murdered <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>, who was found unconscious in the <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> apartment early Nov. 2, 1987, and died of her injuries three days later. The prosecutor told the jury the first-grader had bruises on her chest, legs, arms and neck, along with head injuries caused by `` blunt-force trauma,'' when she arrived at the hospital that morning. Police officers there noticed <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s wounded, bleeding knuckles, he said. As <PERSON> Casolaro </PERSON> detailed the child's injuries, <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'s biological mother, <PERSON> Michele </PERSON> <PERSON> Launders </PERSON>, sat crying in the front row of the courtroom. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, 47, once a respected millionaire defense lawyer, is charged with second-degree murder in the death of the child he adopted illegally at birth from Ms. Launders, then an unmarried teen-ager. He has denied ever hitting <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s attorney, <LOCATION> Ira </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, urging the jury to concentrate on the facts and not his client's morality, maintained in his 10-minute argument that the evidence in the much-anticipated trial will not support a murder charge. He called on the jury to acquit <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> based on the evidence and launched an attack on <PERSON> Hedda </PERSON> <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s longtime live-in companion, who was called `` the single most important witness in this case'' by trial judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothwax </PERSON>. `` It will not be proven in this case that <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> was murdered, nor will it be proven that <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> was a battered child,'' <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> told the jury. `` <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> was neither sullen or withdrawn. She was a vital, active and engaging child until her death.'' In an effort to undercut Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>'s expected testimony, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> called her `` delusional,'' mentioned she had spent the last year in a psychiatric hospital and alluded to her `` self-destructive romance with Satanic cults'' and sado-masochistic behavior. <PERSON> Casolaro </PERSON> painted Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> as a victim of <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> as well: `` He exploited her weakness of mind and her emotional problems. The defendant beat and broke Miss <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> until she had become nothing more than his willing servant.'' Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, 46, has a cooperation agreement with the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> district attorney's office to testify, although she has told prosecutors she did not see <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> strike <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> the day she fell unconscious. She was charged along with <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> in <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'s death, but was never indicted and the charges will probably be dropped, the district attorney's office said. After her arrest, she underwent surgery and psychiatric treatment for injuries allegedly inflicted by <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>. The trial is expected to last four to eight weeks. Following opening arguments, Police Officer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Botte </PERSON> _ the first person to arrive at the <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> apartment and see the unconscious girl _ testified the home was dirty, unkempt and dark when he arrived. His testimony was corroborated by the next witness, paramedic <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Filangeri </PERSON>, who added that when he asked <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> to bring a lamp into the room, the defendant replied, `` Is that really important?'' <PERSON> Filangeri </PERSON> also testified that Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> answered the front door when he arrived at the apartment, and described her battered condition. `` She appeared to be 70 to 80 years of age. She had numerous facial injuries, some old, some new,'' <PERSON> Filangeri </PERSON> recalled. `` She had gray hair and was stooped.'' <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'s 16-month-old brother, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, was found in the apartment sitting in a dirty diaper and tethered to a playpen, authorities have said. The boy was also illegally adopted, and now lives with his birth mother. In <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s version of what happened the night of Nov. 1, 1987, <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> became sick after eating and the bruises on her back and chest resulted from his efforts to revive her after she fell unconscious in their home. No help was called for <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> until after 6:30 a.m. on Nov. 2, court records show. <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> was pronounced brain dead on Nov. 5. The slaying of the girl drew national attention and produced a city-wide outpouring of grief for the girl and rage against <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>. The doorway of her <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> home was turned into a virtual shrine, filled with flowers, gifts and poems from people who never knew <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>. Her wake and funeral drew tremendous crowds of strangers, many of them with tears in their eyes. Groups which support battered children seized on <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> as a martyr whose death symbolized the plight of abused children across the country.

<TEXT>
 The chief witness against <PERSON> Bess </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> admitted Tuesday that there were numerous differences between her previous sworn statements and what she has told the jury at the former <LOCATION> Miss </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s divorce-fixing trial. Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>'s attorney got <PERSON> Sukhreet </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> to concede that 10 things she told the jury last week about a conversation she had with <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> in 1986 were not in a detailed memo she wrote shortly after the meeting. Ms. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> is the daughter of former state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Hortense </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>, 75, who is on trial with <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>, 64, and <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>'s boyfriend, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> `` Andy'' <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>, 43. They are charged with conspiracy, mail fraud and bribe-related charges. In later testimony, Ms. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> said her mother once described <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> as `` a delightful cuckoo.'' Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>, once the city's cultural affairs commissioner, is accused of giving Ms. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>, 39, a $ 19,000-a-year city job to influence her mother's decisions in <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>'s divorce. Under questioning by the prosecution last week, Ms. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> testified that while a grand jury was investigating the circumstances of how she got her job, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> appeared at her apartment, invited her for a walk and told her: `` Keep your mouth shut.'' Prosecutors charge that <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> obstructed justice in allegedly trying to keep Ms. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> from testifying truthfully to the grand jury. But <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hafetz </PERSON> underscored numerous inconsistencies in Ms. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>'s most damaging testimony against <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>. In a sworn statement she gave last year, Ms. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>, who left the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> in 1984, said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>'s appearance at her apartment on June 18, 1986, was `` out of the blue'' and added: `` I did n't want to have anything to do with her. But <PERSON> Hafetz </PERSON> noted that a week before the night Ms. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> said she talked with her old boss, she had written Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> seeking a recommendation to law school. When <PERSON> Hafetz </PERSON> asked if that was a change from her testimony that she did n't want to have anything to do with <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>, the witness said, `` No,'' and then blurted out, `` I would characterize it as politics makes strange bedfellows.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> warned Ms. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> against volunteering information under oath. `` Stop volunteering answers,'' he lectured. `` If you do it one more time, I'm going to get a little angry. Now stop it!'' <PERSON> Hafetz </PERSON> also got Ms. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> to admit that she wrote a detailed memo to her lawyer shortly after the alleged walk and talk with <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> but 10 of the statements she attributed to <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> in her trial testimony such as: `` You can make a lot of trouble;'' `` We've got to get our stories straight,'' and `` You've got to keep your mouth shut'' were not included in the memo. At the time she submitted the memo, Ms. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> conceded, she told her lawyer that she had not `` left out anything substantive.'' And Ms. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> admitted that in an interview with defense lawyers before the trial she said, `` There was no attempt by <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> to subvert governmental processes'' and agreed that <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> did not ask her to change her memory.

 A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> band played `` God Bless <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' and sailors from the frigate USS <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> marched in review Tuesday as Grenadians celebrated the fifth anniversary of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion that ousted a Marxist junta. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials joined a crowd of about 1,500 for a military parade in the Queen's Park sports stadium to mark the invasion. Oct. 25 is now known as Thanksgiving Day on the island and is a national holiday. The American marchers were joined by <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION>'s police force and coast guard. A police unit marched in a formation that made the number 5, for the anniversary. A message from Presdident <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> read by <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> had made major progress since 1983, paid tribute to the 19 American servicemen killed in the invasion of the nation twice the size of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, and declared: `` The <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> that we know today, a free, peaceful country, is the best confirmation that those lives were not lost in vain.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, joined by seven Eastern Caribbean nations that provided token forces, sent 6,000 Marines and paratroopers to <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> to expel a Marxist military junta that had seized power in a coup. Six days earlier, soldiers had executed Prime Minister <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> and 10 other officials of his leftist government, killed scores of bystanders with mortars and automatic weapons and placed the country under 24-hour curfew. <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> was overthrown as a result of factional feuding within his government. It was the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military intervention in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> in two decades and was widely criticized abroad as a violation of <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION>'s sovereignty. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration said the invasion was mounted at the request of the Organization of Eastern <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which feared <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> would use <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> as a staging area communist aggression in the region. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> denied any aggressive aims in <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION>'s 94,100 residents generally regard the invasion, which the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration called a `` rescue mission,'' as a liberation from repression and near-anarchy. In a speech Tuesday, Prime Minister <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Blaize </PERSON> chided Grenadians `` who were on their knees in 1983'' but had forgotten `` the deliverance that God had worked for them.'' `` It was God who sent the Americans and <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> forces to deliver them,'' <PERSON> Blaize </PERSON> said. Prime Minister <PERSON> Eugenia </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Dominica </LOCATION>, one of the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> leaders supporting the invasion, said it was undertaken to restore democracy and order and to safeguard <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens on the island, but above all was necessary `` to save our own skins.'' A memorial service was held at the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Anse </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, where 480 <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> students were evacuated by helicopter. A bronze monument on the campus bears the names of the 19 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen who died in the operation. Forty-four Grenadians and 24 Cubans also were killed. Since the invasion, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has poured $ 110 million into <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> to finish an international airport started by <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, pave hundreds of miles of potholed roads and improve electricity, telephone and water systems. Parliamentary democracy is well-established and tourism has improved, but not to the extent expected just after the invasion. A hoped-for flood of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investment has not materialized and the island's economy, based on agriculture, continues to struggle. Other Americans at the ceremony included Vice Adm. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Metcalf </PERSON>, commander of the invasion; Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Milligan </PERSON>, chief of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> armed forces in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Melton </PERSON>, deputy assistant secretary of state for the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooper </ORGANIZATION>, charge d'affaires at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 Federal investigators on Tuesday blamed a quick turn during takeoff for the crash of an AVAir commuter plane last February at <LOCATION> Raleigh-Durham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, airport. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said the pilot of the aircraft maneuvered too sharply at low altitude, resulting in the loss of control and crash that killed 12 people on board. The AVAir commuter plane, flying as <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eagle </ORGANIZATION> Flight 378, crashed shortly after it departed the airport in dense fog on Feb. 19, l988, landing in a wooded area about a mile from the runway. The Fairchild Metro III commuter was bound for <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, with 10 passengers, a pilot and a co-pilot. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said the probable cause for the accident was `` the failure of the flight crew to maintain a proper flight path due to the first officer's inappropriate instrument scan, the captain's inadequate monitoring of the flight and the flight crew's response to a fault in the airplane's stall avoidance system.'' The investigation revealed that the co-pilot, <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Digan </PERSON>, 28, who had been hired by AVAir in May 1987, had a spotty training record and on a number of occasions had been the subject of poor evaluations by various AVAir captains. In September 1987, another AVAir captain reported in an evaluation that Ms. <PERSON> Digan </PERSON> had problems in climb, cruise, descent and landing maneuvers. Two months before that, another captain wrote AVAir's operations director on hotel stationery that he considered Ms. <PERSON> Digan </PERSON>'s performance in landing his airplane `` unacceptable'' and that on their trip she had trouble with eight of 10 landings. The <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> criticized AVAir, which no longer operates commuter flights, for not acting sooner to deal with Ms. <PERSON> Digan </PERSON>'s flying problems. It also said the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s failure to monitor adequately AVAir's financial and operational problems was a contributing factor to the Feb. 19 accident. AVAir, which since l985 had a marketing agreement with <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, underwent rapid growth in l987 after <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> expanded its hub operation at <LOCATION> Raleigh-Durham </LOCATION>. It hired 123 pilots in the second quarter of l987 alone and by l988, about 60 percent of its pilots had less than a year with the company. But AVAir began having financial problems in late l987, filed for protection under the bankruptcy laws on Jan. 15, l988 and ceased operation, only to resume flights on Feb. 3, about two weeks before the crash. Last May, AVAir sold its commuter operations to <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> which continues to fly those operations under the name <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eagle </ORGANIZATION>. Investigators determined that Ms. <PERSON> Digan </PERSON> was at the controls when the <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> III </ORGANIZATION> commuter plane departed <LOCATION> Raleigh-Durham </LOCATION> on Feb. 19, although there was evidence that the captain, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, 38, attempted to help keep the aircraft aloft in the final seconds. Flight 378 had been told by air traffic control to bank to the right as soon as possible after takeoff because of the heavy traffic loads at the time of the departure, investigators said. But Ms. <PERSON> Digan </PERSON>, the investigation concluded, banked the aircraft too sharply and at too low an altitude _ about a 40 degree bank only 200 feet off the ground, or nearly twice as sharp as would have been advised. The plane was relying on instruments because of the heavy fog and the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> concluded that if the pilots had scanned their instruments adequately they would have known their bank was too sharp and at too low an altitude. The <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> report said the pilots also might have been distracted by a light indicating that the aircraft's stall warning system had activated. The system automatically forces the nose down if the aircraft is approaching a stall situation. But, according to the investigation, the aircraft's performance indicated that the stall warning system actually had not deployed, but that the problem stemmed from a false warning light.

<TEXT>
 Government leaders will meet in emergency session this week on <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s economic crisis, <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency announced Tuesday. It said the Cabinet and nine-member collective Presidency will meet in joint session Friday. Only two such meetings have been held since the Communists came to power after World War II _ in April 1981 and November 1985. `` The mere fact that the Presidency has decided to convene the joint session indicates the gravity of the situation facing our country's economy,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said. Premier <PERSON> Branko </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikulic </PERSON> said in a recent interview that the government will introduce `` a completely new market-oriented economic system.'' The plan, which could be adopted by Parliament by the end of the year, envisages closing down all money-losing firms, the wide introduction of both <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> and foreign capital investments and the sales of stocks and bonds. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> is beset by ethnic and social unrest as well as its worst economic crisis since World War II. The nation's inflation rate is running at more than 217 percent, the highest in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> has a $ 21 billion foreign debt and a 15 percent unemployment rate. Labor dissatisfaction has grown worse since May, when government austerity measures chopped wagwes and allowed substantial price increases. About half of the nation's companies, employing about 2 million workers, are losing money and layoffs could trigger more social restivity. Other developments Tuesday came in the ethnic conflict involving Montenegrins, Slavs and ethnic Albanians. The Parliament of the southern republic of <LOCATION> Montenegro </LOCATION> gave a confidence vote to all but five members of the 20-member <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> following a debate over police actions during a demonstration, according to <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Belgrade </ORGANIZATION>. Well informed sources said <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders from <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, an autonomous province in the Serbian republic, would meet Friday in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> amid demands by <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s Serbs that the entire provincial leadership be replaced. Ethnic Albanians form a majority in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> and Serbs and Montenegrins accuse them of harassment. More than 30,000 Slavs and Montenegrins have left <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> since 1981, when at least nine people were killed in ethnic violence. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> has six republics with two autonomous provinces, <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION>, that are part of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON> <PERSON> Morina </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s minister of interior, told the provincial <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday that `` the security situation in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> is very grave, with worsening tendencies,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> reported. It said he blamed both Albanian and Serbian nationalists for ethnic tensions. Radio Belgrade said the <ORGANIZATION> Montenegrin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> gave a vote of confidence to the presidency and 15 of the 20 members of the government after a 12-hour debate on charges the government overstepped its authority by ordering police to break up a demonstration in <LOCATION> Titograd </LOCATION>, the capital of the republic. It said <PERSON> Lazar </PERSON> <PERSON> Djodic </PERSON>, the republic's interior secretary, was among the five not given a vote of confidence, but did not say if that meant he and the others would have to resign. Ten people were injured and 12 were arrested during rioting in <LOCATION> Titograd </LOCATION> on Oct. 7 when demonstrators demanded the firing of local and federal leaders who they blamed for economic and social problems.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told a persistent young reporter from a children's news program he would rather she had a baby than abort the fetus if she became pregnant through her father. `` That's a difficult question and one that does not have an easy answer, but my answer would be yes,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate told an 11-year-old reporter for `` Children's Express'' during a bus tour of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> last week The question-and-answer session was broadcast Tuesday on the CBS evening news. The children's show is broadcast on public television. `` But do n't you think it would ruin my whole life? ... It's not even my fault and my whole life would be ruined,'' the reporter asked. `` Well, I do n't think that would be the case at all,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` I think that if somebody had an unfortunate experience like that, it would be something that you would remember the rest of your life. `` The idea of a father abusing a daughter is a horrendous situation, one you wish that would never occur, but unfortunatley it does occur. ... It's a tragic situation.'' `` So you would want me to have the baby even though my whole life would be ruined and I could be mentally affected?'' she asked later. `` I would hope that the baby would live ...,'' he said. `` I would just like to see the baby have an opportunity.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was answering abortion questions again on Tuesday in his plane to <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator was asked about a comment the previous day in which he said that he hoped if his wife were raped and became pregnant, he hoped she would elect to have the baby and not have the abortion. Asked if that was n't a pro-choice stance, he said: `` It's her choice, I told her what I would like but it's her choice. I cant tell my wife what to do in that situation.'' `` She would have that choice'' under the law as it is now written, he said.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Australian novelist <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> was awarded the coveted Booker Prize for fiction Tuesday night for his love story, `` Oscar and <PERSON> Lucinda </PERSON>.'' A panel of five judges unanimously announced the award of the $ 26,250 prize after an 80-minute deliberation during a banquet at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s ancient Guildhall. The judges made their selection from 102 books published in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in the past 12 months and which they read in their homes. <PERSON> Carey </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION> with his wife and son, said in a brief speech that like the other five finalists he had been asked to attend with a short speech in his pocket in case he won. `` If I'd known I was going to win I think I would have taken a bit more trouble with my handwriting,'' he said as he stared down at his notes. He was unsuccessful in the prize competition in 1985 when his novel, `` Illywhacker,'' was among the final six. <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> called the award a `` great honor'' and he thanked the prize sponsors for `` provoking so much passionate discussion about literature _ perhaps there will be more tomorrow.'' `` Everyone who loves good books benefits from this, surely,'' he added. The winning novel is a fitting choice for <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s bicentennial year It tells of a romance between an English gambler and an Australian heiress who meet on a steamship's maiden voyage to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> in the mid-19th century. The story weaves in Australian history from its founding in 1788 by <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> immigrants. Panel chairman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Foot </PERSON>, a writer and former leader of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said the judges agreed that entries this year had been `` exceptionally strong'' and that choosing the last six novels was extremely difficult. `` We hope there will be no criticisms but if there are, then people should start reading the books for themselves,'' Foot said. <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> was the only non-Briton in the final six. The son of an auto dealer, he was born in <LOCATION> Bacchus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marsh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION>, and attended <ORGANIZATION> Geelong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grammar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Melbourne </LOCATION>, where the Prince of <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> was also a pupil as an 18-year-old in 1966. <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> was an advertising copywriter before turning to writing books in 1965. The first Booker Prize was awarded in 1969. It is administered by Book Trust, an educational charity promoting books, and is sponsored by <PERSON> Booker </PERSON>, an international food and farming business.

 <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, visiting the farm community where his grandfather first settled in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, renewed his counterattack Tuesday against what he called Republican `` lies and distortions'' about Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` They say Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> opposes the Stealth bomber. And I'm here to tell you that's a lie, and they know it,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said `` They say Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> opposed deployment of the Pershing II missile. And that's a lie, and they know it,'' he said. The Democrats and Republicans plan to spend the same amount on defense _ but the <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> would `` spend those dollars smarter,'' he said, for `` planes that fly, guns that work, ammunition and spare parts.'' `` I think the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people want better than lies and distortions in this campaign,'' he said, challenging <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to drop his ads attacking <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' defense positions. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator, who usually campaigns in states with the most electoral votes, was in a state with the fewest _ three. He spoke in a school auditorium to a crowd that was about double the White, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, population of 474, and was greeted like a team at a homecoming, with a band, pompon girls and loud cheering. Shops around town had greetings in the windows, and one street was renamed <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> <PERSON> Blvd </PERSON>. for the day. The senator dropped by the Palace Cafe and Hotel to visit with some elderly women from the town who went to school with <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s 94-year-old father, <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sr </ORGANIZATION> They told of still receiving gifts of fruit from the elder <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, who now lives near <LOCATION> McAllen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Getting his father on the phone after a while, the senator assured him `` they even told some good things about you.'' The phone got handed around the table and they talked of the one-teacher school where <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON> made it through the fifth grade. The luncheonette's special of the day: The <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> <PERSON> Burger </PERSON>, which at three bucks included potatoes, vegetable, dessert and coffee. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> helped dedicate the historical museum for the town, which was surrounded by sheep, cattle and the fields where <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said his grandfather <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> first homesteaded after arriving from <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> in 1887. The family survived the first winter in a sod hut by burning straw for heat. Back on the subject of the election, he said the Republicans' campaign `` robs the heart of democracy It deprives you of the opportunity to judge the issues and the candidates.'' As the Democrats `` spent critical weeks'' developing solutions to problems such as health care, education, and housing, `` all the while our opponents campaigned with a total disregard for the truth,'' he said. It was the first time <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> has offered a reason why the Democrats failed to quickly counter the Republican attacks. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> delivered the same message later in the day, after arriving at a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>, rally on a stagecoach. Wearing blue jeans, a leather jacket and a Western hat, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and a local farmer named <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Haugland </PERSON> drove a team of four Clydesdales into a livestock show area while more than 700 supporters hollered their approval. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s visit Tuesday to the Dakotas and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> was the second trip to the region by the Democratic ticket since he and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> stopped in <LOCATION> Minot </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>, immediately after the Democratic convention in July. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had a rally in Fargo earlier this month. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told reporters on his campaign jet that while there were only 10 electoral votes between the three states, `` it might make the difference.'' `` Nobody has paid any attention to these states,'' he said. Sen. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Daschle </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinner </PERSON>, and Sen. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON>, D-Mont., joined <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> on stage at the school, which had an enormous American flag as a backdrop

 Israeli troops opened fire Tuesday on stone-throwing Palestinian demonstrators in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, killing a 14-year-old girl, hospital officials said. The driver of an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> oil tanker fired into a crowded <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> vegetable market and wounded three Palestinians after his vehicle was hit by a firebomb, according to Arab witnesses. They said the bomb hit a tire and did not cause serious damage. Another 16 Palestinians were wounded in clashes between troops and demonstrators in seven towns and refugee camps in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, Arab hospital officials said. The army confirmed three wounded in the occupied lands and said it was checking the other casualty reports. The dead girl was identified as <PERSON> Manal </PERSON> <PERSON> Samour </PERSON> of the Shati refugee camp on the edge of <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. She was dead on arrival at the city's <LOCATION> Ahli </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> with a single bullet wound in the chest, said the hospital officials, who insisted on anonymity Doctors said the family removed the body for immediate burial. Witnesses in Shati said the girl apparently was struck when soldiers fired on demonstrators from a rooftop. The witnesses, speaking on condition of anonymity, said anti-Israeli protests erupted in the camp after news of the girl's death spread. The camp later was put under curfew, witnesses said. An army spokesman said he was checking the report of the girl's death and the curfew The death raised to 303 the number of Palestinians killed since the start of the uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> rule in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> on Dec. 8. Six Israelis also have died. Also Tuesday, an army spokesman confirmed that soldiers fatally shot a 17-year-old Palestinian during a clash Monday in the Faraa refugee camp near <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. The spokesman said troops fired rubber bullets after being attacked by youths throwing bottles and rocks. `` The soldiers found their lives endangered, and an officer fired one bullet which hit one of the youths. He died later,'' the spokesman said. In the incident involving the tanker driver, three Palestinians were wounded, including a 50-year-old Palestinian hit in the chest, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> witnesses said. They said soldiers rushed to the scene, but fired only in the air to disperse the crowd. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, two people were injured slightly when the buses in which they were riding were struck with stones, police said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Itim </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported authorities shut down the <LOCATION> Rashidiyeh </LOCATION> high school in Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> until Oct. 31 because of a demonstration Tuesday by students protesting the suspensions of 58 classmates. It said the the 58 were suspended because they repeatedly skipped classes.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> decolonization committee on Tuesday called on <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> and the Polisario independence movement to start direct peace talks to settle their war for sovereignty over the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION>. The committee, officially known as the <ORGANIZATION> Fourth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, voted 87-0 with 53 abstentions in favor of the motion sponsored by <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, an ally of the Marxist-led Polisario movement. Polisario has been fighting for independence for the former Spanish colony since 1975, when the colonial administration left and Moroccan troops and settlers took over the sparsely populated, 110,000-square-mile territory in northwest <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> opposes direct talks with <PERSON> Polisario </PERSON>, saying that negotiating with the movement as an equal before the Saharans have chosen them as their representative would grant <PERSON> Poliario </PERSON> a status they have not earned. Most of the sponsors of Tuesday's motion were socialist and developing nations. <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> voted in favor of the motion; the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and most other Western nations abstained. <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> did not vote. The motion calls on <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Polisario </LOCATION> to begin direct negotiations for a cease-fire and for holding a referendum on seld-determination for the <LOCATION> Saharan </LOCATION> people. It also welcomed the acceptance by both sides in principle of Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>'s proposal that they honor a truce and hold the referendum. Polisario spokesmen say that so far in indirect talks through the secretary-general, the two parties have only agreed on the wording of the referendum, which will be for either independence or affiliation with <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, and that only people counted as Saharans in the last colonial census in 1974 will be eligible to vote. That census put the population at 76,000. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> plans to send about 2,000 peacekeeping troops to <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> to monitor the referendum and see that Moroccan troops and Polisario fighters remain in their barracks and camps. Polisario says it has about 7,000 fighters in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION>, and that <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> has 185,000 soldiers there. The independence movement says that all except 7,000 Moroccan troops should withdraw to their homeland before the referendum is conducted.

The 10, all from <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, were among a group ranging in number from 15 to 25 who entered the offices at noon.

 An <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> helicopter on a nighttime anti-drug smuggling mission clipped a power line and smashed into a desert hillside, killing the five lawmen and three guardsmen aboard, officials said Tuesday. The fiery crash Monday came on the first night of Operation Border Ranger, a joint anti-drug smuggling program conducted by six <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> sheriff's departments and the federal government, said <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Maj. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Mensik </PERSON>. The program to stem the flow of drugs into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has been suspended while the accident investigation is carried out, he said. The UH-1H aircraft crashed while investigating a car parked on a remote access road off Interstate 8 in the <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grade </LOCATION> area, about 70 miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mensik </PERSON> said. `` They were in the process of descending to get a closer look at the suspect vehicle. Apparently, at about 500 feet, they struck a power line that had been strung between two hilltops,'' he said. Lt. Col. <PERSON> Gage </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, who declined to give his first name, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that the car observed by the helicopter apparently was a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Border Patrol vehicle. When asked what happened to the car, he said: `` Nothing. I believe it turned out to be a Border Patrol vehicle. That's the best estimate.'' <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Musegades </PERSON>, the chief patrol agent for the <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> sector, said a <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> vehicle that was not involved in Operation Border Ranger was `` a few hundred yards from the crash scene.'' It is common practice for <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> agents to dim their lights and park while on patrol, he added. He could n't confirm that the helicopter had dropped down to check out the vehicle, <PERSON> Musegades </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Imperial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's Lt. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koon </PERSON> said the helicopter smashed into the rocky foothills of the <LOCATION> Laguna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> at 9:30 p.m. Monday and burst into flame. `` It was a very volatile fire. It burned everything. There was very little left of the aircraft and it's going to be difficult to put it -LRB- the accident -RRB- together,'' <PERSON> Koon </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, chief <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said the crash was observed by a spotter helicopter, an OH-58, that was flying at a higher altitude. Five deputies from four <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> counties and a three-man <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> crew were aboard the helicopter.

Questioned about the status of the program, he replied, `` That's a decision that will have to made by the sheriffs who put it together, but I think it's a job that's going to have to be done, one way or another.

<HEAD>Assembly Again Supports Nicaragua, World Court Against U.S. Contra
Aid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As it has done for three consecutive years, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday voted to support a <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to Nicaraguan rebels and urged <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to obey the court. The vote was 89-2, with 48 abstentions on the resolution calling on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to comply with the 1986 World Court ruling against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> funding of anti-government insurgents. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> voted against the resolution, as they have in the past in the 159-nation <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. Other nations were absent. Last year the vote was 94-2, with 48 abstentions. The <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> supported <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> Tuesday, changing its vote from last year's abstention. Other nations which voted for <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> last year were absent or abstaining this year and observers said it was not a clear-cut gain for either side. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Okun </PERSON>, the deputy permanent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> representative, told the assembly that repeated consideration of the item `` makes no contribution to peace in Central America'' and said the item should be stricken from the agenda. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vote against this resolution is not a vote against the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Okun </PERSON> said. `` It is a vote against a worn-out issue that is translated by the government of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> into support for a repressive Sandinista government.'' <PERSON> Okun </PERSON> called the resolution `` counterproductive'' and said <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government has increased its repression of democracy during the past year. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> argues that the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s formal name, lacks jurisdiction in the case because all parties to a dispute must accept jurisdiction and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has rejected it. The World Court statute does not require any state to accept jurisdiction and the court operates on the basis of concensus and acceptance of its authority. In 1986 the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled that continued <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> financing of Nicaraguan rebels, known as Contras, constituted interference in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s internal affairs. The World Court is the primary <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> legal body and each <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> member agrees to abide by its rulings. The resolution, identical to that submitted last year, says that all states are obliged under international law not to intervene in the internal affairs of other states. The Nicaraguan resolution urgently calls for full and immediate compliance by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with the court ruling and says that the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> will consider the issue again next year.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A one-time whiz kid of carpet cleaning took the witness stand in his securities fraud trial Tuesday and admitted he manipulated stocks and defrauded investors in a multimillion-dollar swindle. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON>, 22, assuming an embarrassed, shy demeanor, also began laying out for jurors a defense of duress in which he claims that organized crime figures dictated his every move. <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> told jurors he was threatened with broken limbs or death if he did n't run his business according to the dictates of two men _ one who he said tried to sexually molest him and the other `` a Nazi'' who defamed <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON>'s Jewish heritage. `` I felt like I was taking money from the devil,'' he said of his alliance with the second man. <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> described how he came under the sway of the first man, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Krowpman </PERSON>, a 230-pound weight lifter, tool salesman and reputed loan shark who befriended <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> at a gym where he exercised in his early teens. `` He was my idol,'' said <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON>. `` He was everything because he had money; he had build. He had everything I did n't have. ... He was nice to me. He was like the father I never had. I loved him.'' But he indicated <PERSON> Krowpman </PERSON> had a cruel side that surfaced when he would arrive at the gym with a 6-foot-9, 330-pound weight lifter he introduced as `` Big Steve.'' `` When him and <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> were together it was like night and day,'' said <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON>. `` They would tease me about being puny and not able to lift weights. They would throw me in the pool with my clothes on. It was n't the same.'' Later, he said, <PERSON> Krowpman </PERSON> gave him $ 1,600 to set up his carpet cleaning business but began demanding payments of $ 200 a month plus 50 per cent of the profits. He also blurted out that <PERSON> Krowpman </PERSON> once tried to molest him and said he began paying him `` after the attempted rape.'' <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON>'s lawyer has said <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON>, who launched his <ORGANIZATION> ZZZZ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Best </ORGANIZATION> carpet cleaning company at 16 in his parents garage, was beaten and threatened by mobsters who used him to perpetuate a $ 25 million stock fraud. But prosecutors have portrayed <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> as a shrewd con man who bilked investors for his own benefit, selling them on the future of a business that for the most part did not exist. <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> is charged with 57 counts of securities fraud, credit card fraud and mail fraud. Ten of his 12 co-defendants, including <PERSON> Krowpman </PERSON>, have pleaded guilty to various charges related to the ZZZZ Best operation. Accountant <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothberg </PERSON> is on trial with <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON>, accused of taking a bribe to cover up ZZZZ Best's frauds. The husky, dark-haired <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> appeared nervous in his initial moments on the stand. As his lawyer, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenner </PERSON>, asked him to admit he had done the acts charged in the indictment, there were long pauses and he bowed his head as if ashamed before he answered. Asked if he had made false claims for his business, <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> replied softly: `` It's true. I made those claims and they were all lies.'' The case is being heard by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Dickran </PERSON> <PERSON> Tavrizian </PERSON>.

 Forty-nine civil rights activists who were pelted with rocks and bottles when they marched into virtually all-white <LOCATION> Forsyth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> were awarded nearly $ 1 million by a jury that found the <PERSON> Ku </PERSON> <PERSON> Klux </PERSON> Klan responsible. A verdict unsealed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday also found 11 individuals responsible for attacking the activists, who marched into the county north of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> on Jan. 17, 1987, and were met by the counter-demonstrators, many of them <ORGANIZATION> KKK </ORGANIZATION> members or sympathizers. The jury reached its verdict Oct. 5, but Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moye </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> ordered it sealed to give those who brought the lawsuit time to decide whether to join <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> City Councilman <PERSON> Hosea </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who wanted to drop it. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who helped organize the march and was among those who filed the lawsuit, urged toward the end of the trial that it be dropped because it would impoverish the families of <ORGANIZATION> KKK </ORGANIZATION> members. He said Tuesday he would not take any money from the settlement. `` Irregardless of the court's decision, my decision not to accept one single penny of my white brothers' and sisters' possessions is a matter of conscience,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. `` It is also stooping lower than the <ORGANIZATION> KKK </ORGANIZATION> and other white supremacists to take away from them their hard-earned material possessions, simply because they brutalized us in responding to the sicknesses of our capitalistic society.'' In a letter <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> sent his fellow marchers during the trial, he said he had `` talked'' to slain civil rights leader <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and King had told him `` <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> wanted him not to sue the Klan.'' State Rep. J.E. `` Billy'' <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON>, who had opposed <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' effort to drop the lawsuit, said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' `` religion and communication with the dead should not interfere with our constitutional rights and justice. Named as defendants in the lawsuit were the Southern White Knights of the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION>, the Invisible Empire Knights of the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION> and 12 individuals. There had been 57 plaintiffs. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and three others dropped out during the trial and four others dropped out Tuesday. The jury awarded $ 50 to each of the remaining plaintiffs in compensatory damages. The rest was in punitive damages. The lawsuit had sought $ 1.5 million. Defense attorney <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Sliz </PERSON> called the verdict `` grossly unreasonable'' and said it would be appealed. `` I think there is a reasonable chance that the verdict will be set aside,'' said <PERSON> Sliz </PERSON>, attorney for <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Holland </PERSON>, Grand Dragon of the White Knights, and the Southern White Knights. `` I was surprised at the amount.'' The two Klan organizations were assessed $ 400,000 each. <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> was ordered to pay $ 50,000. Awards from 10 other individuals ranged from $ 30,000 to $ 1,000, and the 12th defendant, <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmour </PERSON>, was judged not liable. Palmour, who was shown on film with a rock in his hand during the counter-demonstration, testified that he had been `` caught up'' in the emotional confrontation. He said he did not mean to do it and apologized. It was the second major award against the <ORGANIZATION> KKK </ORGANIZATION> in less than two years. In February 1987, a federal jury in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> awarded <ORGANIZATION> Beulah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mae </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Donald </ORGANIZATION> $ 7 million from the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klans </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and six members or former members of the group after her son, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Donald </PERSON>, was beaten, strangled and hanged in a tree in 1981 at age 19. The <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> march was a forerunner to a larger demonstration a week later in which an estimated 24,000 people turned out. State, local, county and federal troops were called out to protect the marchers and prevent violence. A march into the county a year ago commemorating the anniversary of the 1987 marches was peaceful.

 <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told a persistent young reporter from a children's news program he would rather she had a baby than abort the fetus if she became pregnant through her father. `` That's a difficult question and one that does not have an easy answer, but my answer would be yes,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate told an 11-year-old reporter for `` Chidren's Express'' during a bus tour of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> last week The question-and-answer session was broadcast Tuesday on the CBS evening news. The children's show is broadcast on public television. `` But do n't you think it would ruin my whole life? ... It's not even my fault and my whole life would be ruined,'' the reporter asked. `` Well, I do n't think that would be the case at all,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` I think that if somebody had an unfortunate experience like that, it would be something that you would remember the rest of your life. `` The idea of a father abusing a daughter is a horrendous situation, one you wish that would never occur, but unfortunatley it does occur. ... It's a tragic situation.'' `` So you would want me to have the baby even though my whole life would be ruined and I could be mentally affected?'' she asked later. `` I would hope that the baby would live ...,'' he said. `` I would just like to see the baby have an opportunity.'' Democrat <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate, told another interviewer for the program: `` I would say at first that I would try very much to discourage this abortion. I believe that adoption is the alternative, and I'm an adoptive parent. ... I strongly lean towards that, but finally I think it should be a woman's choice. `` I would hope very much that she would confer with her clergyman that she would confer at length with her physician before making that kind of a choice. But finally, she makes it.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was answering abortion questions again on Tuesday in his plane to <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator was asked about a comment the previous day in which he said that he hoped if his wife were raped and became pregnant, he hoped she would elect to have the baby and not have the abortion. Asked if that was n't a pro-choice stance, he said: `` It's her choice, I told her what I would like but it's her choice. I cant tell my wife what to do in that situation.'' `` She would have that choice'' under the law as it is now written, he said.

<HEAD>Economist: Drought Not The Disaster Some Expected</HEAD>

<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The drought of 1988 was not the economic disaster some expected and might turn out to be a bonanza for some farmers, an agricultural economist said Tuesday. `` The drought likely will have minimal impact on overall farm financial conditions,'' said <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` Some people _ and I would cite those who came into 1988 with crops from previous years, and the large number of farmers who had normal or near-normal yields _ they're having one of their best years in 10.'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said there's no question that some farms were hurt, or that most farmers saw decreases in yields. Livestock producers in particular will suffer because feed prices are increasing in a period when selling prices are down. But about 60 percent of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>'s agricultural operations are crop-related, and while yields are down they are for the most part more than offset by crop price increases, he said. `` Your yields may be down 25 percent, but prices are up 30 percent or more,'' he said. `` From that perspective, while there may be a few isolated cases of the drought pushing an already stressed operation over the edge, for the most part, it'll have a neutral effect on farm financial issues. `` We'll even see ... another small rise in farm land prices,'' he said. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Durliat </PERSON>, communications director for the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, said the situation was improving, but he disagreed that some farmers are having banner years Drought-related losses `` are not going to be as widespread as originally feared,'' <PERSON> Durliat </PERSON> said. `` But you'll still hear about a lot of farmers who were put behind the eight-ball by this drought.'' Rep. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Oxley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ohio </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s assessment was generally correct. <PERSON> Oxley </PERSON> said 7 inches of rain in his district in August `` brought the corn crop back when they had given it up for dead.'' The federal government in July declared <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and several other states disaster areas, making low-interest loans available to farmers and freeing government stores of feed and federal set-aside acreage for livestock producers.

<HEAD>Moratorium Imposed on Pension Plan Reversions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHERINE RIZZO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has imposed a six-month moratorium on allowing companies to capture excess assets through termination of their overfunded pension plans. The department said it directed the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> on Monday to delay until May 1 next year approval of pension plan terminations in which excess assets would be recovered by employer sponsors of the plans. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Pension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benefit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guaranty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, corporate sponsors of defined benefit pension plans have recovered a total of $ 18.8 billion since 1980 by terminating 1,752 overfunded plans and funding their liabilities through annuities or newly established plans. In the first half of 1988, 30 companies terminated overfunded pension plans, recapturing $ 199 million in excess assets, said the <ORGANIZATION> PBGC </ORGANIZATION>, a government agency that insures defined benefit pension plan participants against losses much like the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crop </ORGANIZATION>. insures bank depositors. `` This moratorium will give <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> time to come up with legislation that will make certain that workers and retirees get a fair share of those funds,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> sponsored legislation in the last <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to heavily tax any surplus pension plan assets that revert to companies through terminations as a way to discourage the practice. The measure was stricken from the tax bill that was passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last week in exchange for an agreement by the administration to impose the moratorium. Under the current law, such reversions are allowed as long as vested participants in the plans are assured the pensions accrued to them at the time of termination. Unions and advocacy groups for the elderly and pensioners have maintained that companies should be prevented from capturing excess assets from the plans in order to insure against possible future investment losses and provide cost-of-living increases to pensioners. Business groups, whose members have used surplus pension plan assets in the past several years as a source of capital, have opposed major changes in the law. `` There is a longstanding precedent that these assets belong to the employer,'' <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilroy </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> lobbyist, said Tuesday. `` The whole issue boils down to the one question of whose assets are these.'' Since employers have to make up the difference when a pension plan runs short, they ought to be able to tap the surplus when a pension plan's investments produce higher-than-expected dividends, he said. However, <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, a lobbyist for the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> Pension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said the surpluses enable companies to say `` yes'' when retirees ask for cost-of-living increases. `` They're funded to be on-going,'' she said. `` The companies get tax breaks because they're on-going.''

 Rescuers said Tuesday they had found only 15 survivors from a ship with more than 500 people aboard that was sent to the bottom by Typhoon Rug. More than 100,000 Filipinos were made homeless by the typhoon. As of 4 a.m. Wednesday -LRB- 4 p.m. EDT Tuesday -RRB-, the typhoon was centered near latitude 16.3 north, longitude 117.5 east, in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> about 190 miles west of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> coastal city of <LOCATION> Dagupan </LOCATION>. The government weather service said <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON>'s maximum sustained winds had decreased to 93 mph and that the typhoon was moving west-northwest at about 4 mph. A coast guard cutter was dispatched early Wednesday to port of <LOCATION> Cebu </LOCATION>, 100 miles from where the <PERSON> Dona </PERSON> <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> went down, to search for missing passengers. That would bring to three the number of major vessels searching for survivors of the <PERSON> Dona </PERSON> <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>, a 2,845-ton passenger liner that replaced the Dona Paz on the Sulpicio Lines run between <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tacloban </LOCATION>. The Dona Paz sank Dec. 20, 1987, after a collision off <LOCATION> Mindoro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> with a tanker, and only 26 people were rescued. The official death toll was 1,749, but some estimates said 3,000 died because many deck passengers making the holiday trip to <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> were not on the manifest. In suburban <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Philippine helicopters rescued hundreds of people stranded on rooftops and in trees by the flooding <LOCATION> Marikina </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Coast Guard officials said the Dona <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> sank Monday in the <LOCATION> Visayas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> about 300 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> while it was making the Manila-Tacloban run. It was carrying 451 passengers and 60 crew members from <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Tacloban </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Leyte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> when it radioed a distress call, said <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> Go, general manager of <ORGANIZATION> Sulpicio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>. Lt. <PERSON> Rey </PERSON> <PERSON> Esguerra </PERSON> of the coast guard station in <LOCATION> Cebu </LOCATION> said rescuers had found 11 survivors on <LOCATION> Maripipi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and another small island, and four people were found alive in the water. <PERSON> Vicente </PERSON> <PERSON> Gambito </PERSON>, vice president of Sulpicio, put the number rescued at 18. There was no explanation for the discrepancy. The <PERSON> Dona </PERSON> <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> was authorized to carry about 1,400 passengers and crew. Officials reported 25 people missing because of Typhoon Ruby at <LOCATION> Cagayan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oro </LOCATION>, a coastal city on <LOCATION> Mindanao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, and 15 unaccounted for after a crowded bus plunged into a swollen river Monday in <LOCATION> Antique </LOCATION> province. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> said 26 bodies were recovered from the bus. Floods on <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION> and other islands caused landslides and washed away bridges. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Dominguez </PERSON>, the agriculture secretary, said preliminary estimates put damage to crops at nearly $ 46 million, but casualty and damage reports were incomplete because of poor communications. Figures compiled from the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and government agencies showed 26 dead in <LOCATION> Antique </LOCATION> province, 20 in <LOCATION> Occidental </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mindoro </LOCATION>, 15 in <LOCATION> Zamboanga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sur </LOCATION>, 11 in <LOCATION> Cagayan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oro </LOCATION>, 11 in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Marikina </LOCATION> suburb, six on <LOCATION> Camiguin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, four in <LOCATION> Iloilo </LOCATION>, three in <ORGANIZATION> Nueva </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ecija </ORGANIZATION>, two in <LOCATION> Surigao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and one each in <LOCATION> Pampanga </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bulacan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON>'s center passed about 50 miles east of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> early Tuesday and swept into the <PERSON> Tarlac </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Bulacan </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Nueva </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ecija </ORGANIZATION> provinces, the archipelago's main rice-growing region, the national weather service reported. Meteorologists said more than nine inches of rain fell in 24 hours at the <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> airport. Domestic flights were canceled but international service continued. President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> visited flooded <LOCATION> Marikina </LOCATION>, the hardest-hit district in the <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> area, on Tuesday and met with some of the thousands who fled their homes. Two American helicopters from <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> joined Filipino soldiers and civilian volunteers in rescuing stranded people. A Philippine navy landing craft and a hospital vessel capsized in heavy seas Monday at <LOCATION> Zamboangak </LOCATION>, but no casualties were reported. A tugboat owned by the state-run <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> sank off the <LOCATION> Bataan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, also with no casualties. Schools, government offices, the two stock exchanges and many private businesses in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> were closed Tuesday and the government said schools would not open Wednesday because of widespread flooding and power outages. Some schools were being used as evacuation centers. At least 110,000 of the nation's 56 million people were left homeless, officials reported. The government said 400,000 people were `` affected,'' meaning their homes were damaged or destroyed. Maj. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Crist </PERSON>, a spokesman at <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, 50 miles north of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, reported no major structural damage there, but said some aircraft were evacuated to an undisclosed `` safe location.'' Typhoon Ruby was the 18th typhoon or tropical storm to strike the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> this year and the strongest on <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION> since <PERSON> Patsy </PERSON> killed at least 175 people in 1970.

<HEAD>Anne Frank Letters Sold At Auction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two letters and a postcard written by <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> and her sister, <PERSON> Margot </PERSON>, were sold to an anonymous bidder at an auction Tuesday for $ 150,000. The young Jewish Holocaust victims mailed the notes along with two photographs to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> pen pals in 1940, a month before <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> invaded the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, prompting the <PERSON> Franks </PERSON> to go into hiding. The successful bidder said he represented `` a number of institutions'' but would not specify further, said <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Swann </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Galleries </ORGANIZATION>, the auction house. However, the bidder did say he would announce on Wednesday the name of the institution where the letters will be kept, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. Also on the auction block were pages from <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Edison </PERSON>'s notebooks, <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>'s certificate of conversion to <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION>, and a collection of <PERSON> Greta </PERSON> <PERSON> Garbo </PERSON> correspondence Bidding for the Frank collection was over in five minutes. <PERSON> Swann </PERSON> had predicted bidding would exceed $ 30,000 but could not estimate how high it would go because nothing written by <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> had ever been auctioned. Among the bidders for the letters was actress <PERSON> Whoopi </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>, one of hundreds who participated in the auction by telephone. About 250 people attended the sale in person. The correspondence between the two sisters and their pen pals in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> was dated April 27 and April 29, 1940. It described the girls' life at home and school in <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> <PERSON> Margot </PERSON> wrote that `` having a frontier with <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and being a small country we never feel safe.'' A month after the letters were sent, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> invaded the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Franks </PERSON> went into hiding but were later discovered and sent to concentration camps. <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>'s diary, published in 1952, carries a poignant account of their life in hiding. The <PERSON> Franks </PERSON>' pen-pals were sisters from <LOCATION> Danville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>: <PERSON> Juanita </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>, 11, who was <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>'s age, and <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>, 15, who was <PERSON> Margot </PERSON>'s age. The <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> sisters wrote back, but never heard from the <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> girls again. After the war, they wrote again, and <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>'s father replied, explaining that he was the only one in his family to survive the war. The Wagner sisters, now living in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, decided earlier this year to sell the letters. `` We had been discussing what I was going to do to retire. I've never really saved very much,'' said <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>, who was reached by telephone at her home in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area. Miss <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> also said she plans to donate part of the money from the sale to <ORGANIZATION> Wayfarer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit organization she founded nine years ago to ship books to missionaries. She and her sister hope to travel to <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> to visit the house where <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> hid with her family, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> said. `` We'd worried about her during the war but never dreamed that she was suffering.'' Also sold at the auction were several <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> autographs, including her certificate of conversion to <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION>, which took place just prior to her marriage to playwright <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. The certificate was bought by a private collector for $ 7,000, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. A handwritten letter of condolence from <PERSON> Emily </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> to the husband of a friend who died brought $ 8,000 from a dealer, he said. Seventy-six pages of handwritten notes by <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Edison </PERSON> brought $ 32,000. <PERSON> Edison </PERSON> compiled the manuscript, which concerns his travels, jobs and inventions, for use by his official biographers, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. A collection of correspondence from <PERSON> Greta </PERSON> <PERSON> Garbo </PERSON> was bought by a collector for $ 9,500, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said.

 Two photographs of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostages found in the luggage of a Lebanese woman at <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>'s airport are reproductions, police said Tuesday. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said they doubted that photos and documents carried by the woman were part of an effort to free Americans held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` It might be prudent to view this with a certain degree of skepticism,'' said one American official, speaking on condition of anonymity. Police released a third photo the woman was carrying, saying it also was a reproduction. They could not identify the subject, a thin-faced man with a dark, curly beard. The other two photos were of hostages <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alann </PERSON> <PERSON> Steen </PERSON>. Authorities said the woman was to give the pictures and several documents _ including a letter bearing <PERSON> Steen </PERSON>'s name _ to <PERSON> Aldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Anghessa </PERSON>, an Italian arms trader with links to Swiss and Italian intelligence agencies. He was to deliver them to a third party, but authorities would not say who that might be. The woman, identified as <PERSON> Aline </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Rizkallah </PERSON>, 36, was arrested at <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Linate </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> last Thursday after arriving from <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Police reported also finding $ 1,000 in counterfeit <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bills and 1.7 ounces of heroin on her. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, including an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> representative, were en route to <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> to investigate. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, who saw a photocopy of the letter, said it was `` not in normal English that a native English-speaker would use,'' but said that did not necessarily mean it was a fake. <PERSON> Achille </PERSON> <PERSON> Serra </PERSON>, head of the anti-terrorism unit of <ORGANIZATION> Milan </ORGANIZATION>'s police, told reporters that if the handwriting turns out not to be <PERSON> Steen </PERSON>'s, `` things change a lot. We would be talking about a fraud.'' It was not clear who would have been the target of a possible swindle. The photo of <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, appeared to be a copy of one issued in August by the pro-Iranian Islamic Jihad. The picture of <PERSON> Steen </PERSON>, who is believed held by Islamic Jihad for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION>, was the same as one released last February. The woman carried letters for <PERSON> Anghessa </PERSON> and an Italian prisoner in <LOCATION> Massa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Serra </PERSON> said. Both were in coded Italian which police were trying to decipher, he said. The woman, apparently a courier, said she was to receive about $ 4,000 from <LOCATION> Anghessa </LOCATION>, police said. He denied it. <PERSON> Serra </PERSON> said police had identified the man who supplied the woman with the pictures and documents and were considering going to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to question him. Islamic Jihad denied Monday it was connected with the woman. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Steen </PERSON> are among nine Americans held by pro-Iranian extremist factions linked to <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> was seized in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on March 16, 1985. <PERSON> Steen </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, was kidnapped Jan. 24, 1987 at <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, where he taught. Three Britons, and Irishman and an Italian also are missing and believed held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Five men, including one believed to be a leader in a multibillion-dollar Colombian drug cartel, were indicted Tuesday on charges they conspired to import more than a ton of cocaine a week. A federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> issued the indictment despite reported death threats, officials said. <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON> and four alleged underlings in the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel were charged with conspiring with undercover agents, who posed as brokers, to import 2,200 pounds of cocaine every eight days into the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> area, authorities said. Since <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON>, 47, lives in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, federal authorities said his prosecution is unlikely because there is no extradition treaty between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. `` Only by taking off the leadership of these cartels can we hope to put a crimp into these organizations,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON>. <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> said he was optimistic that an extradition treaty between the two countries would be negotiated in the future so Gacha could be brought to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to face the charges. Three of the defendants, who were identified as employees of the cartel's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> distribution operation, were arrested in July when federal agents seized 1,350 pounds of cocaine near <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guardia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, the first shipment in the sting operation. The fifth defendant, <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Vegas </PERSON>, who was identified as a lieutenant in the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel, also lives in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and remains unapprehended. The men were charged with operating a continuing criminal enterprise, conspiracy to import cocaine and conspiracy to distribute cocaine. The criminal enterprise and the possession charges carry a maximum penalty of up to life in prison upon conviction. The defendants could be fined up to $ 6 million. <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON> also was named Tuesday in a separate indictment filed in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s federal court that charged him and six others with one count of conspiracy to import cocaine. He was identified as one of three leaders of the cartel, which is named for the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> city in which it is based. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stutman </PERSON>, the head of the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office, described <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON> as `` the most active member'' of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel, which he said dominates the cocaine market in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and several <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> cities. <PERSON> Stutman </PERSON> said his agency had received intelligence reports from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON> had issued death threats against <PERSON> Stutman </PERSON>, Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> and other law enforcement officials for actions taken against the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> organization. `` The more they threaten, the more we'll go after them,'' <PERSON> Stutman </PERSON> said.

One reason Filipino authorities may change their mind, the officials said, is that the repair yard is losing money. The enterprise is a joint venture of Philippine and Japanese interests.

 Two trapped whales reversed course and headed back toward shore, frustrating efforts to coax them toward open water, as scientists probed an ice ridge for a weak spot that Soviet icebreakers could attack. `` It's discouraging,'' federal biologist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Withrow </PERSON> said Monday as the mammals, apparently spooked by a shoal that has stymied progress for three days, retreated about 800 yards. `` Why come back here when they know it's open up there?'' The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> gray whales struggled up for air, tiring quickly as they poked their way through large slabs of <LOCATION> Beaufort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> ice and thick slush left by efforts to carve them a path to freedom. At one point, the 27-foot-long whale _ the smaller of the two _ rested the end of its huge snout on the edge of the ice.

 Frozen corpses of two seamen who died during a doomed Arctic expedition in 1848 contain bacteria that show unexpected resistance to antibiotics developed more than 120 years later, scientists say. Because there is evidence that lead poisoning killed the men, the researchers speculate that heavy metal pollutants, not just overuse of antibiotics, may play a role in creating disease germs that survive drugs. The proliferation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria has become a major problem, especially in Third World nations where the drugs are used indiscriminately, killing vulnerable bacteria and allowing resistant bacteria to reproduce.

<HEAD>CBS' New, But Not Improved `Van Dyke Show'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 After canning the original pilot for `` The Van Dyke Show,'' premiering on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> tonight, the producers seem to have slapped together a replacement from one of those kits at the sitcom store. This is like do-it-yourself comedy. The actors ought to have blank dialogue balloons over their heads. The audience could do just as well filling in the predictable lines as the writers. Meanwhile, the producers of <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s new series, `` <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON>,'' which premieres tonight after `` <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON>,'' also had to re-shoot their pilot. The new version was n't available for review _ usually a dead giveaway a show has serious troubles, especially since the network willingly showed critics `` The Van Dyke Show.'' Granted, this is the network that canceled `` <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s Place''; perhaps they're in no position to judge <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON> and <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> were co-stars in the 1960s hit `` The <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON> Show.'' <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> had her own hugely successful `` The <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> Show'' a decade later. CBS hopes these comedy veterans can help shore up lagging ratings and ease a dearth of half-hour comedies. But CBS apparently took no hint from `` Life With <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON>.'' It's painful, not reassuring, to see beloved stars come back in bad shows. The original pilot for `` <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON>,'' then known only as `` The Untitled <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> <PERSON> Project </PERSON>,'' was shown to critics last summer but was re-cast, apparently because the husband, played by <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> -LRB- no relation -RRB-, was so darned dull. He is now played by <PERSON> Denis </PERSON> <PERSON> Arndt </PERSON>. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> plays a sophisticated Manhattanite who works for <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> and has recently married <PERSON> Nick </PERSON>, a blue-collar Jersey guy. The original pilot followed their courtship. In the new version, they have been married for a few weeks. Her mom is a liberal. His is a conservative. Tonight's plot centers more on <PERSON> Annie </PERSON>'s job in which she meets a disabled <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran. Does it sound like someone's throwing in the kitchen sink here, or what We have seen <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON>'s show. He plays <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Burgess </PERSON>, a big-name song-and-dance man who moves to the small <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> town where his son, <PERSON> Matt </PERSON>, played by <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON>'s real-life son, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, runs a local theater. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON> is a talented and likeable guy, but he does n't look very comfortable here. But then, who would? <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> has a typical sitcom wife, <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Kari </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizer </PERSON> -RRB-, and a typical sitcom son, <PERSON> Noah </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Sullivan </PERSON> -RRB-. At home, the elder <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON> engages in the slapstick that was his trademark on the old `` <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON> Show,'' only this time, instead of falling over an ottoman, he tries to climb into his grandson's bunkbed _ for a long, long time. Down at <PERSON> Matt </PERSON>'s theater, there are typical sitcom extras: smart-aleck office assistant <PERSON> Jillian </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Maura </PERSON> <PERSON> Tierney </PERSON> -RRB-, aspiring actor-cleaning boy <PERSON> Erick </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Scherrer </PERSON> -RRB-, and a wise old stage manager, <PERSON> Doc </PERSON>, played by <PERSON> Whitman </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayo </PERSON>, who played <PERSON> Grady </PERSON> on `` Sanford and Son.'' The show was directed by talented veteran <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandrich </PERSON> -LRB- `` The Cosby Show'' -RRB-, and the studio is run by <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinker </PERSON>, formerly known as Mr. Quality. But the writing is weak, credited to executive producers <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Bobrick </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>. Go out and hire someone, guys. Here's one of the funnier lines: When <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON> the elder comes down for breakfast, he notes he not only has destroyed the child's bunkbed, but also the rug _ by spilling an aquarium onto it `` Is my fish OK?'' queries <PERSON> Noah </PERSON>. `` He's fine,'' says <PERSON> Dick </PERSON>. `` Er, just do n't flush.'' The producers may be saying the same thing to <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> in a few weeks.

<HEAD>Male Domination Called Result Of Sin</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Religious feminists fume at that old passage in Genesis 3:16 about women, `` Your desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you.'' However, no less a religious authority than Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> says the passage refers to a flawed condition in humanity and it is not supposed to be that way. `` This ` domination' indicates the disturbance and the loss of the stability of that fundamental equality which the man and woman possess in the ` unity of the two,''' he says. It results from original sin, he says, from the human attempt to be supreme and outrival God. `` The overcoming of this evil inheritance is, generation after generation, the task of every human being, whether man or women,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> says. Although his recent letter on women plainly kept them barred from his church's priesthood, it still hacked away at some of the old religious biases against them. In fact, he describes woman as the `` biblical exemplar'' from the beginning of history to its close. He notes that at the end of time, she is portrayed in Revelation 12:1 as `` a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of stars.'' `` One can say she is a woman of cosmic scale, on a scale with the whole of creation,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> says of the symbolism, marveling at woman's high role. `` God entrusts the human being to her in a special way.'' The pope says the exceptional womanly prerogative also shows up in a woman being the means by which divinity joined humanity in Christ `` born to a woman,'' <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nazareth </LOCATION>. `` Thus there begins the central event, the key event in the history of salvation,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> says. `` A woman is to be found at the center of this salvific event.'' Although the pope's Sept. 30 teaching letter, `` Mulieris Dignitatem'' -LRB- The Dignity of Women -RRB- drew scant attention and only mixed reactions, it offers some rare papal rebukes to common religious slights against women. He even tackles the pervasive masculine images of God _ a regular and controversial target of Christian feminists _ declaring that God's creativity is `` neither `` ` masculine' nor ` feminine','' but `` totally divine.'' While humanity is created in `` likeness'' to God, there also is a `` non-likeness'' to him, the `` Different One'' or `` totally Other,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> says. He adds that the Bible's characteristic anthropomorphic way of speaking about God refers to his `` fatherhood,'' but that does n't mean maleness as in human fatherhood He points out that various Scripture passages attribute to God both masculine and feminine qualities, sometimes picturing him as a caring, comforting mother. `` Thus every element of human generation which is proper to man, and every element which is proper to woman, namely human ` fatherhood' and ` motherhood,' bear within itself a likeness to, or analogy with the divine ` generating' which is in God,'' the pope says. He says that women possess `` essential equality'' with men, that both `` are human beings to an equal degree, both are created in God's image.'' While the biblical narrative says that sin was initiated by the woman, Eve, followed by man, <PERSON> Adam </PERSON>, the pope rejects that twist putting the prior blame on women, declaring: `` There is no doubt that, independent of this ` distinction of roles,' that first sin is the sin of man, created by <PERSON> God </PERSON> as male and female. It is also the sin of the ` first parents' ... `` As the author of the evil of sin, the human being _ man and woman _ is affected by it.'' Besides emphasizing the role of a woman, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, as the channel by which God entered humanity in <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>, the pope pictures women as key figures in his ministry, and him as a sort of the original women's liberator <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> `` became a promoter of women's true dignity and of the vocation corresponding to this dignity,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> says. `` At times this caused wonder and surprise, often to the point of scandal.'' Furthermore, the pope notes, women played major roles in his ministry: Women supported it with their means. The Samaritan woman became his first mass evangelist. Women stood by him at the cross while male apostles hid in fear. In `` this most arduous test of faith and fidelity the women proved stronger than the apostles,'' the pope observes. Women also were the first to report the empty tomb after the resurrection and the first to meet the risen Christ and proclaim it to others. Women take an unusual precedence, as the pope describes it, but he still sees the priesthood as limited to males.

<HEAD>A Letter to Tovarich</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Capitalism is an ingenious creator, a constant revolution in which new destroys old, a riotous, unruly process that proceeds with no respect for central planning. Those observations come from an open letter to <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> citizens, now beginning to experiment with capitalism, from an American corporate economist. It concludes with the assurance that `` you have our sympathy in full measure.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffen </PERSON>, vice president and corporate economist for <ORGANIZATION> Aetna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casualty </ORGANIZATION>, wrote the letter to a mythical tovarich, or comrade, as a means of making some points about capitalism that escape even Americans. Soviet leaders are misinformed, says <PERSON> Griffen </PERSON>, if they believe the party can control capitalism to meet party needs. If Soviet leaders are able to graft private enterprise onto Russian rootstock, `` they will have no hope of controlling its growth to conform to a previously established acceptable norm,'' says <PERSON> Griffen </PERSON>. `` If you import real capitalism, tovarich, be prepared for riotous unruly growth that pays little heed and no respect to plot plans,'' he writes in a company publication, `` AEconomics,'' reminding Russians that capitalism builds but also destroys. He cites <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumpeter </PERSON>, one of the greatest of Western economists, who expressed respect for capitalism's power to build, but observed also that it has an enormous power to tear down what it had previously built. `` Count on it, tovarich, capitalism can tear down what you have built, too, and surely will do so if given half a chance. Our bombers and our missiles can not so thoroughly change your landscape as capitalism can.'' He explains: `` Who can say what capitalism will create in your country to take the place of what it destroys. `` The enterprise system within which we live provides incentives to people to follow their dreams, to create the life they wish to live and to learn how to support it. `` When millions of people are free to behave in this manner, ingeniouus solutions to problems appear as if by magic. Amazing efficiencies are discovered. Human needs and wants are fulfilled better, faster and less expensively _ capitalism has survived because it serves people better than any other social arrangement.'' But, again, it has little respect for tradition. As capitalism reinvents itself it tramples on old products, businesses, jobs, ways of doing business, ways of living, he says. It is a process of creative destruction. It precedes a long wave or surge of progress. It happened in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> during the Great Depression of the 1930s, says <PERSON> Griffen </PERSON>. The people of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, who enjoy one of the world's highest standards of living, even now complain about the loss of the old ways In <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, he says, you may find many examples of misguided capitalism and little of its creativity. Birthing pangs are felt in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> _ in whatever nations `` rotate through the headlines.'' They are felt in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and always will be so long as the process of revolutionary renewal continues. The automotive industry, for instance, had been in a depression as a result of new ways of making cars with new materials by different people in distant countries. `` Jobs have been lost in automobile companies and in the unions and suppliers that deal with them. Local communities have been affected. Old factories have become new shopping malls or condominiums.'' The same is true in agriculture and finance, says <PERSON> Griffen </PERSON>, observing that `` recently it has reached an intensity as to have touched nearly everyone's life.'' He observes that the power of the market has thrown hundreds of thousands out of work, but it has also created millions of jobs. Statistically, he says, this is an enormous net gain, `` but for those whose old way of life was disrupted there has been a real cost not measured in gross national product.'' Will it work in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>? <PERSON> Griffen </PERSON> writes tovarich: `` Your leaders hope the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> can maintain control of this revolution, but that seems unlikely. Russian capitalism will create power centers, interest groups and spheres of influence too numerous to count let alone control.'' The capitalist way of life, he reminds his mythical comrade, is a diametric opposite to totalitarian or authoritarian central control. `` Ask anyone in the West: Capitalism produces the constantly revolutionary society.'' Only temporarily, he says, are central control and capitalism reconcilable. `` Your leaders are now yielding to the realization of which is the greater force.''

<HEAD>Church Council Threatened By Financial Crunch</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hard financial times have hit the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, and officers say it's going to have to change its ways to keep going. `` I do n't think it's going to fold,'' said <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Sohl </PERSON>, who chairs the finance committee of the country's largest ecumenical organization. `` But it ca n't keep doing the same as it's doing now. It has to change what it's doing to bring it in line with what it can afford.'' Measures to deal with the financial crisis were to be considered at meetings of a special coordinating group this weekend and of the council's governing board Nov. 1-4 in <LOCATION> Tarrytown </LOCATION>, N.Y. The 260 board members represent the 32 denominations making up the council, including most major <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> and Eastern Orthodox bodies. They total about 40 million members. While the budgetary squeeze is described as severe and threatening, an oft-repeated view is that the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, even if dismantled, would have to be immediately recreated. `` There is too much work that the churches need to do together,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Sohl </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Several factors brought on the crunch, notably either stagnant or reduced denominational allocations to the council, which historically have lagged behind inflation and rising costs. Also, because monies received are needed at once instead of going temporarily into an investment fund, interest dropped sharply. Beyond that, controversy over increased levies on <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the council's big relief agency, to support council general services has caused some denominations to quit channeling relief funds through CWS. The council `` is shooting itself in the foot,'' said <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Rumer </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION>, which has halted routing of relief money through CWS for the time being. CWS, with relief operations around the world, is by far the council's largest operation, taking up about 70 percent of a $ 52.9 million net budget. The Rev. <PERSON> Arie </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brouwer </PERSON>, the council's general secretary and chief administrator, says part of the trouble seems to be disenchantment within some mainline denominations that are mainstays of the council. Several of them, such as the Presbyterian Church -LRB- USA -RRB-, the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> have all suffered membership losses in recent years. Since its founding in 1950, the council has been a regular target of conservative groups, which have criticized it for stands on social issues, but such attacks have waned and were not considered crucial to the financial difficulties. However, with denominational concerns turning inward, taking precedence over ecumenical activities, the council has been been forced steadily to cut staff and program, most sharply in recent years. The current professional staff of 83 is expected to be cut to 61 for 1989. Previously, that staff total had dropped from 187 in 1968 to 105 in 1975. The council's associated mission medical office, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> unit that provides medical evaluations of missionaries before and after overseas service, is to cease operations Dec. 31. But plans were under way to create a new medical office in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> in conjunction with <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, which would assume the medical reviews of missionaries. Other new cutbacks include eliminating CWS' family life and population program, closing the council development office and merging its national and international disaster-response offices.

 The City of Light sits on a subterranean city of darkness, a vast network of stone quarries that has given refuge to scoundrels, saints and the bones of 6 million souls. It is where the Phantom of the Opera set up house. Here is a report by an <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> Correspondent who visited the catacombs.

 The Phantom was laid to rest long ago in the cellars of the Opera, but figures nearly as macabre still haunt the catacombs that wind through the belly of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> like entrails and conceal millions of human bones. Each weekend, dozens of people slip out of their city skins and into the maze on which the city rests. They descend as far as 90 feet into a world where night is eternal, the unexpected waits at each turn and the game is to the fearless. Some are history buffs seeking the dank breath of ancient <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, others are adventurers and still others inhabit a marginal world whether above ground or below. They are called `` cataphiles'' and are drawn, as if by enchantment, to the darkness beneath the City of Light. They tread in the footsteps of sorcerers, bandits, smugglers, the quick and the sly who haunted the tunnels centuries ago. Many who spend time below use nicknames _ `` Destroy,'' `` Calamity'' or `` Professor <PERSON> Sato </PERSON>'' _ and dress in exaggerated punk or skinhead style. The eternal, eerie silence and stillness enclose a voyager who weaves through the sand-colored maze of galleries, rooms, nooks and niches as if pulled along by the flashlight beam. Fossils of ancient creatures are imbedded in walls nicked by the pickaxes of workers long dead. Minuscule stalactites have formed on the dripping ceilings of what once were quarries for the limestone that built <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, most of them worked in the Middle Ages. During World War II, the catacombs were bunkers for the German occupiers and hideouts for the French Resistance. They have been a blessing to mushroom growers who harvested tons of `` champignons de <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>'' each day from the murky gardens. `` It's a milieu that is such an anachronism compared with the rest of the capital,'' said Inspector <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Saratte </PERSON>, director of police operations in the catacombs. It has been against the law to go underground since 1955 because of risks both to travelers and the city's foundations, but <PERSON> Saratte </PERSON> said: `` It's an adventure ... so everyone goes down, from sons of Cabinet ministers to little punks.'' Quarries of <LOCATION> Lutecian </LOCATION> limestone running under southern <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, just a corner of the 188 miles of accessible catacombs, are assigned to the dead. The galleries are lined with the skulls and other bones of 6 million people, some guillotined in the French Revolution but most merely overflow from the crowded cemeteries of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Anne-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Leparmentier </PERSON>, a geologist with the General Inspection of the Quarries, the city agency in charge since the 18th century, said a `` reserve'' of bones is kept in other sections of the quarries, but `` sometimes a skull disappears'' now that the cataphiles have come. People have had regular access since the last century to the bone caverns at the <LOCATION> Place </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Denfert-Rochereau </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and regular tours are conducted. The rest of the catacombs are reached by manhole, under cover of darkness, down a steel ladder to another world. Going underground became a fad more than a decade ago when students of the <ORGANIZATION> Ecole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> des </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mines </ORGANIZATION> nearly made it a ritual. `` We ended up spending days finding people lost inside,'' <PERSON> Saratte </PERSON> said, so all but eight of about 300 accesses to the catacombs have been soldered shut. The quarries are the lowest level of subterranean <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, which also is honeycombed with subway lines and 1,313 miles of navigable sewers. The vast underworld inspired <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>, and later <PERSON> Gaston </PERSON> <PERSON> Leroux </PERSON>, whose `` Phantom of the Opera'' hid out in `` that infernal underground maze.'' Around one corner is a bath carved into the rock by quarry workers centuries ago, around the next an open well that may descend to the center of <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. Around still another, `` Lost in the catas. Help!'' is scrawled on the wall. Some writings reek of threat or foreboding: `` This is the domain of the Klan,'' `` Avenue of the Black Mass,'' `` I'm Dead.'' A shuffling sound comes from a corridor nearby. The path forks and the swamp route beckons. Travelers slosh through the ancient mud of <LOCATION> Lutecia </LOCATION>, as <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> was called in Roman times. Eras collide in the catacombs. Punks, skinheads and weekend revelers hold all-night seances. In Room Z, a large, confusing, amorphous cavity reached by slithering on the stomach through a narrow tunnel, the walls are scrolls of obscenities, swastikas and death wails. Subterranean <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> is `` a very particular little world, a little planet all its own'' where groups of regulars establish zones of influence, said <PERSON> Saratte </PERSON>, the police inspector. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON>, who uses only his first name, said: `` This world is divided into two races, the tourists and the cataphiles. The tourists are a hated race. ... You have to do everything to chase them out.'' `` Actually, it is a rather hostile milieu'' where `` criminals do n't think of hiding out, said <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Laroche </PERSON>, another geologist for the city quarries agency. Since the beginning, the quarries of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> have attracted those either in hiding or in search of the celestial or the damned. <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Denis </PERSON>, patron saint of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, said Mass in the quarries during the Christian persecution, according to <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lacordaire </PERSON>'s book `` The Secret History of Subterranean <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. Some 13th century bandits hid under the Chateau de Vauvert, replaced long ago by the <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gardens </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lacordaire </PERSON> said. Sorcerers used the quarries for black masses, especially during the 1348 plague that filled the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> cemeteries and caused the living to search for solace in the occult. In the last century, merchants used the catacombs to smuggle untaxed black-market goods to clients. Official concern now centers on preserving the natural beauty of the quarries and fears that unauthorized travelers will harm the city foundations. `` There have always been cataphiles, but perhaps in the past they were more respectful,'' <PERSON> Laroche </PERSON> said. `` It is not a sacred place, but it is our patrimony.'' Over-ambitious excavations weakened the subterranean infrastructure. There were reports a century ago of the earth swallowing homes on the Boulevard St. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> and neighboring streets. <PERSON> Laroche </PERSON> said the last fatal accident was a 1961 cave-in at <LOCATION> Clamart </LOCATION>, a southern suburb, that killed 20 people. Authorities began mapping and reinforcing the quarries in the mid-18th century and do so today when the need arises. Quarrying has been prohibited since 1788.

<TEXT>
 No job is perfect, not even being a member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. But once you're there, it's a difficult job to give up. No member of the freshman class of 1986 plans to leave voluntarily. Freshmen congressmen cite the slow-moving seniority system, the unpredictable floor schedule and canceled airplane reservations and speaking engagements as some of the headaches that go with the job. But along with that is the satisfaction of being a party to major pieces of legislation. Here are some impressions from five freshmen:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 `` Guys who control the place have been here 25, 30, 35, 40 years and for a young guy coming in, boy, that's a long time,'' said Rep. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastert </PERSON>, R-Ill. <PERSON> Hastert </PERSON>, 46, served in the state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> where he became minority spokesman on the House Appropriations Committee The husky, affable former teacher and restaurateur likes <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> but at times recalls a bit wistfully the statehouse clout he surrendered to get here. `` I could pick up a phone and have the director of children and family services, public health or public aid in my office in five minutes if I needed help or to work with a problem,'' he reminisced. These days, `` I pick up the phone and go through the hierarchy,'' <PERSON> Hastert </PERSON> says. `` It's just a bigger place. You ca n't be in everybody's office in five minutes. I realize that.'' Still, he finds himself troubled by `` the time people bide here before they have a big impact on their committees.'' To <PERSON> Hastert </PERSON>, the highlight of his first two years in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was the budget summit at which lawmakers agreed on a formula to curb spending. But he says cutting the deficit remains a major challenge. `` Otherwise, I think we're headed for a fiscal train wreck.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 It's true that Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON>, D-Md., has an easier time getting home than Midwestern lawmakers who must scramble to keep airplane reservations when floor sessions meander unexpectedly into the night But <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON>, a former professional basketball player, said representing a district just 30 minutes from the Capitol does n't ease the hectic pace `` The proximity of my district to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> doubles it,'' he said, as he is often expected to be in two places at once. `` You plan lots of things in your district assuming that you'll be out of session at reasonable hours or that you wo n't be in session on a certain day And then all of a sudden that changes and there are very difficult things to cancel.'' Sending an aide to apologize to impatient constituents is a risky move for a lawmaker who won his seat by just 428 votes. To make the strain even worse, <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON> had vowed to compile a 100 percent attendance record on votes _ a rarity even among the most conscientious congressmen. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> sometimes takes meaningless procedural votes, such as approving the previous day's journal, and lawmakers secure about re-election sometimes pass up such time-consuming formalities <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON> achieved that 100 percent record this term but says it ca n't last forever. The one-time <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> scholar began his term by being elected president of the Democratic freshman class. `` There are n't many jobs in the world where you can work on issues of such great diversity,'' <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON> said. But he finds himself chafing at times by the slowness with which Capitol Hill changes its longstanding traditions. `` I think they could move this institution more toward the 20th century,'' he said.

 Rep. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Grandy </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, was best known as The Love Boat's <PERSON> Gopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> when he asked <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> voters to send him to the House He assured them, though, that `` there's a long-pants version of <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Grandy </PERSON>.'' Two years later, the Harvard-educated former actor said he has been `` pleasantly surprised because there's an old rubric that says a freshman's main goal is to get re-elected and you should be seen and not heard and there's very little you can accomplish.'' Not true, the 40-year-old former <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> aide said after two years on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` I've worked on every major piece of legislation that has come out of the ag committee, including working on three major conferences, drought, credit and trade bill,'' he says. Not that any freshman was a prime mover in fashioning those bills. But seniority-heavy lawmakers once known as the `` Old Bulls'' of <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> are more willing to let newcomers participate, said <PERSON> Grandy </PERSON>. `` I just hope that I'm always a Young Turk and never become an <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bull </LOCATION>,'' he added. And the hours? `` For anybody who lives west of, I think <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, this is a killer schedule.''

 Rep. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelosi </PERSON>, D-Calif., came to <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> early in 1987 to fill a vacancy The daughter of a one-time <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> congressman and long on the fringes of national politics, the newest freshman found no surprises. `` Surprise is a word that for politicians and people in public life is a very rare occurrence,'' said <PERSON> Pelosi </PERSON>, whose district encompasses all but a sliver of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` You hope for the best, you prepare for the worst and you are very rarely surprised.'' What would she change? A long pause. `` Actually,'' she said. `` I have a lot of respect for this institution. `` It's true, it would be easier if we had more certainty about the schedule, but it's in the nature of the place and I like the fast pace and I can cope with it,'' she said. `` There are all kinds of ways to get a job done.'' High on her agenda was federal assistance for AIDS victims. She applauds congressional approval of such a bill. `` I feel very pleased about that because of what it will mean for people infected with the AIDS virus,'' she said. `` And there is plenty more to do.''

 Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunning </PERSON>, R-Ky., won 224 games as a major league pitcher, including a pair of no hitters He came to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> from the <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Any surprises? `` It's only the numbers,'' <PERSON> Bunning </PERSON> said. `` You have to add three zeros to everything.'' He did find himself a bit disappointed in `` the lack of input.'' `` I think the committee chairman and the ranking member seem to have more control than they ought to,'' <PERSON> Bunning </PERSON> said. `` That is, not much legislation is altered at the full committee level and particularly in Banking.'' In the <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, he said, `` there was n't much you could do, even if you tried your darndest and I tried in certain instances.'' Would he change anything? <PERSON> Bunning </PERSON> cited proxy voting in committees _ a practice under which senior lawmakers collect the `` proxies'' of absent members and vote them on bills and amendments. Without proxy voting, he said, `` you would have to show up and vote ... and the committee chairman could not vote 15 proxies who were absent and just work his will on everything.'' He said it was hard to put his finger on any single high point over the last two years. `` I'm a well-trained professional who does n't get too high or too low,'' he said. `` That comes from my athletic background, I believe, where some you win, some you lose and some get rained out.''

 <PERSON> Isadore </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>, founder and chairman of the Four Seasons luxury hotel chain, is n't troubled by the growing competition at the top end of the market. `` We've evolved over 25 years,'' he said in an interview at corporate headquarters here. `` They look at us and copy a lot of what we've done.'' Indeed, the move by several major hotel chains into the luxury market has actually helped Four Seasons by putting huge advertising budgets to work promoting quality and whetting the public's appetite for the kind of services that have made a name for <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>. `` We decided a long time ago what we thought was going to be our strength,'' the trim and fit executive said. `` The other companies still do n't do it _ and that's the service. It's the consistency and quality of the people you hire.'' Four Seasons _ with 21 properties in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> _ has helped set the standards by which the luxury hotel business is judged these days. Among the amenities it introduced are concierge service, twice-daily maid service, formal afternoon tea and full secretarial and translation services. The company also has emphasized fitness for its guests, both in health centers and in its menus that feature an `` alternative cuisine'' lower in calories, cholesterol and sodium. In testament to its efforts, Four Seasons hotels claimed more `` Five Diamond'' ratings from the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> this year than any of its competitors. <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> recalled fondly the origins of his business at the outset of the 1960s with a small <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> motel. Although he studied architecture, he was working in construction and built a 14-room motel for a client. `` It sparked an interest, I guess, in the idea,'' said <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>, in shirt sleeves. `` The idea comes quickly ... yet something finally concrete took six, seven years. `` You never anticipate that it's going to take you that long.'' His first hotel opened in 1961 in what was then a somewhat marginal downtown neighborhood, so he designed it to look inward and create a comfortable interior environment. `` My idea was that it had to be something distinctive,'' he said. `` The idea of it married the motel feel with hotel services.'' <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> said the basic principles remain the same today. `` Each step along the way carried with it that same idea, of giving the customer something that was special,'' he said. Sharp's office, flooded with natural light, is a stunning example of his ability to combine comfort and style. Although the office is sparsely furnished, each piece makes an impact from the large, red and blue Oriental rug to his imposing desk. He took obvious pride in showing off the entire headquarters building, located in a renovated printing shop down the street from the chain's modern Inn on the Park. As Four Seasons grew, <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> said he realized that it was acquiring a motley collection, everything from his first motel to a giant convention property since divested. `` It was n't until 1972 that I decided to concentrate on one end of the market totally, and to make sure that all the hotels would be consistent,'' he said. Decisions since then have been made carefully. <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> said, for example, that Four Seasons spent 10 years looking at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> before entering the market there with the <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> on Fifth Avenue. `` You make a list of all the cities that you consider primary destinations of the business traveler,'' he said. `` I guess what I was able to do was not just grab and take everything.'' He said expansion also has been cautious so that retreat is possible if problems crop up. `` We'll take it slowly,'' he said. `` We're not going to do more if it jeopardizes the existing operation.'' His goal for the next five years is to open at least two hotels annually. `` Where we'll go over time is the world _ literally,'' he said. Four Seasons is moving slowly into resorts. Its <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION> resort is scheduled to open late next year, and <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> said he believes about a half dozen are possible in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The company also is entering the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, in partnership with a Japanese company, and the first Four Seasons hotel should open in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> in 1991. `` There's nothing driving Four Seasons other than to do the right thing for the company,'' <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> said. Industry analysts say Four Seasons is well-positioned, generally enjoying the highest occupancy rates in its cities and often charging the highest rates as well. <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> said the chain's yield factor, or occupancy rate multiplied by room rate, is `` substantially more'' than the competition. `` As a company we are the largest operator of luxury hotels in the world,'' he said. `` There is n't another company that is as obsessed with customer satisfaction and consistency. ... We sell what we can guarantee we can do all the time.'' The corporation announced earnings of $ 5.3 million for the first six months of this year, up 14.6 percent from $ 4.6 million in the first half of 1987.

 <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Haid </PERSON>'s longtime hobby of doing accents came in handy when he was cast as an Australian soldier in the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> miniseries `` The Great Escape: Return With a Vengeance.'' He plays Sgt. <PERSON> Mac </PERSON> <PERSON> MacKenzie </PERSON> in the four-hour, two-part series that is a sequel to the blockbuster 1963 movie about the true story of a huge escape of Allied airmen from a German prisoner-of-war camp in World War II. `` He's a combination of a couple of guys,'' said <PERSON> Haid </PERSON>. `` Mostly a Scot, who's still alive but was conveniently changed to an Aussie for television. My character was a tunnel digger. Moles, they called them. `` We filmed in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> with a lot of British actors. My biggest challenge was fitting in with their dialects. My hobby is doing accents. I've been fascinated by accents since I was a kid. I have a kind of parrot ear. Mostly what I did was listen to tapes.

 Worries about a continuing oversupply of oil following another failed <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> meeting could further erode prices this week, analysts say. The December contract for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate, the benchmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, tumbled $ 1.20 a barrel on Monday, finishing the day at $ 13.17 per barrel on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. On Friday, the near-term contract had finished at $ 14.37 per barrel, off 7 cents for the week. The sharp drop in crude oil dragged down the prices of refined products as well. The November contract for unleaded gasoline dropped 1.26 cents to finish at 49.96 cents a gallon, with other contract months down as much as 2 cents a gallon. The heating oil contract for November closed down 2.81 cents, to a settlement price of 39.90 cents a gallon, with other contract months also down sharply. Analysts said the crude price erosion reflected investor worries that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> would continue flooding world markets with oil, pushing prices down even further. Since April, prices have fallen more than 25 percent due to the growing oversupply of oil. Prices for the December crude contract opened almost 90 cents lower than Friday's close after ministers from eight Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries adjourned a weekend meeting without reaching common ground on production quotas. Oil brokers said investors had hoped this weekend's <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> meeting in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> would produce a new production accord that would reduce daily output by as much as 3 million barrels. Prices had firmed slightly last week in anticipation of a positive outcome. `` Expectations were so high that in fact an agreement would take place, that when it did n't take place the market sold off,'' said <PERSON> Nauman </PERSON> <PERSON> Barakat </PERSON>, vice president for energy investments with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The 13-nation cartel produces an estimated 22 million barrels of oil a day, exceeding its self-imposed ceiling by more than 3 million barrels. Observers said before the meeting that the ministers planned to set a daily ceiling of 17.4 million barrels. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is said to be the principal problem, refusing to abide by its 1.6 million barrel-a-day quota since 1986. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is producing approximately 2.7 million barrels a day, arguing that it needs the oil revenue to rebuild its shattered economy after its eight-year war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The two countries began a cease-fire in August. Analysts say other quota violators fear that if they roll back their own production, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> will take over their market share. Recently, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, the largest <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> producer and the world's largest exporter, began exceeding its 4.3 million-barrel quota, reportedly to punish the other quota violators. But analysts say <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s failure to reach any kind of a resolution this weekend suggested the cartel is far from reinstituting discipline among its members. `` The fact that the meeting ended without a firm resolution confirmed the existing fundamentals _ that there is too much oil on world markets and prices have to go lower,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Steel </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> ministers plan two more meetings in November, including a full ministerial gathering on Nov. 21 in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>

 The fevered pitch of Wall Street's bidding for giant food companies could go even higher following <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s record $ 20.28 billion offer for <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION>' announcement Monday of a $ 90-a-share leveraged buyout offer for <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> came four days after <PERSON> Nabisco </PERSON>'s management said it might offer $ 17 billion, or $ 75 a share, to buy the company from `` Our offer is a better one,'' stated <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON>, a partner in the New York-based investment firm. Securities analysts said the <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> offer was more in line with <PERSON> Nabisco </PERSON>'s worth than the proposal presented by management, and say higher offers still may emerge. `` There's a possibility this will be the final bid, but it could go as high as $ 100,'' said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harriman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` It's feasible, but not at all certain.'' New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> said it would offer $ 90 a share in cash for about 87 percent of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION>'s 225.3 million outstanding shares, and would exchange securities valued at the same amount for the rest of the company's stock. The offer was was conditioned on support from <PERSON> Nabisco </PERSON>'s board. The investment firm, known for its big, successful leveraged buyout bids, said it would begin the tender offer formally later this week. At more than $ 20 billion, the offer would surpass the biggest corporate acquisition of any type, the $ 13.4 billion purchase of <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in 1984. There was no comment from <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> or the managers who on Thursday announced they were considering a $ 75-a-share cash bid for the food and tobacco company. On Wall Street, investors reacted enthusastically to <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION>'s offer. <PERSON> Nabisco </PERSON> stock shot up $ 7.25 a share to $ 84 in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite trading. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrow </PERSON>, who tracks <PERSON> Nabisco </PERSON> for the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said he doubted the management group, led by <PERSON> Nabisco </PERSON> <PERSON> President </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, would be disturbed by the <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> bid. `` They were definitely inviting offers,'' he said. <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said of the <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> group, `` They're in a no-lose situation. `` I think if they could buy at $ 75, they would have been happy,'' <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON> said, but also said `` they would be very happy if someone else bid a higher price.'' <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> had been expected to enter the whirlwind of bids for food companies that began Oct. 4 with a $ 5.23 billion bid for <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, a British company. But many thought the investment firm was considering a bid for <ORGANIZATION> Kraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which late Sunday rejected a more than $ 11 billion bid from <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and announced its own $ 13.59 billion recapitalization plan A successful buyout of <PERSON> Nabisco </PERSON> would be the biggest leveraged buyout of an American corporation by far. The largest LBO was <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION>' $ 6.1 billion buyout of <ORGANIZATION> Beatrice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION> in 1986. In a leveraged buyout, a company is acquired mainly with borrowed funds that are repaid either with company revenue or money raised by selling parts of the operation. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON>, a partner in the investment firm, said in a statement his company had raised an equity pool of $ 5.6 billion for buyouts. Experts say that amount could be used to `` leverage'' as much as $ 40 billion in loans for acquisitions. <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> also is leading a group attempting to acquire the publishing giant <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 2.5 billion. British publisher <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, who also seeks to buy <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON>, is fighting that bid in a <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> court. The investment firm recently withdrew a $ 5.03 billion bid for supermarket operator <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> after <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>'s board rejected the offer in favor of a financial restructuring. Past <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> leveraged buyouts also include the 1986 purchase of <ORGANIZATION> Safeway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 4.2 billion, the 1987 buyout of <ORGANIZATION> Owens-Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 3.7 billion, the purchase of <ORGANIZATION> Storer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 2.5 billion in 1985, and the buyout of <ORGANIZATION> Stop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year for $ 1.23 billion.

 Industry analysts see <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s move to lay off about 1,000 people while aggressively pursuing multibillion-dollar takeover deals as reflecting profound changes on post-crash Wall Street and signaling a new wave of cutbacks because of the depressed outlook for stocks. `` This is the beginning of the second round,'' said <PERSON> Perrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, who follows the business for <ORGANIZATION> Lipper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Analytical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. He estimated the number of securities industry layoffs nationwide, which reached more than 15,000 in the months following the October 1987 crash, could hit 25,000 by the end of this year, or about 9.6 percent of the total 260,000. Worried about a continued slump in stock trading, <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> laid off about 200 people earlier this month and expects the total to reach 1,000 by year's end, officials of the brokerage said Monday. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> already has accounted for about one-third of crash-related layoffs, largely because of its acquisition of the distressed <ORGANIZATION> E.F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> late last year for nearly $ 1 billion. But the company last week hinted at further reductions in its staff of 42,000 employees, when it reported an 85 percent tumble in its third-quarter profit. Shearson officials said the latest round of layoffs would affect all operations, but it was clear that retail brokerage would be affected most. Analysts said that side of the business requires a lot more support staff, such as computer operators and billing clerks, than other areas. On the other hand, financing takeover deals, the most frenzied part of the investment business, requires relatively few people and is the most profitable. `` What you've got here is a one-legged man,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanbury </PERSON>, who follows the industry for <ORGANIZATION> Wertheim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schroder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment firm. `` M & amp; A is red hot, while most other lines of business are the opposite.'' <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>, the second biggest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> brokerage behind <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, has become an aggressive financier of corporate takeovers and restructurings. It is adviser to management of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which surprised Wall Street last week by announcing it might try to buy the food-tobacco conglomerate for $ 17 billion in a leveraged buyout. Shearson would reap staggering profits if the management buyout succeeded, although the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> entered the fray Monday with a $ 20.28 billion bid. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> also has played key roles in other huge takeover deals over the past year. It represented <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in a $ 5.1 billion takeover of <ORGANIZATION> Sterling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>; it advised <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION>, target of an intense bidding war won by Canadian developer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Campeau </PERSON>, who paid $ 6.58 billion; and it helped takeover strategest <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON> buy <ORGANIZATION> Singer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 1 billion. Figures compiled by <ORGANIZATION> IDD </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, an investment industry research and publishing concern in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, show <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> ranked first during the first half of this year in number of takeover deals, at 105. <ORGANIZATION> IDD </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> ranked fourth in terms of the dollar value of these deals at $ 41.95 billion, behind <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> at $ 44.94 billion, <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> at $ 45.42 billion and <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> at $ 54.92 billion. `` Shearson's like any of us, we take advantage of our opportunities,'' said Long. `` The LBO game and M & amp; A business have been going at a furious pace, and as a consequence, the firm's attention is being diverted to areas where it can make money. Some Wall Street professionals noted the irony that <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>, which used a major post-crash advertising blitz to urge a long-term investment strategy, was diverting its own resources to speculative deal-making. Others called <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>'s strategy a necessary adjustment for long-term survival. `` It's like <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> cutting back on Caddies during a downturn and hiring people in the <ORGANIZATION> Chevrolet </ORGANIZATION> division,'' said Long.

While the price the Newton-based company plans to pay for <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> is seen by some as a bit high, the takeover will give it entry into European markets while helping insulate it from any unwanted takeover. `` The fit is excellent, although the price is a bit high,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassenberg </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Jenrette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Maytag </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it would launch a cash tender offer of $ 60 a share for up to 6.4 million shares, or about 49 percent of the outstanding shares, of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. The remaining <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> shares will be converted into an equivalent amount of <ORGANIZATION> Maytag </ORGANIZATION> stock. The companies said the tender offer and the merger together are valued at about $ 1 billion. The combined sales of both companies would exceed $ 3 billion. <PERSON> Hassenberg </PERSON> predicted that the buyout would erode <ORGANIZATION> Maytag </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings by as much as 25 cents a share next year but said the company would regain that ground in 1990 He said <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> has an `` outstanding position'' in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Maytag </ORGANIZATION> should be able to use that reputation to introduce its own line of major appliances. `` Through <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>'s Hoover division, we will become a leader in the international major appliance market,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Maytag </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Krumm </PERSON> in a prepared statement. He said the acquisition was a milestone for <ORGANIZATION> Maytag </ORGANIZATION> because it `` provides increased opportunities for our shareowners and helps us achieve our long-term strategy of becoming a global leader in the major appliance field.'' <ORGANIZATION> Maytag </ORGANIZATION> shares finished down $ 2.75 at $ 23.75 a share Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> shares zoomed up $ 13.25 to $ 56.62 -LCB- a share. The board of directors of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, including <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> Crown </PERSON> whose family is the company's largest shareholder with 15 percent, has approved the transaction, a news release from the companies said. Crown intends to exchange his family's stock and convertible bond holdings to <ORGANIZATION> Maytag </ORGANIZATION> stock, the release said. While investors drove <ORGANIZATION> Maytag </ORGANIZATION>'s value down at the news of the deal, several analysts praised the combination as a long-term plus for the company. Other analysts said the deal signals that <ORGANIZATION> Maytag </ORGANIZATION> intends to fight off any takeover bids. `` For investors looking for a <ORGANIZATION> Maytag </ORGANIZATION> takeover, it was n't very positive news,'' said <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>, an analyst for the <ORGANIZATION> Provident </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION>. `` But that's OK with me. <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> is a quality asset, with the most interesting thing coming from their position internationally. `` This wo n't put them -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Maytag </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- in the league with <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>, but it was the most they could do. It's a very positive move,'' said <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>. Another analyst, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballessa </PERSON> of the D.A. <ORGANIZATION> Davidson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Maytag </ORGANIZATION> was hoping to make itself less attractive as a takeover prospect. `` I know the company has anti-takeover provisions in its bylaws, but they may have wanted to add a wart to make themselves less attractive to a suitor. It's possible this is a wart. I do n't understand the logic,'' he said <ORGANIZATION> Maytag </ORGANIZATION>'s prime appliance brands are Admiral, <PERSON> Hardwick </PERSON>, Jenn-Air, <ORGANIZATION> Magic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chef </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Norge </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Maytag </ORGANIZATION>. It also makes vending machines. In addition to <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> has several lines of furniture, including <PERSON> Kittinger </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION>, <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON>, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> and Gunlocke. <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> has 13 production facilities in eight countries to manufacture and distribute washers, dryers, refrigerators, dishwashers and microwave ovens in addition to the floor care line. It does not market the major appliances in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Statesm </LOCATION>, and gets about 65 percent of its revenue overseas. <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> is the successor of the <ORGANIZATION> Rock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION>, which emerged from bankruptcy proceedings in 1984.

 The sale of <ORGANIZATION> Resorts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to <PERSON> Merv </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> could conclude within the week, according to the multimillionaire businessman and entertainer. Also on Monday, <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> announced he had hired the president of rival <PERSON> Harrah </PERSON>'s Marina Hotel and Casino to run Resorts. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> said he expects to complete the purchase of the gaming and real estate company from developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> on or around Nov. 3. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> will acquire Resorts International's casinos in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, and will sell Resorts' unfinished Taj Majal casino project in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> back to <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>. This week, <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> is visiting several cities around the country to raise investor interest in a $ 325 million bond issue needed to finance his purchase of Resorts. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said Monday that the financing `` really is the only obstacle to closing the deal.'' But <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> attorney representing <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, said the only roadblocks were final approval from <LOCATION> Bahamian </LOCATION> gaming regulators and `` a lot of documentation on the actual closing ...'' <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has granted <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> interim authorization to own and operate Resorts International's <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> gaming hall until he can get a plenary license The commission also approved <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>'s plans to split the company with <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> would be paid $ 63 million to break his lucrative management contract with the casino company. He then would pay <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> $ 273 million to buy back the Taj Mahal. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> will pay the Resorts Class A stockholders $ 36 a share _ or about $ 205 million. He will pay Trump $ 135 a share for his controlling block of Class B shares, which have 100 times the voting power of the Class A stock _ a total of $ 96 million. To run the new Resorts operation, <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> announced Monday he would hire <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON>, 43, has been president of <PERSON> Harrah </PERSON>'s East, a subsidiary of the <ORGANIZATION> Holiday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, for the past four years. Before that, he worked for <PERSON> Caesar </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. He could not be reached for comment Monday. <PERSON> Nina </PERSON> <PERSON> Andro </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>'s operations in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said Monday that <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON> `` has consistently been one of the top three operators in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Harrah </PERSON>'s has been called the most successful bottom-line operation on the East Coast.'' The future of I.G. `` Jack'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, Resorts International's current president, `` will be discussed with <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> over the next few days,'' <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> has been president of Resorts since 1960 and has a multiyear contract with the company for $ 1 million annually. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said that once the Resorts deal is complete, construction will resume on the Taj Mahal and the 1,250-room complex could open 14 or 15 months later, indicating a March 1990 grand opening.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The head of <ORGANIZATION> Farley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> says his company's $ 1.41 billion takeover bid for textile giant <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Point-Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is generous but industry analysts says a buyout probably will be more expensive than that. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, the Chicago-based parent of Fruit of the <ORGANIZATION> Loom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and one of the nation's largest privately owned conglomerates, said it would pay $ 48 a share in cash for each of <ORGANIZATION> Pepperell </ORGANIZATION>'s 29.4 million outstanding shares. `` It's -LRB- <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> -RRB- worth more,'' said <PERSON> Grace </PERSON> <PERSON> Taferner </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` I think it should be about $ 55 per share.'' <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Raymond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, also termed $ 55 a share as `` a good number,'' but added `` I do n't think you make your best bid first.'' In trading Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> rose $ 4.75 a share to $ 50, indicating speculators expected a higher offer to be made. <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> advised its stockholders not to take any action on the bid until the board of directors reviewed <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>'s bid and made a recommendation, said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Downs </PERSON>, a company spokesman. He said the board would meet by Nov. 4. `` We think it's an attractive offer to the shareholders for sure,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, who heads <ORGANIZATION> Farley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, in an interview Monday after announcing the offer. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> said in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> Chairman and Chief Executive Officer <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lanier </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> that he hoped to `` move forward on a constructive, friendly basis.'' The offer was not entirely unexpected. In May, <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> sought government permission to acquire up to 25 percent of <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>'s stock So far, <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> has spent $ 88 million for a 9.8 percent stake in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, Ga.-based company. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> said <PERSON> Lanier </PERSON> had telephoned him months ago `` and indicated he preferred to remain independent.'' <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>, which manufactures Arrow shirts and Martex towels, acquired textile rival <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stevens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year for $ 1.2 billion and then split up <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' assets with a rival suitor. <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> was left with most of <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' linen and towel operations, giving the company about 25 percent of the nation's home fashion textile market In a filing with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> has said that, if successful in its bid, it plans to sell <ORGANIZATION> Pepperell </ORGANIZATION>'s apparel fabrics and industrial fabrics businesses and keep the household fabrics business. `` The breakup value is worth more than keeping the company together,'' Ms. <PERSON> Taferner </PERSON> said. `` He's -LRB- <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> -RRB- said he wants the bed and bath business which is the jewel of the company. There are a lot of buyers for the businesses that he does n't want. He should be able to sell them off fairly easily.'' <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> already has taken legal action to challenge <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s anti-takeover statutes as well as <ORGANIZATION> Pepperell </ORGANIZATION>'s poison pill takever defense, which was strengthened last June in an effort to make unwanted takeovers prohibitively expensive The lawsuits would be dropped if <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> agrees to work with <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> on a friendly basis, <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> has $ 300 million earmarked for acquisitions, accumulated from a bond issue earlier this year, but has indicated he wants to keep two-thirds of it in reserve for other investments. In addition to Fruit of the Loom, the nation's largest underwear company, <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> operates <ORGANIZATION> Acme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boot </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Doehler-Jarvis </ORGANIZATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> ITT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> faces a maximum $ 500,000 fine for pleading guilty to wining and dining <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officials in order to obtain secret government information used to bid on $ 180 million in military contracts. The New York-based conglomerate pleaded guilty Monday in federal court to a charge of conspiring to defraud the government. The company admitted that an employee of its defense technology division in 1984 and early 1985 spent about $ 15,000 and was reimbursed for illegal gifts _ including liquor, sports and theater tickets, meals and golf games _ to <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officials at <ORGANIZATION> Hanscom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION>. In exchange, <ORGANIZATION> ITT </ORGANIZATION> received copies of internal government documents with confidential procurement information on two <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> programs <ORGANIZATION> ITT </ORGANIZATION> was interested in pursuing. <ORGANIZATION> ITT </ORGANIZATION> was indicted in June 1987, several months before a separate federal investigation into the use of consultants by corporations to get information for use in bidding for contracts. <ORGANIZATION> ITT </ORGANIZATION> officials said the case was not tied to that investigation. `` This office will continue to ferret out and prosecute vigorously fraud and corruption in the defense industry,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> said in a statement. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vicenzi </PERSON>, a senior marketing representative of <ORGANIZATION> ITT </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Nuys </PERSON>, Calif.-based <PERSON> Gilfillan </PERSON> subsidiary, which specializes in radar technology, pleaded guilty in July to the same charge He faces up to 35 years in prison and a $ 500,000 fine on the charges. `` We pleaded guilty to the fact that the person involved was our employee when he acted improperly,'' <ORGANIZATION> ITT </ORGANIZATION> Chairman Rand <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Araskog </PERSON> said in a statement. `` We had no choice because that employee pleaded guilty.'' According to the indictment in the case, <PERSON> Vicenzi </PERSON> was hired in August 1983 to pursue two <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> contracts _ an anti-radiation missile decoy system valued at more than $ 80 million and a mobile air traffic control radar system worth between $ 100 million and $ 150 million. <PERSON> Vicenzi </PERSON>'s $ 60,000-a-year job was to get inside government information on the programs, including <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> plans, specifications, procurement strategy and projected costs, the indictment said. He reportedly had close ties with procurement officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s Electronics Systems Division at <ORGANIZATION> Hanscom </ORGANIZATION>, which is responsible for buying all of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s electronics systems. Four government employees who received gratuities from <PERSON> Vincenzi </PERSON> gave him copies of documents with information on the contracts as well as general planning and funding documents, including the entire minutes of an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> meeting for the missile decoy system, the indictment said. He then sent the documents to other <ORGANIZATION> ITT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gilfillan </ORGANIZATION> employees, including senior business development officials, engineers and program managers, writing `` This is extremely sensitive'' or `` Do not acknowledge our possession of this document.'' <ORGANIZATION> ITT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gilfillan </ORGANIZATION> won a preliminary $ 6.4 million development contract for the $ 80 million missile decoy system, which would have protected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> radar sites by luring homing missiles away from a radar installation, the indictment said. Neither that system nor the radar control system, known as MPN-XX, was ever built. Federal prosecutors told the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> that several <ORGANIZATION> ITT </ORGANIZATION> employees tried to hide <PERSON> Vicenzi </PERSON>'s activities by destroying or concealing the documents after word was out of an investigation. <ORGANIZATION> ITT </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Vicenzi </PERSON> was fired in 1986 in an unrelated matter. <PERSON> Vicenzi </PERSON> allegedly had repeated contact with <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Raciti </PERSON>, a deputy program manager in logistics at <ORGANIZATION> Hanscom </ORGANIZATION> who resigned from the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in late 1986 after <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> oficials suspended him pending the outcome of the federal investigation. <PERSON> Raciti </PERSON> has not been charged. The indictment said <PERSON> Vicenzi </PERSON> on numerous occasions met with <PERSON> Raciti </PERSON> and `` bought him lunches, paid for him to play golf, provided him with tickets to sporting and theater events and gave him gifts of liquor.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> suspended its business with <ORGANIZATION> ITT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gillifan </ORGANIZATION> from July to November 1987 because of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> investigation.

 A surge in trading of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> stock options during the two days before the announcement of a $ 17 billion management buyout plan has prompted an investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Options </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The probe was launched last week after <ORGANIZATION> CBOE </ORGANIZATION> officials noticed a sharp rise in the number of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> stock options traded last Tuesday and Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> CBOE </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Moulds </PERSON> said Monday. <PERSON> Moulds </PERSON> said exchange officials monitor trading through computerized systems, `` and when it breaks usual trading patterns, that usually sets in motion an inquiry into the reasons why.'' A stock option contract is a right to buy or sell 100 shares of a certain stock at a specified price within a given time period. The value of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> stock options increased during the two days prior to the company's announcement. In September, only 1,039 contracts of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> options were traded daily, <PERSON> Moulds </PERSON> said. Last Tuesday, 4,079 contracts were traded; on Wednesday, the day preceding the announcement, 7,050 contracts were traded. After the buyout proposal was made public on Thursday, 25,850 <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> options traded on the <ORGANIZATION> CBOE </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Moulds </PERSON> said. After such an announcement, a large increase in trading volume is normal because the buyout plans often include a large payout to shareholders that can boost the value of the company's stock. But increased trading volume prior to the announcement can indicate that someone with advance knowledge of the company's plans was attempting to profit illegally. In a new development Monday, the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said it would begin a $ 20.28 billion tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION>. The latest <ORGANIZATION> CBOE </ORGANIZATION> inquiry follows a <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> investigation into options trading shortly before <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> announced a $ 5.2 billion dollar bid for <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> earlier this month.

 The dollar inched up against the Japanese yen today, while share prices rebounded moderately on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The dollar closed at 126.87 yen, 0.27 yen higher than Monday's close of 126.60 yen Opening at 127.08 yen, the currency moved slightly lower while ranging mainly betweeen 126.77 yen and 127.20 yen. The dollar-yen rate moved little because there was no news to stimulate it, said a dealer with <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. The dollar rose in early trading but `` it fell back as the market players started selling the currency when it moved up into the 127-yen level,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The 225-issue <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION>, which lost 57.03 points Monday, regained 139.95 points, or 0.51 percent, to close at 27,421.49. The index gained 10.48 points shortly after the market opened and continued upward. Trading was active with volume on the first section estimated at 1.2 billion shares. Steels, gas and real estate stocks attracted traders. Despite prospects for lower interest rates and declining oil prices, negative factors including Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s monthlong illness have kept share prices from rising dramatically.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar rose against all major currencies in early European trading today. Gold prices also were higher. Currency dealers said the dollar's rise was mostly a reaction to its fall last week and also followed renewed signals from the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> that it is ready to buy dollars if the currency declines further. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar edged up 0.27 yen to a closing 126.87 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 127.10 yen. Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Monday's rates, included: 1.7965 West German marks, up from 1.7860; 1.5235 Swiss francs, up from 1.5145; 6.1350 French francs, up from 6.1025; 2.0235 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0143; 1,338.35 Italian lire, up from 1,330.85; and 1.2002 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1973 In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar also rose against the British pound, which cost $ 1.7485 in early trading, cheaper than $ 1.7520 late Monday. Gold rose after falling several dollars on Monday, hurt by the failure of eight key members of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> to agree on production restrictions. Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 406 a troy ounce, up from $ 405.15 bid late Monday. At midmorning today, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $ 406.60. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the bid price was $ 406.40, up from $ 405.50 bid late Monday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold rose 32 cents to close at a bid $ 408.52.

 Soviet Ambassador <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON> met poultry magnate <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Perdue </PERSON> and walked away with two `` Oven Stuffer Roasters'' and some insight into chicken processing. <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON> on Monday took a daylong tour of Perdue Farms on the Eastern Shore to get a firsthand look at the mechanics of poultry processing. As chairman and chief owner of <ORGANIZATION> Perdue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON>'s 68-year-old host oversees a chicken empire that's expected to gross more than $ 1 billion in sales this year <PERSON> Perdue </PERSON>'s face is familiar on television where he appears in his own commercials. `` It's something that's very well developed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and with <PERSON> Perdue </PERSON> especially,'' <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON> said of American poultry production. `` The problem in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is output quality and quantity.'' <PERSON> Perdue </PERSON> accompanied the ambassador and his entourage of eight including <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Liana </PERSON>, and two daughters through a hatchery in <LOCATION> Westover </LOCATION>, and a processing plant in <LOCATION> Accomac </LOCATION> that employs 1,700 people and slaughters an average 300,000 chickens a day. Afterward, he presented the diplomat with an ice chest bearing the <PERSON> Perdue </PERSON> logo that contained the two roasting chickens. The rest of the Soviet delegation from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> received similar freebies. <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON> said the visit was his first contact with chicken processing in any country. He called his trip a demonstration that `` diplomacy is not just politics, it's economic relations ... technological relations.'' The ambassador said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would like to increase chicken production. Watching eviscerated poultry moving swiftly through the production line, is `` an interesting experience for me,'' he told reporters. As for <PERSON> Perdue </PERSON>'s television commercials, <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON> said he has seen them and found them amusing. But he added that he is less concerned with the marketing aspects of poultry production and more concerned about output. <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON> said there is potential for some joint enterprise with <PERSON> Perdue </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but `` we will have a better idea'' about that after <PERSON> Perdue </PERSON> makes a planned visit to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Perdue </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Whaley </PERSON> confirmed that <PERSON> Perdue </PERSON> is scheduled to make a visit soon, but she declined to speculate on what business dealings might be under discussion.

 A former tax shelter promoter who is in federal prison has been sentenced to seven to 21 years in state prison after pleading guilty to charges of bilking investors of more than $ 150 million. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Galanis </PERSON>, 45, of <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, pleaded guilty Friday to four larceny counts of a 105-count <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> grand jury indictment.

<HEAD>British, U.S. Actions Set Back Minorco Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The British government and a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> federal judge have dealt damaging blows to <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION>'s hostile bid for <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fields </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, citing concerns about monopolization of the world gold market. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> today, the government said the takeover offer, which values Gold Fields at roughly $ 5 billion, would be investigated by the <ORGANIZATION> Monopolies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mergers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> for its possible adverse effect on competition. The ruling blocks for up to three months the bid by the Luxembourg-based investment arm of the South African gold and diamond mining giants, <ORGANIZATION> Anglo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> De </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>. On Monday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mukasey </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> issued a temporary injunction against the bid on antitrust grounds Gold Fields has contended that a takeover by <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> would imperil American access to gold and strategic minerals. <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> offered $ 22.86 in cash and stock for each <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fields </ORGANIZATION> share it does not already own on condition the bid was not referred to the British monopolies commission. <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> has lifted its stake in <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fields </ORGANIZATION> to about 29.6 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement saying it was considering its position in the light of the British government's decision. Trade Secretary Lord <PERSON> Young </PERSON> asked the monopolies commission to report to him within the three months. The British investigation will center on the proposed takeover's impact on strategic metals, in particular titanium and zircon, a spokesman at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> said Titanium, a metal largely used as a whitener in paints, also is used in jet engines, a Consolidated Gold Fields metallurgist said. <PERSON> Zircon </PERSON> is mainly used as a refracting agent in glass and steel furnaces, but is also a critical substance in nuclear submarines and power plants, and in rocket nose cones, he said. Consolidated Gold Fields says that Australian-based <ORGANIZATION> Renison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Goldfields </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, in which it has a 49 percent stake, is the world's largest producer of mineral sands that serve as raw materials for titanium and zircon.

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Financially drained <ORGANIZATION> Fruehauf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is restructuring its slumping trailer operations, a move that will necessitate an unspecified number of layoffs and early retirements at its headquarters here, the company announced. The truck-trailer and auto-parts maker began layoffs last week in its engineering department, <ORGANIZATION> Fruehauf </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hladik </PERSON> said Monday. About 40 percent of the department's 78 engineers received pink slips, and others will be transferred, he added. `` There will be some layoffs in personnel and an early retirement program has been implemented,'' <PERSON> Hladik </PERSON> said. Low profit margins and hot competition have depressed Fruehauf's trailer division, which lost $ 29 million in 1986 and broke even last year The company has been struggling since a management-led leveraged buyout in 1986 left it saddled with debt. Fruehauf has sold a number of operations and trimmed its long-term debt to $ 705 million, down from $ 1.6 billion in 1986. Last week, the company in part blamed that debt for third-quarter losses of $ 19.1 million. That compares to a loss of $ 14.3 million or $ 1.77 per share in the third quarter of 1987. The company is discussing a possible merger with farm and industrial machinery manufacturer <ORGANIZATION> Varity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Locked-out IP Workers Go To The Polls Friday To Vote On Compromise
Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOBILE, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Locked-out union workers go to the polls Friday to decide whether to accept a compromise offer aimed at breaking their 1 -LCB- - year-old labor dispute with <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION> The offer covers a six-year period retroactive to Feb. 1, 1987. The previous contract expired in January 1987 and union workers were locked out of the plant on March 21, 1987. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Langham </PERSON>, regional vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paperworkers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, said the proposed contract `` provides tremendous shift differential improvement and it provides that all union members would be returned to work immediately.'' One of the major issues in the labor dispute has been IP's policy of paying production employees extra when they work Sundays and holidays The company wanted to eliminate the bonuses to cut costs. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Bragg </PERSON>, president of UPIU Local 265 and a member of the committee that has represented the 1,200 locked-out workers at the bargaining table, said the company would not address the bonus issue. <PERSON> Bragg </PERSON> said the union membership appears to be `` split at this point as to who wants to fight and who wants to quit.'' `` We commend our people for fighting the battle as long as they have,'' he said. `` But at some point in time, we had to go back to the members for direction on which way they want us to go.'' Company officials have said the locked-out workers can not return to their jobs until they accept a new labor agreement. The Mobile mill has been operated by temporary workers since the start of the lockout, which spread to strikes at IP mills in three other states. Those strikes have all been called off.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Stock prices were narrowly mixed in light, nervous trading Tuesday. With few major incentives for trading, players largely were hanging back awaiting Thursday's release of British trade figures for September. `` There is a lot of nervousness over the pound, interest rates and the trade figures,'' said one dealer about the day's light level of trading activity. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index was unchanged at 1,848.4 at midday. Volume was thin, with just 214.9 million shares changing hands, compared with 289.5 million shares at the same time Monday. The major market-affecting news was a keenly awaited decision by the British government to refer <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION>'s 2.9 billion-pound, or $ 5.06 billion, bid for <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fields </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> Monopolies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mergers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to investigate its possible impact on competition.

 <PERSON> Scarlett </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Hara </PERSON>'s hometown is for sale, and cash-rich Japanese investors are the principal targets of businessmen marketing <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s highest profile office buildings. It is a poorly kept secret that a Japanese insurance company is about to buy the <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION>, paying $ 300 million for <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s year-old showpiece skyscraper And market professionals say other buildings, principally the headquarters tower of <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, hub for <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>'s broadcasting conglomerate, are on the block and may soon be sold to syndicates made up largely of foreign investors. The Asian invasion of the American real estate market has raised hackles elsewhere in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, as major landmarks like the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> building in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> have been snapped up by the Japanese. But here in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, the phenomenon follows years of active campaigning for foreign investment. <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> has been mining <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for business since the mid-70s and the state now ranks second to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in Japanese manufacturing investment. <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> ranks third among American cities behind <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> in the number of Asian-owned businesses per 1,000 Asian residents. `` Jobs. Jobs is the purpose of our efforts,'' said <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardoza </PERSON>, deputy commissioner of the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> and Trade. A decade of self-promotion and airport improvements by the city and state have helped fuel the drive for foreign investment, said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Judd </PERSON>, a business consultant who was one of the founders eight years ago of the <ORGANIZATION> Japan-America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. A survey on <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> real estate by the <ORGANIZATION> Braemar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> says 12.06 percent of the city's office space is foreign-owned, and <ORGANIZATION> Braemar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> owner and managing partner <PERSON> Tarby </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> predicts 50 percent of the best office space will be foreign-owned by the year 2000, with the Japanese accounting for half `` With all of the major Japanese banks currently in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and two airlines, <ORGANIZATION> JAL </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- and <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Air Lines -RRB-, now flying direct links to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Narita </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, I am confident that we will see more Japanese investors looking at our office buildings, hotels and regional malls for acquisition,'' he said. <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> `` is at the top of the second tier'' of cities drawing Japanese interest, <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> said, because its so-called `` trophy properties'' are available at cheaper rates than in the `` first-tier'' cities of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> D.C </ORGANIZATION>. There also is less competition in cities such as <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> to purchase trophy properties _ defined loosely by <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> as `` quality real estate, architecturally significant with a major tenant.'' The pending purchase of the IBM Tower by <ORGANIZATION> Sumitomo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` is the big foot in our pond,'' <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> said, and more such deals should follow fairly soon. Such deals have been aided by the recent strength of the Japanese yen over the dollar and by <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s expected strong growth in the next several years. The combination makes real estate investments particularly attractive. Among foreign investors, the Japanese have the most money and are the most aggressive, <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> said. In addition, he said, the Japanese feel pressure from their peers to invest in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The Consulate General of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> says there were 236 Japanese-owned facilities in the state as of July 1, employing 12,100 people and representing an investment of $ 810 million. A report last year by the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> said there were six Taiwanese-owned facilities and four owned by <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION>. Two investors were from <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and one from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. Of those Asian-owned businesses, 38 are headquarters for <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> subsidiaries, including <ORGANIZATION> Hitachi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, which makes telecommunications equipment; <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, athletic shoe manufacturer; <ORGANIZATION> Mizuno </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Golf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a division of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest sporting goods company; and <ORGANIZATION> TDK </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> -RRB- </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, manufacturer of video cassette tapes There are numerous regional headquarters, and manufacturing plants for some of the best-known Japanese products, including <ORGANIZATION> Maxell </ORGANIZATION> tapes, <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> records, <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> televisions and <PERSON> Kubota </PERSON> tractors. There are also nine Japanese banks, and <PERSON> Judd </PERSON> said a 10th is expected to open soon. In all, there were 1,057 foreign-owned facilities in the state last year, the Industry and Trade report said. The department said Japanese capital investment ranked second in the state behind <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Just last week, the <ORGANIZATION> Yamaha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> opened its <ORGANIZATION> Yamaha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> golf car factory at <LOCATION> Newnan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, its first North American manufacturing facility. Some of that investment may have been driven by fears the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would enact severely protectionist trade legislation. Despite passage of a watered-down trade bill, <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> said he does n't expect the flood of foreign investment to slow anytime soon.

 When <PERSON> Joon </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Song </PERSON> moved to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> 26 years ago, there were three Korean families in town. `` Then my brother came, and my sister, my father,'' <PERSON> Song </PERSON> said. Other families followed, and now, Song estimates, there are between 15,000 and 20,000 Koreans living in the metropolitan area of 2.5 million people. There are also an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 Chinese and about 5,000 Japanese, according to <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Judd </PERSON>, an independent business consultant who has spent much of the past two decades promoting <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> business connections in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. A recent study disclosed that many of those Asian-Americans own their own businesses _ so many that <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> ranked third in the country behind <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> in the number of Asian-owned businesses per 1,000 Asian residents. The study said there are 80.5 Asian-owned businesses per 1,000 Asian-Americans in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> was first with 90.3, followed by <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> at 84.9. Places with large Asian populations such as <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> were far down the list. The finding surprised Song, a past president of the <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, an umbrella organization of 72 Korean support groups in the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> metropolitan area. `` Just like the Irish went to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> -LRB- and -RRB- the Polish went to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, Koreans and Chinese came to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Judd </PERSON>, a founder of the <ORGANIZATION> Japan-America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Song estimates that about 70 percent of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s Asians are direct immigrants with the rest coming from other major <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> cities They are drawn, he said, by the same factors that have made <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and the rest of the Sunbelt some of the fastest growing areas in the country. `` Weather's good. Transportation's good. Lots of things -LRB- are -RRB- good,'' said Song, who works for <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in Oriental business development. The new arrivals also find a strong sense of community, 42 Korean churches, a Korean-American school and a Korean chamber of commerce. `` Most of the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> business is family business, that's why the business is growing very fast,'' Song said. The exact <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> population of the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> is hard to judge, with the latest figures coming from the 1980 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Census and most experts agreeing the numbers have changed substantially since then.

 <ORGANIZATION> Borden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday its third-quarter earnings rose 16.4 percent as its sales picked up 11.6 percent from the same period a year earlier. The food, consumer products and chemical company said it earned $ 91.9 million, or $ 1.24 a share, during the quarter ended Sept. 30, up from $ 79 million, or $ 1.07 a share, in third-quarter 1987. Sales for the latest period totaled $ 1.87 billion, up from $ 1.68 billion. <PERSON> Borden </PERSON> said disappointing results in its dairy division were more than offset by gains in the company's grocery, snacks and chemicals units. For the first nine months of the year, <ORGANIZATION> Borden </ORGANIZATION> reported earnings of $ 218 million, or $ 2.95 per share, up 17.1 percent from $ 185.7 million, or $ 2.52 a share, a year earlier.

 The stock market was little changed today as prices withstood profit-taking and takeover speculation. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was off .18 at 2,170.16 at midafternoon. Losers narrowly outpaced gainers by about 8 to 7 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 640 up, 730 down and 521 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 110.76 million shares as of 2 p.m. on Wall Street. Traders were encouraged that the market did not lose ground as it consolidated in the face of a two-month-old rally. `` The profit-taking has been well contained,'' one trader said. The market, however, has divided into two unequal segments _ one that involves takeover and buyout issues and another that involves the remaining equities untouched by real bids or speculation. Billion-dollar bids have been made recently for such big-name companies as <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point-Pepperell </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. Large bids tend to put the spotlight on the industries of target companies, fueling further speculation about a target company's peers as potential takeover candidates. `` Takeover speculation has reached a new extreme,'' said <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> A.G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. `` The crescendo keeps getting louder and louder.'' The rest of the market, however, is not awash with excitement. Analysts said the broad market appears tired and unable to mount a sustainable advance. A government report showing a 4.1 percent drop in durable goods orders in September was within market expectations. The report, which hinted that inflation is being held in check, coupled with stability in the bond and currency markets helped support stock prices, said <PERSON> Emmanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Geronimous </PERSON>, a senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>.

 The oil and steel giant <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported on Tuesday a 63 percent increase in its third-quarter profit and boosted its quarterly dividend by 17 percent. `` Given our strong cash position and our confidence in the sustainability of our profit, we are pleased to increase the return to our shareholders,'' Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, employee-owned <ORGANIZATION> Weirton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said its third-quarter earnings edged up slightly from a year ago, its 19th consecutive profitable quarter since employees bought the mill from <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intergroup </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION>, the Pittsburgh-based parent of Marathon Oil and the nation's largest steel producer, reported its quarterly profit rose to $ 228 million, or 80 cents per share, from $ 140 million, or 46 cents per share, a year Third-quarter sales rose 7.7 percent to $ 4.2 billion from $ 3.9 billion.

The 1987 third quarter benefited from a $ 47 million credit on restructuring charges and a pre-tax credit of $ 22 million from asset sales. The company boosted its dividend to 35 cents per share from 30 cents, payable Dec. 10 to stockholders of record at the end of business Nov. 4. <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 598 million, or $ 2.07 per share, on sales of $ 12.4 billion in the first nine months of the year. <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 233 million, or 67 cents per share, on sales of $ 10.6 billion in the 1987 period. Marathon reported quarterly operating income of $ 183 million on sales of $ 2.3 billion thanks to better margins on refined profits. `` Marathon is positioned to make a meaningful contribution to corporate results, even in a market characterized by low and volatile worldwide crude oil prices,'' <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday its third-quarter net income fell 16 percent, marking the third consecutive quarter of declining profits for the nation's largest retailer. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> blamed the drop on flat merchandise sales and intense competition from other retailers. The company said its net income totaled $ 344.2 million, or 90 cents per share, for the three months ending Sept. 30, compared with $ 409 million, or $ 1.08 per share, for the same period a year ago. Revenue for the 1988 third quarter rose 9.5 percent to $ 13.35 billion, compared with $ 12.19 billion last year. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' second-quarter net income was 5 percent below the year-earlier results, and its first-quarter profit was off by 37 percent. For the first three quarters combined, <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' net income was 18 percent below its net for the first nine months of 1987. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> has been struggling to improve its performance, which has been poor in comparison to other large retailers, and the company has been rumored to be considering selling some of its assets. The <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merchandise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, with responsibility for the company's store operations, reported third-quarter income of $ 135.4 million, compared with $ 170.4 million a year ago. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> said the group's results were adversely affected by flat sales, intense competition, pressure on gross margins and inventory adjustments. The merchandise group's results included a $ 26 million income-tax benefit resulting from a bookkeeping change. The <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> reported third-quarter income of $ 20.6 million compared with a loss of $ 4.2 million last year. The group includes Discover Card, <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' all-purpose credit card, which showed a profit for the third consecutive quarter after two years of losses. Discover Card reported income of $ 13.6 million compared with a loss of $ 29.4 million last year. The <ORGANIZATION> Allstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> had third-quarter income of $ 217 million, down from $ 240.5 million last year. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> said the decline was due to lower underwriting results, reduced tax benefits and lower capital gains. The <ORGANIZATION> Coldwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Real </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> reported third-quarter income of $ 25.8 million, compared with $ 47.8 million a year ago. Income in both quarters included the sale of shopping centers, <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> said, with the timing of the 1987 sales accounting for the larger income last year. For the nine months ending Sept. 30, <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> had net income of $ 893.1 million, or $ 2.35 per share, on sales of $ 38.49 billion compared with net income of $ 1.09 billion, or $ 2.86 per share, on sales of $ 34.39 billion in the first nine months of 1987.

 <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday said its third-quarter profits fell 65 percent from a year ago partly because of difficult business conditions in its domestic tire operations. For the quarter ended Sept. 30, <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 63.5 million, or $ 1.11 a share. A year earlier, the company reported net income of $ 178.7 million, or $ 3.13 a share.

Sales, however, rose 8 percent to $ 2.7 billion, from $ 2.5 billion a year ago. <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> attributed the recent decline in profits partly to higher natural rubber costs in its domestic tire operations. Plant efficiencies also were reduced due to an unusually hot summer, when the company was forced to cut back on electricity at some plants. <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> began a major cost-cutting effort and shed most of its non-rubber operations beginning in late 1986 to raise cash and fend off a hostile takeover attempt by financier Sir <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON>. Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercer </PERSON> said the company experienced a lag in recovering costs through price increases. Tire unit sales in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> replacement market were down in the three months, although the decline was partially offset by better unit sales of lower priced tires to original equipment manufacturers. The company indicated its businesses in 27 foreign countries showed improved earnings, but they were partially offset by greater foreign currency lossses. Through the nine months, <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> earned fell 51 percent to $ 293.7 million, or $ 5.13 a share, on sales of $ 8.1 billion. In the year-ago period, earnings were $ 603.9 million, or $ 9.78 a share, on sales of $ 7.4 billion.

 Wheat futures closed sharply lower Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in a late, technically motivated sell-off that spread from the wheat pit to the other grain and soybean markets. Corn and soybeans finished moderately lower; oat prices closed down sharply.

 The stock market was narrowly mixed in dull trading today as prices steadied in the face of profit-taking and takeover speculation. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 1.78 at 2,172.12 an hour before the closing bell. Losers narrowly outpaced gainers by about 9 to 8 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 653 up, 735 down and 546 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 128.75 million shares as of 3 p.m. on Wall Street. Traders were encouraged that the market did not lose ground as it consolidated in the face of a weeks-long rally. `` The profit-taking has been well contained,'' one dealer said. The market, however, has divided into two segments _ one that involves takeover and buyout issues and another that involves the remaining equities untouched by real bids or speculation. Billion-dollar bids have been made recently for such big-name companies as <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point-Pepperell </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. Large bids tend to put the spotlight on the industries of target companies, fueling further speculation about a target company's peers as potential takeover candidates. `` Takeover speculation has reached a new extreme,'' said <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> A.G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. `` The crescendo keeps getting louder and louder.'' The rest of the market, however, is not awash with excitement. Analysts said the broad market appears tired and unable to mount a sustainable advance. A government report showing a 4.1 percent drop in durable goods orders in September was within market expectations. The report, which hinted that inflation is being held in check, coupled with stability in the bond and currency markets helped support stock prices, said <PERSON> Emmanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Geronimous </PERSON>, a senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Among <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> takeover issues, <PERSON> Nabisco </PERSON> was up | at 84 |; <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> fell 3 -RRB- to 98 |, <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> was off -LRB- at 59 -LCB-, and <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Point-Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> was off 1 -LCB- at 48 Elsewhere, <ORGANIZATION> Rorer </ORGANIZATION> rose 3 -LRB- to 45 -LRB- amid speculation that <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hoffman-LaRoche </ORGANIZATION> might launch a $ 60-a-share takeover bid. <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> declined comment. Church's Fried Chicken was up -RCB- at 8. The company received an $ 8-a-share bid from Popeyes Fried Chicken. <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> plunged 9 -LCB- to 59 -RRB- following the release of lower-than-expected earnings for the third quarter. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks gained .02 to 158.87.

<HEAD>Control Data Reports First Loss After Four Profitable Quarters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> on Tuesday blamed market `` softness'' in key business sectors for causing the computer company to post a net loss in the third quarter, its first loss after four profitable quarters. Another computer company, <ORGANIZATION> Storage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said its profit fell 76 percent in the latest quarter. Data-storage devices for mainframe computers are Storage Technology's principal business and make up about one-third of the revenue of <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> said it had a net loss of $ 2.4 million on revenues of $ 841.4 million for the quarter ending Sept. 30. In the third quarter of 1987, <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> had net earnings of $ 6.8 million, or 16 cents per share, on revenues of $ 831.4 million. For the first nine months of 1988, <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> reported net earnings of $ 14.5 million, or 34 cents a share, on revenues of $ 2.7 billion, compared with earnings of $ 8.5 million, or 19 cents a share, on revenues of $ 2.4 billion over the same period last year. `` We are disappointed that <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION>'s 1988 results will come in below mid-year expectations,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> chairman and chief executive officer. `` Nevertheless, the company's recovery remains on track, and we continue to anticipate that <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION>'s operating performance in 1988 will be stronger than it was in 1987. Control Data's computer systems and services division has received expected revenues later than anticipated, a trend that is expected to continue into the fourth quarter, according to company spokeswoman <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Foltz </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> said its results were helped by applying tax benefits in the quarter worth $ 4.8 million. Third-quarter results also benefited from the sale of <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION>'s interest in <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Imprimis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the company's disk drive subsidiary, exceeded its third quarter 1987 performance and 1988 plan, even though results for the period just ended were below those reported in the first and second quarters of 1988, <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> said Storage Technology, of <LOCATION> Lousville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, which emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection last year, said its profit fell to $ 752,000, or less than 1 cent a share, from $ 3.2 million, or 1 cent a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $ 128.3 million from $ 107 million. For the first nine months of its fiscal year, <ORGANIZATION> Storage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> said its profit fell to $ 15.7 million, or 7 cents a share, from $ 20.4 million, or 9 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $ 372.9 million from $ 301 million.

<HEAD>Staggering Debt Loads in Takeover Craze Could Severely Affect
Workforce</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The intensifying pace of multibillion-dollar takeovers and restructurings that rely mainly on borrowed money could severely reshape the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> job market and leave thousands of people unemployed, labor economists and consultants said Tuesday. They argue that the staggering amounts of debt acquired by many companies as a result of these transactions, called leveraged buyouts or LBOs, will have to be repaid somehow, even if it means selling profitable assets, cutting payrolls and reducing benefits such as health-care insurance. Some LBO critics argue that the impact would multiply if the nation plunges into a recession, forcing these highly indebted companies to cut more deeply into the core of their businesses in order to meet debt payments. These warnings come at a time that many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies are aggressively cutting costs to survive in an increasingly competitive world economy and may not be able to afford added debt burdens. `` There is a casino society atmosphere in this country, because shareholders want to make a killing,'' said <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Schechter </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> economist in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` The end result is billions of debt. We've already had cases in which thousands of jobs are lost.'' As examples, he said, the $ 4.2 billion LBO of <ORGANIZATION> Safeway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> left thousands of workers unemployed in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> because property there was sold to pay off debt. A <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> restructuring to thwart a hostile takeover, which saddled the company with $ 3.6 billion in debt, led the company to close factories and lay off hundreds of employees. The frenzy of company restructurings that have altered the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic landscape this decade already had raised some of these issues. Many that have restructured into privately-held companies emerge as stronger because management is more focused on their core businesses and faces fewer pressures for short-term profit. Retailer <ORGANIZATION> R.H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, for example, which went private in a $ 3.6 billion LBO in 1985, is regarded as one of the best-managed chains in the industry. <ORGANIZATION> Seven-Up </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which languished under conglomerate owner <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>, increased productivity and trimmed waste after it was sold in an LBO two years ago. But the speed and size of deals announced just in the past few weeks, notably a proposed $ 20 billion LBO of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, have raised fears of upheavals in the workforce that had not been widely envisioned before. `` I do n't think this is good, frankly,'' said <PERSON> Edith </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON>, a partner in <LOCATION> Weiner </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Edrich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-based </LOCATION> business consulting firm that focuses on long-range trends. `` If one company does this to restructure and solve problems of non-productivity, that's one thing, but the evidence is that's not the case anymore,'' she said. `` It's gotten to the point where we're not talking about the long-term interests of the economy at all. Rising concern about the impact of LBOs also coincides with a labor force increasingly comprised of working couples, who want more job-related benefits for themselves and their children. Some economists say these are colliding trends that already have caused management-labor conflicts and signal a declining standard of living for a broad spectrum of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> wage-earners. `` The shift from equity to debt financing is having a major impact on workforces,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Belous </PERSON>, a senior economist at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a Washington-based research concern. `` You have to pay debt. If you have a balance sheet which is highly leveraged, you've lost financial flexibility,'' he said. `` How do you regain it? You march into head of human resources and regain flexibility that way.'' For example, he said, many companies are relying increasingly on part-time, temporary workers who receive less pay and little or no benefits. The relatively slow growth of wages in the past few years is a partial reflection of this trend, he said. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Miners </PERSON>, partner and chief operating officer at <ORGANIZATION> Goodrich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Sherwood </PERSON>, a human resources consulting firm in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said many LBO companies can not afford to give generous benefits-wage packages. `` They may offer insurance but employees must contribute,'' he said. `` When it comes time to give raises, they'll give less than the norm. They'll eliminate a lot of jobs to fine tune the machine they have.'' Although some companies will benefit with increased productivity, he said, longer-term consequences are unclear. Many employees could grow bitter and disloyal, resulting in declining productivity. `` Some of these companies, all they care about is the service of the debt,'' Miners said. `` The pride factor workers may have had in the past could disappear.''

 The dollar finished mixed against major foreign currencies Tuesday, weighed down by a government report of a slowdown in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factory orders. The dollar edged down against the British pound and the Japanese yen, but rose against the currencies of most other major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trading partners. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said orders for `` big-ticket'' durable goods plunged an unexpected 4.1 percent in September. Currency traders took the decline as a sign that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy could be slowing down, something that would tend to decrease demand for dollars by foreign investors. The factory orders report fit in with other signs of a slowdown last month, including the second consecutive decline in retail sales and a drop in manufacturing employment. The dollar's decline against the British pound was partly the result of a speech by <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Chancellor of the Exchequer, that supported sterling, according to <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Conte </PERSON>, a vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Barclays </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar edged up 0.27 Japanese yen to a closing 126.87 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it rose to 127.75 yen. At the end of the day in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar fell to 126.80 yen from 127.02.

<HEAD>USW Contract Major Obstacle, Wheeling-Pitt Chief Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WHEELING, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new contract with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steelworkers </ORGANIZATION> union is one of the major obstacles as <ORGANIZATION> Wheeling-Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> prepares to present its reorganization plan to federal bankruptcy court, company president and chief executive officer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Scharffenberger </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` Negotiating an equitable labor agreement is the single most important task still before us,'' <PERSON> Scharffenberger </PERSON> said during the company's annual shareholders' meeting. `` The next contract we sign with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steelworkers </ORGANIZATION> will, to a very large degree, determine whether <ORGANIZATION> Wheeling-Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> can compete in the global steel economy after we leave the shelter of bankruptcy.'' He said contract negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> USW </ORGANIZATION> must start soon, but probably not until November. The union's current contract expires 10 days after the company's reorganization plan is approved by the court, <PERSON> Scharffenberger </PERSON> said. But <ORGANIZATION> USW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> 23 Director <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> said following the meeting it would be foolish to start contract talks before the reorganization plan is complete. <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> said there's no sense `` wasting our time'' negotiating a contract when all claims against the company have n't been settled. He said it would be better to wait until the plan is filed and union knows just how much money the company has available to pay its workers. <PERSON> Scharffenberger </PERSON>, speaking at a news conference before the shareholders' meeting, said talks about the company's pension obligations are continuing with the <ORGANIZATION> USW </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Pension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benefit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guaranty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the federal agency that insures pensions. When <ORGANIZATION> Wheeling-Pitt </ORGANIZATION> filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April 1985, it terminated its pension plan, and the federal pension agency assumed responsibility for the benefits. <PERSON> Scharffenberger </PERSON> said the company also is negotiating with the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which has a $ 400 million claim against the company stemming from the pension problems. He said the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> has offered to accept $ 18 million to settle the dispute, while the company is offering $ 1.8 million. <PERSON> Scharffenberger </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> USW </ORGANIZATION> should n't expect too much in its contract talks. `` Our negotiations must be conducted in the light of what could be called optimistic realism,'' he said. <PERSON> Wheeling-Pitt </PERSON> will try to negotiate a 15 percent work force reduction over the next two years, mainly through attrition, <PERSON> Scharffenberger </PERSON> said. The company has 6,400 employees, 5,200 of who are covered by the <ORGANIZATION> USW </ORGANIZATION> contract. He said <PERSON> Wheeling-Pitt </PERSON> has about $ 414 million in cash on hand, but most will go to creditors immediately after the reorganization plan is confirmed. `` As terrible as bankruptcy is, and as expensive as it is ... it gave us a marvelous opportunity to clean up the company,'' <PERSON> Scharffenberger </PERSON> said at the news conference. `` But I do n't recommend it.''

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday announced plans to buy back shares with a current market value of more than $ 900 million, boosting its stock price as sketchy takeover rumors swirled. Analysts said a takeover bid for the computer company seemed quite unlikely and described the buyback as a step to take advantage of the stock's bargain price while doing something to benefit its shareholders. `` I do n't think it's a defensive move by any means,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Pompian </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> for <ORGANIZATION> Needham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION>'s stock rose $ 2 a share to $ 92 a share in consolidated <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading, following a rise of $ 3 a share on Monday. Digital, the world's second biggest computer company after <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said its board of directors had authorized management to buy back up to 10 million of its own shares from time to time on the open market. That number of shares represents about 8 percent of the common stock outstanding. They would be bought at whatever the prevailing market price is at the time. The recent spate of takeover activity involving companies such as <ORGANIZATION> Kraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> helped revive old rumors that <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> was interested in buying <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION>. Both companies have disparaged the rumors. `` Whoever would be buying <ORGANIZATION> DEC </ORGANIZATION> would need an awfully big checkbook,'' said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosak </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Eberstadt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION>'s stock hit a peak of $ 199.50 in 1987, but has slumped badly since then. The company has no dividend to support the stock, so buybacks are one of the few ways to reward shareholders. `` We believe buying our stock is an attractive investment and a sound way to build a shareholder value,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Osterhoff </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for finance, said in a news release. Digital purchased 3 million shares of its stock for $ 363 million in January and 5 million shares for $ 782 million in a program completed in May 1987. Those shares were used for employee stock plans.

 The stock market finished narrowly mixed Tuesday as a feeding frenzy in takeover issues subsided. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, off 13 points Monday, gained 3.02 to close at 2,173.36. The key index had seesawed within a 2-point range for much of the session. Declining issues narrowly outpaced advancers in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 701 issues up, 727 down and 525 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> came to 155.19 million shares, down from 170.59 million. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled 183.30 million shares. The market appeared steady throughout most of the session as little fresh takeover news emerged. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Puccio </PERSON>, a senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Dillon </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Read </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, noted that the market `` has kind of dried up'' following a recent string of multibillion-dollar takeover announcements involving companies with high-profile brand names. But while stocks that are the target of deals and takeover speculation have basked in the spotlight, the broader market has missed much of the enthusiasm. `` The broader market seems to have settled back into its malaise,'' said <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Albany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` People seem to have retreated to the sidelines until another news event comes along,'' he said. On a more subtle level, some analysts are beginning to wonder whether some skepticism is settling in among investors who are concerned about the sheer size of the latest crop of deals. The largest proposal to date is <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 20.3 billion bid for <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION>. `` People are starting to question whether we can get the financing done to get all these large mergers completed,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. `` A substantial amount of financing has to be completed in a very short time ... and there's a healthy skepticism creeping in.'' While some traders were preoccupied with the release on Wednesday of third-quarter gross national product figures, many predicted the government's report would be a non-event. As <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> noted, the report looks back to the third quarter while the market is looking ahead to the first quarter of 1989. Among <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> takeover issues, <PERSON> Nabisco </PERSON> was up 1 at 85; <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> fell 3 to 99, <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> was off -LRB- at 59 -LCB-, and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point-Pepperell </LOCATION> was off 1 ~ at 48 -LRB- Elsewhere, <ORGANIZATION> Rorer </ORGANIZATION> rose 3 -RRB- to 45 -RRB- amid speculation that F. Hoffman-LaRoche might launch a $ 60-a-share takeover bid. <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> declined comment. Church's Fried Chicken was up ~ at 8 -LRB-. The company received an $ 8-a-share bid from Popeyes Fried Chicken. <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> plunged 9 to 59 ~ following the release of lower-than-expected earnings for the third quarter <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> rose 2 to 92. The company announced plans to buy back shares with a current market value of more than $ 900 million. Analysts said the news gave a boost to other technology issues. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market lost $ 190 million. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> index was at up .02 at 158.87. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's industrial index gained .18 to 325.66, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index was up .10 to 282.38. At the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the market value index stood at 304.38, down .57. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market closed at 386.12, down 1.11.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Bond prices were mixed in lackluster trading Tuesday amid continued investor concern about an oversupply of long-term government securities. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s closely watched 30-year bond declined 3-16 point, or about $ 1.80 for every $ 1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves inversely to its price and is often an indicator of interest rate trends, rose to 8.93 percent from 8.91 percent late Monday. Bond prices had weakened slightly last week as investors anticipated a vote in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to remove the cap on 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues. On Monday, long-term bond prices declined further after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> voted to allow the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> to sell more long-term bonds. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> is expected to announce on Nov. 2 plans to issue between $ 8.5 billion and $ 9 billion of 30-year bonds in its quarterly financing. Analysts said Tuesday's continuing weakness was due to ongoing investor concern in the absence of more significant economic data. Bondholders fear that a big increase in the supply of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds would depress their price. `` People are waiting to get more fundamental data of a more significant nature like tomorrow's GNP report,'' said <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginste </PERSON> <PERSON> Reiners </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to release gross national product figures for the third quarter on Wednesday. The market virtually ignored two economic reports on Tuesday suggesting lower inflation and a further weakening of the economy, analysts said. One report by the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said factory orders for durable goods fell 4.1 percent in September. A second report by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> said sales of existing single-family homes fell 2.2 percent last month. `` There was nothing surprising in either report,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, an economist with the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> investment firm of <ORGANIZATION> Stein </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Farnham </LOCATION>. `` People do n't pay much attention to durable goods because they are so volatile from month to month. And higher interest rates have dampened home sales as expected.'' In the secondary market for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues, prices of short-term governments were unchanged, intermediate maturities ranged from 1-32 point lower to 3-32 point higher and the 20-year issue slipped 1-32 point, according to figures provided by <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a financial information service. The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $ 10 in the price of a bond with a $ 1,000 face value. The <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Bond Index, which measures price movements on all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues with maturities of a year or longer, slipped 0.15 to 1,148.87. In corporate trading, industrials were up slightly. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, rose 0.21 at 294.47 Yields on three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills, meanwhile, rose to 7.70 percent as the discount rose to 7.46 percent. Yields on six-month bills was unchanged at 7.95 percent with the discount flat at 7.55 percent. Yields on one-year bills declined to 8.16 percent with the discount down 1 basis point at 7.59 percent. The yield is the annualized return on an investment in a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bill. The discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at maturity. The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was quoted late in the day at 8 \ percent, down from 85-16 percent late Monday

 The owner of Popeyes Famous Fried Chicken and Biscuits said Tuesday it was launching a cash tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fried </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicken </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> that values its fast-food chicken restaurant rival at about $ 290 million. The deal would combine the second and third largest fast-food chicken chains in the nation. The biggest is <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fried </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicken </ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION> Pepsico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Purchase </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> A. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Copeland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, said it was offering $ 8 a share for each of <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s 36 million shares. Church's management, based in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, urged its shareholders to defer tendering their shares until its board could review the offer and make a recommendation. Analysts said the bidding could go higher. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, Church's stock rose 87 -LCB- cents a share to $ 8.12 -LCB-. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON>, who follows the fast-food business for the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the offer is `` reasonable and fair in one sense.'' `` However, in this day and age of takeovers, the first offer is generally not the last from the original offeree,'' <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> said. `` Generally, the company under siege will try to come up with a higher alternative offer.'' The offer, which is to expire at midnight Nov. 22, is conditioned upon tender of enough shares to give <ORGANIZATION> Copeland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> two-thirds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s shares on a fully-diluted basis and upon obtaining sufficient financing <ORGANIZATION> Copeland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> said it already owns nearly 1.2 million shares, or 3.2 percent, of Church's shares. `` We intend to pursue it on an amicable basis,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>, <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON>'s president. <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON>, Popeyes chairman and chief executive, said in a statement, `` The combination of Popeyes' proven industry expertise in generating high per store sales on the basis of a superior quality menu and Church's loyal customer base in its core markets will create a dynamic fast-food restaurant operation.'' Church's board of directors said it will make a recommendation to its stockholders by Nov. 7 whether they should accept the offer and why. `` Church's requests that its stockholders defer making a decision to accept or reject the offer until they have been advised of the company's position,'' the company said in a statement. Church's is the second-largest purveyor of fast-food chicken in the country behind No. 1 <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fried </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicken </ORGANIZATION> New Orleans-based Popeyes, founded in 1972, is the third largest, said <ORGANIZATION> Sawyer-Miller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Bivings </PERSON>. Church's has 1,478 outlets in 34 states and several foreign countries, a company spokeswoman said. Popeyes has 705 stores in 36 states and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. The merger of the two cahains probably would not radically change the the national fried chicken business, <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> said. `` Big is not necessarily better,'' <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think it would make much of an impact on the <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fried </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicken </ORGANIZATION> chain. I think Kentucky Fried Chicken is much stronger than the Church's and Popeyes chains.'' <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said hisd company would keep the restaurants' menus separate with the possibility of adding some new products at Church's `` We intend to maintain two systems, and Church's would remain a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio-based </LOCATION> company,'' he said.

 Four of the nation's oil companies reported huge gains in their third-quarter profits Tuesday as hefty demand in refining and marketing segments offset declining crude oil prices. <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> each reported double-digit gains, while profits at <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> more than doubled in the latest period. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Amerada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> each reported sharp declines in their net earnings due partly to declining crude oil prices. The larger oil companies said earnings were both hurt and helped by falling crude prices. Lower costs for the raw product contributed to higher profit margins in refining and marketing operations but eroded gains in exploration and production. <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> said his company's refining and marketing segments turned in strong performances thanks to improved margins stemming from tight refinery capacity and product inventories. In addition, strong consumer demand boosted sales of gasoline and lubricants. <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION>'s chemical unit also reported a record quarter, <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> said. However, those improvements were partially offset by a 26 percent drop in crude prices and higher exploration costs, which lowered the companies' profits from exploration and production. Analysts attribute most of this year's drop in crude prices to the excess supply of oil on world markets arising from the failure of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> to restrain its production. For the latest quarter, New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> had an after-tax profit of $ 557 million, or $ 1.36 a share, up 69 percent from $ 330 million, or 80 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Revenue totaled $ 13.12 billion, down a fraction from $ 13.14 billion in the year-ago period. For the first nine months, profits at the nation's second-largest oil company rose 86 percent to $ 1.62 billion, or $ 3.95 a share, compared with $ 874 million, or $ 2.13 a share, in the same period last year. Revenue totaled $ 40.99 billion, up 10 percent from $ 37.12 billion in the year-earlier period. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's third-largest oil company based in <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, reported a 121 percent rise in its third-quarter profits, to $ 239 million, or 98 cents a share, from $ 108 million, or 44 cents a share, in the 1987 quarter. Sales totaled $ 8.69 billion, down 3 percent from $ 8.96 billion last year. For the first nine months, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s profits jumped 183 percent to $ 1.01 billion, or $ 4.14 a share, compared with $ 355 million, or $ 1.46 a share, for the same period in 1987. Revenue totaled $ 26.8 billion, up 3 percent from $ 26 billion in the 1987 period. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnear </PERSON> said the company is beginning to see benefits from its recent restructuring. San Francisco-based <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION>, the fourth-largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil concern, said its profits rose 41 percent to $ 420 million, or $ 1.23 a share, in the third quarter, compared with $ 297 million, or 87 cents a share, in the 1987 period. <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION>'s revenue, meanwhile, dropped 6.4 percent in the latest quarter to $ 7.2 billion, from $ 7.7 billion last year. For the year, <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings jumped 57 percent to $ 1.6 billion, or $ 4.66 a share, from $ 1.01 billion, or $ 2.97 a share. Its revenue rose to $ 22 billion, up 1.3 percent from $ 21.7 billion. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, based in <LOCATION> Bartlesville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, reported the strongest quarterly profit gains _ nearly sixfold _ to $ 215 million, or 89 cents a share, from $ 31 million, or 11 cents a share. The company's sales totaled $ 2.85 billion, up a fraction from $ 2.80 billion Since January, <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>' net surged to $ 515 million, or $ 2.17 a share, from $ 2 million in the comparable 1987 period. It had revenue of $ 8.5 billion, up 7.6 percent from $ 7.9 billion. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>' spokesman <PERSON> Jere </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said a major streamlining, which included the layoff of more than 1,500 workers, contributed to the latest figures. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION>, the sixth-largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil company, said sagging crude prices pulled its quarterly earnings down 16.2 percent. The company's net was $ 352 million on revenue of $ 5.4 billion, compared with $ 420 million in the 1987 quarter on sales of $ 5.6 billion. The company does not report per-share figures. But for the first nine months, Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION>'s net improved 134 percent to $ 1.9 billion, on revenue of $ 15.9 billion, compared with a profit in the same period last year of $ 795 million, on revenue of $ 15.3 billion. Lower crude prices also contributed to a 47 percent drop in <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION>'s latest earnings, which declined 47 percent to $ 72 million, or 67 a share, from $ 137 million, or $ 1.27 a share Its revenue totaled $ 2.46 billion, down 2.3 percent from $ 2.52 billion. Sun, headquartered in <LOCATION> Radnor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, reported a $ 69 million loss for the first nine months, on revenue of $ 7.3 billion, compared with a profit of $ 265 million in 1987, or $ 2.44 a share, on revenue of $ 7.2 billion. New York-based <PERSON> Amerada </PERSON> <PERSON> Hess </PERSON> reported a 59 percent decline in its quarterly net to $ 15.8 million, or 20 cents a share, from $ 38.6 million, or 45 cents a share.

A & amp; P spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Rourke </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Montvale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, was not immediately available for comment Tuesday on the rejection. <ORGANIZATION> Delchamps </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said the board's decision was based on a number of factors, including <ORGANIZATION> Delchamps </ORGANIZATION> recent store expansion efforts and other programs which will enhance the value of the company He said the board's decision was also based upon the advice of counsel that significant antitrust issues exist with respect to the A & amp; P merger proposal and the opinion of its financial advisor, <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, that the $ 32 per share proposal is inadequate.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday posted a $ 50.4 million loss for its third quarter, due to costs of a corporate restructuring and expenses of thwarting a hostile takeover bid. <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> said the after-tax loss came on sales of $ 436.3 million, compared with a profit of $ 24.4 million, or 39 cents a share, on sales of $ 425.9 million in the same period of 1987. <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> said the loss includes a $ 97 million charge to cover costs associated with the restructuring, which included elimination of 1,300 workers under a voluntary severance plan, planned global distribution of 35mm color film and a $ 300 million employee stock ownership plan. <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>, which faces a hostile buyout bid from <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> family-owned <ORGANIZATION> Shamrock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, also attributed the decline for the quarter ending Oct. 2 to start-up costs for its new Impulse camera line. Polaroid spokesman <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Yanes </PERSON> said the company spent more than $ 5 million on legal fees in the Shamrock battle and the bulk of the losses were due to the severance payments. `` Our third quarter net results reflect a variety of temporary factors that we expect to be behind us after the fourth quarter,'' Polaroid President <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> MacAllister </PERSON> <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> said in a statement. But the company also said it expects to charge another $ 50 million in the fourth quarter to cover remaining costs of the restructuring, announced in July.

<HEAD>Posts 24 Percent Earnings Gain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that its third-quarter earnings climbed 24.1 percent as sales rose 8.4 percent overall and results from its supermarkets in virtually every major market were ahead of last year. The results were released as the nation's largest supermarket operator was undertaking a $ 4.6 billion restructuring to fight off takeover bids. The company said earnings rose to $ 56.2 million, or 65 cents a share, in the third quarter from $ 45.3 million, or 54 cents a share, a year earlier. Third-quarter sales increased to $ 5.58 billion from $ 5.15 billion in 1987. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> management said the sales increase was in line with projections the company made as part of its corporate restructuring plan. The plan involves dividend payoffs to shareholders, sale of some company assets including stores, and the previously-disclosed dismissal of 300 headquarters employees. `` Sales vitality will be a critical measure of the company's ability to generate sufficient cash to meet its debt obligations after <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>'s special restructuring dividend is distributed, as anticipated, to shareholders Friday,'' the company said in a statement For the year to date, <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings increased 13 percent to $ 153.5 million, or $ 1.81 per share, from $ 135.9 million, or $ 1.62 per share, before the effect of a change in accounting for income taxes, the company said. Counting the change, the company's earnings fell 22.9 percent to $ 153.5 million from $ 199.2 million a year earlier. Nine-month sales totaled $ 14.4 billion, an increase of 8.7 percent from $ 13.3 billion last year. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>'s restructuring plan, which the company's board of directors approved on Sept. 23, calls for payment to shareholders of a special cash dividend of $ 40 per share, plus a debenture with an estimated trading value of $ 8. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> management says the plan will allow shareholders to retain their interests in what will be a smaller, but still independent company.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday that its profit more than doubled in the third quarter from a year earlier, boosted partly by strong results from its oil operations. The financial services and commodity trading company said its net income in the three months ended Sept. 30 jumped to $ 65 million, or 37 cents a share, from $ 27 million, or 18 cents a share, a year earlier. The increased profit occurred despite a 17.3 percent decline in third-quarter revenue to $ 1.29 billion from $ 1.56 billion. The company's <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> financial subsidiary earned $ 86 million before taxes in the quarter, up from $ 49 million a year earlier. <PERSON> Salomon </PERSON> said its <ORGANIZATION> Phibro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> unit had pretax earnings of $ 45 million, triple the year before. It attributed the growth to strong profits from oil refining and trading, high demand for gasoline, and savings resulting from the second-quarter acquisition of a refinery in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Other commodity trading operations incurred a combined loss of $ 15 million, compared with a $ 5 million profit in the third quarter of last year. In the first nine months of the year, <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION>'s profit rose 47.2 percent _ to $ 318 million, or $ 2 a share, from $ 216 million, or $ 1.40 a share.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s international debt is far smaller than the government's figures indicate, according to a new study whose authors say misleading figures have led to exaggerated fears of economic decline. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said by the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to have become a net debtor nation in 1985, actually remained in the black until last year, according to the study by the <ORGANIZATION> Rand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` The big point about this is ... that the public debate has been misinformed and ill-served by frequent reiteration of flawed numbers,'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, director of Rand's international economic policy research, said Tuesday. The figure in question, called the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> international investment position, is a cumulative total of all American spending and investment overseas compared to foreign spending and investment in this country. The study by the government-funded think tank indicates that in 1985, when <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> figures showed the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was a net debtor to the tune of $ 112 billion, the country actually was a $ 178 billion net creditor. In 1986, when the government figure was a minus $ 263 billion, the Rand recalculation had the country a creditor nation by $ 50 billion. In 1988, government figures indicated the country was $ 368 billion in debt. Rand researchers have n't calculated their version of the 1988 number, but know it would be negative, <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said. The Rand study, conducted under <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>'s direction by <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> graduate student <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooker </PERSON>, adjusts the government's measures in several ways: _ It converts `` direct investment,'' the department's measure of private holdings of foreign capital, including real estate, to current dollar Because much American investment overseas was made years ago, when the dollar was worth less than today, this increases the vaue of Americans' foreign holdings relative to foreigners' more recent investments in this country. _ It boosts the value of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> gold reserves, another component of the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> figure, by using a market price of $ 380 per ounce rather than the department's `` official'' price of $ 42.22 an ounce _ On the negative side, the researchers cut the value of loans owed to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks by developing nations Based on the theory that many of these shaky loans will never be repaid, the study fixed their value at what they would bring on the secondary market, where banks trade debts of various kinds. These adjustments reflect previously voiced criticism of the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> figures. But the researchers believe they are the first to actually recalculate the department numbers based on the criticism, <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said. Even after the changes, the numbers show a steady slide in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position. That is n't necessarily bad, <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said, to the extent that it represents foreigners' confidence in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> economy as a safe, stable haven for their money. `` The point is, you do n't contribute to what we like to think of as an informed and educated debate by using figures that are $ 300 million off the mark,'' <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said. `` ... There's a perception problem in how you view the situation: Is it grave, or serious, or just a matter of concern. ... I think it's a matter of concern.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Del </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Webb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nugget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday they had mutually terminated their Oct. 2 preliminary agreement under which <PERSON> Golden </PERSON> <PERSON> Nugget </PERSON> was to acquire the <LOCATION> Claridge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hotel-Casino </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> for $ 110 million. In a news release, <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> said various difficulties had made it impossible to proceed with a definitive agreement. A primary difficulty was a determination that certain operational changes requested by Golden Nugget from the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> could not be granted under applicable law, <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> stated.

The company and <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boardwalk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> have been seeking a possible buyer since May for the 501-room <PERSON> Claridge </PERSON>. Hotel president <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> had indicated that more than 170 potential purchasers contacted <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>'s investment banker, <ORGANIZATION> Oppenheimer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, about the <PERSON> Claridge </PERSON>. <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> suffered a $ 96.6 million net loss in 1987, with the <PERSON> Claridge </PERSON> responsible for 78.8 percent of the loss. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dion </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, said the company had presented to the NJCCC a restructuring proposal for the Claridge which substantially reduced the facility's debt and would allow it to operate on a solid financial basis. The proposal, which is awaiting commission approval, was developed by <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> prior to the Oct. 2 announcement of the preliminary agreement with <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nugget </ORGANIZATION>, the company said. <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> has been selling off assets in its leisure group, which includes other casino and recreational properties.

<HEAD>China To Impose Export Tax on Silk</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> on Wednesday will begin levying export tariffs of up to 100 percent on silk and its products to stop a `` silk cocoon war'' that has pushed up prices. The official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the 100 percent tariff will be levied on silkworm cocoon, raw silk, waste silk, silk yarn and spun silk. Duties on silk, silk noil and fabrics made of waste silk will be 80 percent, it said. The new duties, announced by the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tariff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION>, will affect all silk exports regardless of when contracts were signed. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> produces about 50,000 tons of cocoon silk annually, of which 70 percent is for export. Ninety percent of raw silk and 40 percent of gray silk goods on international markets come from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, according to the official <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION>. The Chinese government last month stated the <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Silk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Import </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Export </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> will undertake the unified handling of silkworm cocoons, including exports, to halt the price war among trading companies competing for scarce cocoons. It banned all other departments and individuals from purchasing or handling silkworm cocoons and said Sino-foreign joint ventures must apply for export permits in accordance with state-assigned export quotas. Despite increasing demand for <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> silk, cocoon production has declined recently due to bad weather and low state-set prices. Factories in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and other cities have been forced to stop production because of shortages of cocoons and filature silk. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Daily reported last week that Chinese silk traders were turning down new customers at the <ORGANIZATION> Canton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fair </ORGANIZATION> and there would be a sharp drop in export contracts compared with previous fairs. It said <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> silk prices have risen by about 20 percent since last spring.
