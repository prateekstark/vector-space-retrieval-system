 A doctor committed no crime when he brandished a pistol at a dog that went after his miniature pig in his backyard, a judge ruled. District Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivill </PERSON> on Wednesday dismissed charges against Dr. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrera </PERSON>, 36, who was charged with recklessly endangering another person, simple assault and disorderly conduct in the incident. <PERSON> Barrera </PERSON>'s neighbor, <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, testified he and his wife were caring for a stray dog, a young Siberian husky weighing about 40 pounds, when the dog got away from him and went after <PERSON> Barrera </PERSON>'s miniature pig next door <PERSON> Barrera </PERSON> started waving a pistol at the dog but `` did not point the gun directly at me,'' <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said. But, <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said, `` I felt like I was being intimidated.'' Testimony showed that neither animal was injured and no shots were fired in this <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> suburb. <PERSON> Ivill </PERSON> said <PERSON> Barrera </PERSON> was on his own property and was licensed to carry a gun. He ruled <PERSON> Barrera </PERSON> was a man `` preparing to defend his pet from a trespassing animal.'' <PERSON> Barrera </PERSON> said he obtained the gun for protection and the pig because `` I'm asthmatic and allergic to dogs and cats.''

 The so-called February ratings sweep indicate <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> have rebounded from last year's writers' strike, but network executives say the September-April `` season'' used to track the ratings race should be yearlong. `` I know you guys love races,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Poltrack </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> vice president for marketing, `` but any discussion of full-season results is a historical curiosity and not a marketing issue, and a disservice to us.'' <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wurtzel </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s senior vice president for marketing and research, said the season race is now `` a spectator sport'' and means nothing except for bragging rights. `` In 1989, to say there is a ` season' is so antiquated,'' said <PERSON> Wurtzel </PERSON>. `` That means we would be abdicating the audience five months of the year, and that's not something we can afford to do.'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Brandon </PERSON> <PERSON> Tartikoff </PERSON> has long held that the ratings race season should be year-round, too, but such talk did n't come up at Thursday's <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> briefing on the February sweep rating period _ one of four months a year when local TV ratings are measured to determine advertising rates. But then, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> is winning another season hands-down. Ten years ago when the average viewer had few channels available, the networks did n't have to worry about losing their audience to competition from cable or videocassettes over the summer, but times have changed. The audience that has access to an average of 25 channels will go elsewhere if the networks fail to offer them what they want to watch. In February, the networks did. The <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> miniseries `` Lonesome Dove'' and the heated competition it encouraged boosted the networks' aggregate rating after a more than yearlong decline. The four-night `` Lonesome Dove'' boosted third-place CBS above <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> in the February sweep and makes second place for the season a tossup. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> won the sweep with an average <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> rating of 16.3. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> had a 14.7 and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> a 12.4. The rating is a percentage of 90.4 million <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> homes with televisions. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> had a 28 percent decline in February compared to February 1988, when it had the Winter Olympics. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> showed increases this February over last. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> was forced, because of the writers' strike, to run the first 18-hour stretch of its 32-hour miniseries `` War and Remembrance'' in November. Hardly a ratings blockbuster, it still did better than <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s regular programming. The decision to run the program then came back to haunt the network in February when `` War and Remembrance'' was to have run. `` Clearly we had a disappointing sweeps,'' said <PERSON> Wurtzel </PERSON>. `` We did not have an enormous inventory, because we had to play ` War and Remembrance' early, and we had planned to play it in February,'' he said. `` The other two networks knew that and planned accordingly.'' CBS got a big push, both in ratings and morale, from the critically acclaimed `` Lonesome Dove,'' the highest-rated network miniseries in more than four years. But the miniseries' success pleased <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, too. `` I think ` Lonesome Dove' was beneficial to everybody,'' said <PERSON> Wurtzel </PERSON>. `` Network television needs to have exciting, well-made programming.'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> even used figures from the week of `` Lonesome Dove'' to contend that network `` reach'' has not declined in the past decade, even if ratings have. `` Say we -LRB- the networks -RRB- are all throwing a party,'' explained <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for research projects. `` The same number of people come to the party, but instead of staying 2 -LCB- hours, maybe they stay two hours, then they go to someone else's party.''

 Where drivers passing the maximum-security <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> State Prison see a grim, century-old building of hand-hewn granite blocks and iron window bars, Disney production people saw a set for <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Selleck </PERSON>'s next movie. They wanted a building with a forbidden look for `` Hard Rain,'' a story set in a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> prison in the early 1900s. Producer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cort </PERSON> and director <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> considered about 60 prisons and visited 15 sites before deciding to film outdoor scenes at the prison, located on the outskirts of the state capital in the high desert of northwest <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> facility was chosen because it had two yards, and `` we could be guaranteed that their security would not interfere with our work and our work would n't interfere with their security,'' said <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Pasternak </PERSON>, the movie's unit publicist. <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Holabird </PERSON>, deputy director of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>'s film office, said while the Disney movie is the most recent planned for the prison, her office receives a steady stream of requests for information and visits from producers interested in filming at the historic building. `` When they come scouting, we tell them we're interested and will take extra steps so they know we're serious about making a movie,'' she said. `` If all we could offer them was a new jail, it could not have been done.'' With `` Hard Rain,'' <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> joins a growing number of governments marketing prisons as movie sets to attract the millions of dollars local economies can generate from <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> movie-makers looking beyond <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> for new locations and lower production costs. `` We've got lots of competition when it comes to prisons,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsden </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Culture </ORGANIZATION> film board in <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, which tried unsuccessfully to attract the <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> by offering a vacant 19th century prison and prisoners from a neighboring jail as extras for `` Hard Rain.'' `` Now there are so many film commissions that when producers send out circulars saying they're looking for a prison, they're sorting through photos for weeks,'' <PERSON> Marsden </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> caught the attention of filmmakers by featuring the vacant state penitentiary in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> in a `` Prison for Rent'' advertising campaign that ran in movie catalogs and magazines. `` It described it almost like a real estate dialogue on a piece of property: ` complete with electric chair,''' said <PERSON> R.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavallaro </PERSON>, assistant manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> stopped running the `` Prison for Rent'' advertisement a year ago, <PERSON> Cavallaro </PERSON> said, partly because the campaign's success stereotyped the state as a location for making prison movies. `` We do have a lot of prisons and we really are grateful that filmmakers think of us when they think of prison movies, but we also have to promote the rest of a very diverse state,'' he said. <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> state officials recently began an aggressive campaign promoting two state prisons by mailing out color fliers to 9,000 movie makers, according to <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. `` We've had a couple of feature films shot here recently and they brought in several million dollars in a short period of time. We want to open the doors up to bring in more of that money and work for <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> people,'' he said. <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> wardens were enthusiastic about advertising their prisons and have agreed to let crews film in working prisons. `` They realize they're part of our economic development effort just like anyone else,'' he said. <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s chief warden no longer allows movie-makers in the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prison </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION>, once a popular location for films, because of security and discipline concerns, according to <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> McCallum </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> McCallum </PERSON> now passes requests for the <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION> prison, featured in `` Stir Crazy'' and `` Raising <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>,'' on to states with available prisons. `` We've probably lost millions of dollars because we ca n't get the business,'' he said. In addition to money the local <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> economy can expect to make from `` Hard Rain'' when <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> hires local workers and buys supplies, the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> State Prison itself will get economic benefits from the movie, according to Lt. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Budge </PERSON>, a prison official and consultant for the movie. `` They had to give something to the inmates, and they're donating money to the inmate welfare fund, and with that money we're purchasing recreational equipment,'' he said Budge said the prison will get to keep a truck and 350 sets of inmate denims Disney is supplying for the movie. `` They're also building a permanent guard post and adding fencing and razor wire because they want it to look more confining, and that only adds to our security,'' he said. The announcement that <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> planned to make a movie at the prison also improved discipline among inmates, 300 of whom will be hired as extras, <PERSON> Budge </PERSON> said. `` Nobody wants to get locked up and miss their chance to be in the movie,'' he said.

 President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> says he was once asked by a farmer what he was trying to accomplish with all his reforms. `` Simply, we want, in spite of everything ... for working people to lead a better life,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said he replied. `` I thought it was enough to say.'' Perhaps it's as simple as that: the quaint wish of a Russian peasant's son who grew up in such hardship that at one point he was kept out of school for want of shoes. But he was taught to dream in the time of <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>, another reformist Soviet leader of humble origins, and indications are <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> dreams of grander, more profound changes not just for the people but for the state. Seventy years after the Russian Revolution, the Soviet economy is in serious trouble and communism has not provided a better life for workers who yearn for bigger apartments, better working conditions, more nourishing and varied food. And an economy ruled from the center has not kept pace with the technology of the West. In what would by American measure be a full presidential term, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has made wholesale changes in the way the world perceives him and the nation he leads. He has thrown open prisons and labor camps and, in some cases, borders to free thousands of political prisoners and permit tens of thousands of people to leave the country. He has eased, although certainly not eliminated, the fear of foreigners. Under `` glasnost'' he has converted the mass media from a tightly controlled propaganda organ to a braying calliope of complaints, debates, exposes and experiments testing just how far the new openness may go _ and to what purpose. Yet for all his effort, the changes at home have been largely atmospheric. His plans for `` perestroika,'' or restructuring Soviet society, have faltered. The forces that keep this vast nation a drab, monolithic parody of the communist state envisioned by its founders resist each tangible step toward that `` better life'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> seeks for those he calls `` the simple people who are the salt of our countries.'' Store shelves are barren. Meat, butter, cheese and sugar are widely rationed. Such simple necessities as winter boots and windshield wipers are perpetually unavailable, and consumers may wait for years to buy long-outdated models of `` modern conveniences'' such as washing machines, cars or even electric irons. The air in urban areas is filthy, the water unreliable, living quarters poorly planned and filled far beyond capacity. Crash construction programs produce instant ruins: crumbling high rises barely habitable by the time they are occupied years after their first cracked concrete slabs were laid to start them on their way. One of the imponderables of this tumultuous time is how long even a remarkably dynamic and politically astute leader has to accomplish the goals he has set for himself, fighting the shortcomings of the system and inertia-bound bureaucrats. One simple measure of how long the road is and how much time progress takes: Last summer, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> set as a national goal the installation of a telephone in just one-half of all Soviet homes by 1995. People in urban areas wait years for a phone, and many rural districts do n't have any service. Villagers five miles from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> draw their water from community wells. It is a fundamental tenet of official <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> analysis that the `` better life'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> seeks for his countrymen is not an end in itself but the means of maintaining his nation's superpower status in a fast-changing world. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, according to that view, can no longer afford its own military might and ca n't use its power to keep pace with _ or even steal _ the technology that is quickly increasing the gulf between the industrialized West and the long-stagnant East. As <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has pressed for more discussion of problems, modernization of services, development of private initiative and greater public participation in the political process, Westerners have been tempted to think he is trying to fashion a nation resembling the world's other great superpower, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. A pragmatic leader who calls himself a realist, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> repeatedly insists he intends to work within the framework of socialism. Both he and <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON>, said to be his closest adviser, have written books critical of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and what they said was its intolerance for other ways of life and thought. Regardless of any personal vision, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is pushed by economic reality to reorder Soviet priorities. `` He does n't have the resources to sustain the investments the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is making in foreign policy and defense,'' said one Western analyst who discussed the issue on condition he not be identified. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> estimates the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> devotes 15 percent to 25 percent of its gross national product to the military. `` Even the lower end of that range would be enormous by world standards,'' the analyst said. `` The upper end is truly staggering. But that's not all, because that same 15 to 25 percent monopolizes the country's scientific and technological resources and people.'' To begin reducing those figures, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> already has negotiated the first treaty reducing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> nuclear arsenals and has announced substantial unilateral reductions in Soviet grounds forces at home and abroad, including this month's completion of the withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` Part of the reordering of priorities is to work on what <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> calls the ` enemy image,''' the analyst said. `` He has to persuade other leaders he's serious and lower the perception of risk in the rest of the world.''

 Even in good times it's hard for Southerners to trash anything that comes from a hog, hence the presidential snack, pork rinds. `` You do n't throw nothing away,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Nahunta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pork </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. `` You use everything from a hog but the squeal.'' `` It's the finest food substance available on the planet,'' said state Sen. <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Duplin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> hog farmer and one of the largest pork producers in the nation. Hogs provide hams, pork chops, bacon and sausage. Their feet are pickled, the intestines are used as casings for sausage, the tails are used for seasoning and the hide ends up in fancy driving gloves, <ORGANIZATION> Hush </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Puppy </ORGANIZATION> shoes and President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s favorite munchie. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, who produces pork rinds, thinks it's great that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> prefers them with Tabasco sauce. But if the president wants some of <LOCATION> Nahunta </LOCATION>'s home-style skins, he'll have to come to this crossroads 50 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION> to get them. `` It will probably be good for the pork industry, but there's not much way for it to help our business,'' said <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, whose father founded the company 24 years ago. `` We process 100 skins a week and ca n't meet the demand from our customers as it is.'' The pork company, which makes up most of <LOCATION> Nahunta </LOCATION>, started as a slaughterhouse in 1955 and added retail pork sales in 1975. It does not distribute its products, but more than 3,000 people a week come by to pick out fresh pork and cured hams. They also grab up 99-cent bags of <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s salted and deep-fried pork skins. `` We process about 500 hogs a week,'' <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said, `` but we're real particular about the skins we use If they are n't quite up to snuff, we wo n't use them. That's why we only turn about 100 skins a week into pork rinds.'' A special machine slices the skin off of pork pieces. The skin pieces are cooked for four hours in vats to dry out the fat. Then the hard, shriveled skins are deep fried. The pieces of skin swell and pop, turning into puffy slabs of rind in minutes. `` This is our scientific measuring process,'' <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said as he dipped a handful of salt from a bucket and spread it over the fried rinds. `` Ones that come out like this, we throw away,'' he said, plucking a dark, hard chunk from among the beige sheets of fried skin. `` And we've got two grades of rinds. `` The ones that come out really nice and thin are No. Ones,'' he said. `` Your thicker skins that come out a little tougher are No. Twos.'' A bag of No. Ones, which weighs a little more than 3 ounces, and a 12-ounce bag of No. Twos go for the same price _ 99 cents. `` We actually sell more of the No. Twos,'' <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said. `` People seem to like to gnaw on them a little bit.'' A half-ounce serving of pork rinds provides little in the way of nutrition; potato chips and peanuts have more nutrients, but also more fat and cholesterol. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> analysis showed a two-ounce package of rinds contains 315 calories; 32.5 grams of protein; 18.9 grams of fat; 58 milligrams of cholesterol; and 1,054 milligrams of salt. The <ORGANIZATION> Snack </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said pork rind sales nationally totaled $ 195 million in 1987, a figure dwarfed by potato chips, which had $ 3.8 billion in sales the same year. <PERSON> Dwayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pilkington </PERSON>, a professor of food science at <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said the origin of pork rinds is lost in history. `` I do n't know when people started popping skins or why,'' <PERSON> Pilkington </PERSON> said. `` I do n't know if it's a takeoff from the old days of crackling or what.'' Crackling, or cracklin', is hog fat that has the lard squeezed out of it and is then cooked. In some areas, the layer of fat was ground up with the skin to make the crisp treat. `` It could be that somebody had a piece of skin left over from cracklin', put it on a stove and it popped, sort of an accidental discovery,'' <PERSON> Pilkington </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said he is n't sure why pork rinds have remained a regional delicacy, limited mainly to the South. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, who raises a million hogs a year, said other areas of the country have just lagged behind the South in realizing how good pork rinds are. `` Anybody that does n't like them has just never tasted them,'' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, a Democrat, said he was aware of the Republican president's use of symbolism in the 1988 campaign, but he did not believe <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> used pork rinds as a populist snack to fight a less-than-macho image. `` I really think he ate them before the presidential campaign,'' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said. `` But maybe nobody paid much attention to what he ate when he was n't the president. The office sure changes that.''

 A 60-day, 1,200-mile ski and dog sled trek from <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> will be more celebration than exploration for a dozen <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet adventurers setting out this weekend. Aside from cold-weather research, the primary object of the Bering Bridge Expedition across seldom-visited sections of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and arctic <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> is good will, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Schurke </PERSON>, 33, of <LOCATION> Ely </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, who describes the trip as adventure diplomacy. `` My pocket is full of cross-flagged -LRB- U.S.-Soviet -RRB- pins,'' <PERSON> Schurke </PERSON> said. `` We'll be leaving a full-sized American flag in each Soviet village; a Soviet flag in each <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> village.'' The expedition is an attempt to call attention to the common cultural heritage of the indigenous population of the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> region, <PERSON> Schurke </PERSON> said. Some of the team members have relatives on opposite sides of the border, and it is hoped the trek will result in a relaxation of rules barring visits by natives _ some of whom live within 2 -LCB- miles of one another on islands in the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION>, separated only by sea ice and Cold War politics. The six-member <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> team arrived in this Siberian city of 16,000 Wednesday, after two weather delays. They joined their six Soviet counterparts for a news conference, a VIP dinner and the beginning of several days of medical experiments. It was the first visit in decades by Americans to this treeless city built of locally produced concrete blocks set atop permafrost. Three Soviets and three Americans on the journey are natives, and speak several local dialects including Yupik, a language common to Eskimos in both countries. The trek across ancient trade and migration routes up the Siberian side of the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> and down the Alaskan side is to stop in 16 villages in the <LOCATION> Chukotka </LOCATION> district of <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> and 14 in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, organizers said. It will end about April 1 in <LOCATION> Kotzebue </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, just above the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Circle </LOCATION> and about 550 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>. `` Youth groups have arranged for festivities which will include receptions and sharing of native dances and, hopefully, some native foods,'' <PERSON> Schurke </PERSON> said. `` We expect we will come up with some sort of goodwill ceremony that we'll stick with for each of our visits, and then let it roll spontaneously.'' Negotiations began a week ago between the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the Soviets on re-opening the border closed by the Soviets during the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> blockade in 1948. <PERSON> Schurke </PERSON> said he hoped a treaty might be ready for signing as early as April 1 on the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> ice. `` What marks this trip is the sheer volume of human contact,'' said <PERSON> Schurke </PERSON>, veteran of an unsupplied sled dog expedition to the North Pole in 1986. `` The populations of the villages we will be visiting totals close to 50,000.'' Most of the journey will be on relatively smooth coastal ice, with detours around pressure ridges and open water. There was concern about huge stretches of open water reported near the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> island of Little <PERSON> Diomede </PERSON> and the Soviet island of Big Diomede which flank the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dateline </ORGANIZATION> and the border dividing the two countries. `` There is big water in the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Straits </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Dimitri </PERSON> <PERSON> Shparo </PERSON>, the Soviet co-leader of the expedition who was speaking through an interpreter. `` That could force us to detour several hundred miles north to find ice. `` The farther we go into March, the more the sun will work on the ice,'' the 47-year-old polar explorer said. `` The -LRB- ocean -RRB- current moving through those two islands also is fierce.'' The expedition is only the latest attempt to warm the climate in superpower relations at the point where the nations are closest. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet officials and <PERSON> Eskimos </PERSON> flew from <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Siberian </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Provideniya </LOCATION> for a one-day visit last spring, and a group of Soviets spent the last week of February in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> for talks with government and industry leaders.

 The Pilgrims were happy with venison and beef jerky. Yuppies turned to blackened redfish and quiche. But are you ready for the meal of choice in the 21st century? Try gas flushed chicken. That entree was among an array of culinary choices outlined Thursday that food experts believe may comprise our menus in the future. More encouraging, however, is the ease with which we may buy such items. Video shopping, according to experts, is one possibility. Robot checkout cashiers is another. `` Fast food is too damn slow,'' said <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, editor of New Product News. `` No one has time for fast food anymore.'' But if the food writers and product spokesmen at the 11th annual <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professionals </ORGANIZATION> are correct, we do n't have much to look forward to. They foresee a world where `` cooking becomes something few understand while heating becomes something everyone does.'' Fast food home delivery, triple packaged, resealable potato chips, oat bran popcorn, and `` melting pot ethnic foods'' like the `` burritski'' _ a burrito filled with Polish sausage _ are almost upon us. The real villain, they said, can be summed up in one word: microwave. Because today's busy career people want food on demand, the microwave is threatening to reshape the way we cook and eat, according to <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, director of marketing research for the <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soup </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` They'll probably be one microwave per person in the future,'' said <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, who used a slide show to accompany his address at the convention. `` That way, no one will have to wait to eat.'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> flashed a slide he said symbolized the microwave's impact on society. The picture showed a haughty waiter at a fancy restaurant asking a well-dressed patron, `` How would you like your steak done, sir?'' The customer responded: `` Three minutes on high, turned every 30 seconds.'' But countering the trend toward heavily packaged, microwave food has been the public's demand for fresh food without preservatives. `` The freshly prepared game was started by small entrepreneurs in major urban markets,'' said <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>. `` Now the big boys want to play.'' The challenge facing food manufacturers in the future will be how to create fresh foods with a shelf life while keeping up with continual demands for products to use in the microwave, the panelists said. One example is gas flushed chicken, the term for a high-tech packaging process in which the bird is precooked without preservatives in a vacuum-sealed bag; the end result does n't require refrigeration. `` Convenience, health, indulgence _ those will be the major issues in the future,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerstman </PERSON>, a food consultant with <PERSON> Gerstman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>. The current tendency toward `` cocooning,'' the panelists said, will play a major role in how food is purchased in the future. `` People are just going to want to put on their slippers and turn on the VCR. They wo n't want to go out,'' said <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>. Stores in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> are already testing a cable home food shopping program and a chain in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> is testing automated checkers, the panelists said. But for those who like an occasional foray to the supermarket, they may also find the shopping cart of the future has changed. `` Video carts'' will come with a flashing screen promoting various products. Among harried husbands and wives of the future, the experts predicted, the greeting upon returning home will be `` whose turn is it to heat?''

 NEW SUNDAY TABLOID IN NAKED CITY! This weekend, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> joins the crowd at the city's Sunday newsstands, its Fleet Street tilt a fading memory as it challenges the Daily News and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Newsday for tabloid supremacy on the week's highest-stakes advertising day The Post is confident about its debut Sunday; its competitors are ready and waiting. `` When you see this paper on Saturday night, it's going to look like a Sunday paper that's been around for 30, 40 years,'' promised <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalikow </PERSON>, the real estate magnate who saved the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> from extinction one year ago with a $ 37 million takeover. `` The sections are right, the comics are right, the magazine is right. It's really there.'' To let the public know its plans, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> put commercials on television and a clever full-page advertisement Friday in one of its competitors, The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. The Times ad, in the form of two tabloid-size pages on the back of Times' front section, could be folded to simulate the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>'s front and back pages A banner news headline in the ad said it was `` Announcing A Cure For The Common Sunday.'' Another headline over what would be the sports page reads, `` Post Goes To Game 7!'' Industry analysts question if the financing and the market are right. They predict the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>'s move to Sunday _ where a successful newspaper makes 40 percent to 50 percent of its advertising money _ could mean the demise of at least one of the tabloids. `` The question is whether this market is capable of supporting three daily tabloids. Ask God and the readers,'' said Daily News Editor <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilman </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>. `` This one is in stable shape, without any question. ... We're in good shape to take on all comers.'' <PERSON> Kalikow </PERSON>, on the eve of running out 575,000 copies of the Sunday Post, believes three tabloids can live happily ever after in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Ad space for the first three weeks in the 128-page paper is sold out, including space in the pull-out book and travel sections, <PERSON> Kalikow </PERSON> said. He also cites changes recently made in the competition's Sunday editions as evidence his paper is already a factor: the News' expanded sports page, <ORGANIZATION> Newsday </ORGANIZATION>'s additional color pages <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Newsday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associate </ORGANIZATION> Publisher <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Isenberg </PERSON> said those moves were in works before the Post went weekend. None of this is expected to affect <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> or its massive Sunday edition. The Times can `` stand back and wait, and then see who's left,'' said industry analyst <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Morton </PERSON>. But while <PERSON> Kalikow </PERSON> is confident, others in the industry remain skeptical. The last time the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> had a Sunday edition was during a newspaper strike in 1978. It was scrapped when the strike ended. `` So far, there does not appear to be room for three profitable daily tabloids; that's certainly the same for Sunday,'' said newspaper analyst <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorp </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Provident </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. `` I'm not convinced there's room for two profitable daily tabloids. Agreed <PERSON> Morton </PERSON>, `` The problem is you've got a town that probably ca n't support that many newspapers. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is probably the last remaining city with the market segmentation to support two newspapers. `` But three or four, in the long run, is probably not do-able.'' The Post runs third in the city circulation race, trailing the Daily News -LRB- 1,281,706 -RRB- and The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- 1,038,829 -RRB- and leading <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Newsday -LRB- 176,043 -RRB-, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Audit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circulations </ORGANIZATION> figures from Sept 30, 1988. <PERSON> Kalikow </PERSON> anticipates a similar Sunday showing. <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thorp </PERSON> cited other problems the Post faces: lack of home delivery -LRB- <PERSON> Kalikow </PERSON> says a major push to change that is under way. -RRB-; overcoming Sunday readership loyalty -LRB- <PERSON> Kalikow </PERSON> believes the paper's 550,473 weekday readers will buy the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. -RRB-; tremendous start-up costs -LRB- <PERSON> Kalikow </PERSON>, without mentioning figures, says the Sunday paper is here to stay. -RRB-. Here for the paper's first 12 weeks is a reader inducement _ a $ 1 million stock market game which also will run in weekdays. More likely to draw readers are the changes wrought at the Post under editor <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Amsterdam </PERSON> in the year since <PERSON> Kalikow </PERSON>'s purchase of the paper, which was founded in 1801 by <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>. Gone are many of the <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> flourishes which marked his reign at the Post: no more `` HEADLESS BODY IN TOPLESS BAR'' headlines, no unchallenged liberal-bashing, no jam-packed pages desperate for space. `` Things have improved on a financial basis, the morale has improved, the quality of the paper has improved,'' <PERSON> Kalikow </PERSON> said. `` Things have really improved far beyond what we had ever expected.''

<HEAD>New Survey Shows Most Americans _ Even The Old _ Ignore Flu Shots</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Millions of Americans age 65 and over should get flu shots every year but most do n't bother, in part because of unfounded fears of the vaccine, federal health experts say. The national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that only 12 percent of Americans in a recent survey said they had received an influenza vaccination in the preceding year. That included only 32 percent of those 65 and over, a group at increased risk for death or severe complications from the flu. An official 1990 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> health objective calling for at least 60 percent of older Americans to receive annual flu shots `` is not likely to be met,'' the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> conceded in its report. `` Unfortunately, there are a lot of fears of side effects from the vaccine, and a lot of misconceptions that the vaccine can cause influenza _ neither of which is true,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Sprauer </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> immunization specialist. Current flu vaccines do not cause influenza themselves, and they cause a day or two of fever and aches in fewer than 10 percent of those who take the shot, she said. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>'s survey on health risks and behavior patterns was conducted in 1987 in 31 participating states and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, D.C. Only 7 percent of those 18-44, 11 percent of those 45-64 and 32 percent of those 65 and up said they had received flu vaccine in the previous 12 months. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> especially recommends flu vaccine for people at increased risk of severe complications from influenza, including older people and those already suffering from certain chronic medical problems such as heart disease. Other surveys have shown that `` only about 20 percent of high-risk individuals get the shot in a typical year,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunn </PERSON>, a CDC flu specialist. In addition to fears about the vaccine, he said, many people `` just do n't know that flu typically kills 20,000 Americans in the average year.'' Adding to the problem, Ms. <PERSON> Sprauer </PERSON> said, is the fact that `` often, health care providers do n't recommend the vaccine. A lot of -LRB- patients -RRB- would be willing to get it if it were offered to them.'' Among the states participating in the health-risk survey, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> had the worst rate of flu vaccination, only 9 percent. <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> was highest at 19 percent. Among older people in particular, percentages ranged from 24 percent in <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> to 41 percent in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. Flu vaccine is believed to be about 90 percent effective in preventing illness in healthy younger people and about 75 percent effective in preventing serious illness or death in high-risk elderly populations, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> reported. The Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> also reported Thursday that the 1988-89 flu season is continuing at serious levels. A key indicator of severe flu activity _ the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>'s tracking of deaths from either pneumonia or flu in selected cities _ was at higher-than-expected levels last week for the fifth week in a row, <PERSON> Gunn </PERSON> said. That indicator now has reached its highest point this winter, `` as bad as anything we've had in the past several years,'' he said. <PERSON> Gunn </PERSON> said the predominant flu strains circulating in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are those known as the <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION> flu, the <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> flu and the <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> flu, all of which are protected against by the recommended 1988-89 flu vaccine.

 Even in good times it's hard for Southerners to trash anything that comes from a hog, hence the presidential snack, pork rinds. `` You do n't throw nothing away,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Nahunta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pork </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. `` You use everything from a hog but the squeal.'' `` It's the finest food substance available on the planet,'' said state Sen. <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Duplin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> hog farmer and one of the largest pork producers in the nation. Hogs provide hams, pork chops, bacon and sausage. Their feet are pickled, the intestines are used as casings for sausage, the tails are used for seasoning and the hide ends up in fancy driving gloves, <ORGANIZATION> Hush </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Puppy </ORGANIZATION> shoes and President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s favorite munchie. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, who produces pork rinds, thinks it's great that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> prefers them with Tabasco sauce. But if the president wants some of <LOCATION> Nahunta </LOCATION>'s home-style skins, he'll have to come to this crossroads 50 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION> to get them. `` It will probably be good for the pork industry, but there's not much way for it to help our business,'' said <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, whose father founded the company 24 years ago. `` We process 100 skins a week and ca n't meet the demand from our customers as it is.'' The pork company, which makes up most of <LOCATION> Nahunta </LOCATION>, started as a slaughterhouse in 1955 and added retail pork sales in 1975. It does not distribute its products, but more than 3,000 people a week come by to pick out fresh pork and cured hams. They also grab up 99-cent bags of <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s salted and deep-fried pork skins. `` We process about 500 hogs a week,'' <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said, `` but we're real particular about the skins we use If they are n't quite up to snuff, we wo n't use them. That's why we only turn about 100 skins a week into pork rinds.'' A special machine slices the skin off of pork pieces. The skin pieces are cooked for four hours in vats to dry out the fat. Then the hard, shriveled skins are deep fried. The pieces of skin swell and pop, turning into puffy slabs of rind in minutes. `` This is our scientific measuring process,'' <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said as he dipped a handful of salt from a bucket and spread it over the fried rinds. `` Ones that come out like this, we throw away,'' he said, plucking a dark, hard chunk from among the beige sheets of fried skin. `` And we've got two grades of rinds. `` The ones that come out really nice and thin are No. Ones,'' he said. `` Your thicker skins that come out a little tougher are No. Twos.'' A bag of No. Ones, which weighs a little more than 3 ounces, and a 12-ounce bag of No. Twos go for the same price _ 99 cents. `` We actually sell more of the No. Twos,'' <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said. `` People seem to like to gnaw on them a little bit.'' A half-ounce serving of pork rinds provides little in the way of nutrition; potato chips and peanuts have more nutrients, but also more fat and cholesterol. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> analysis showed a two-ounce package of rinds contains 315 calories; 32.5 grams of protein; 18.9 grams of fat; 58 milligrams of cholesterol; and 1,054 milligrams of salt. The <ORGANIZATION> Snack </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said pork rind sales nationally totaled $ 195 million in 1987, a figure dwarfed by potato chips, which had $ 3.8 billion in sales the same year. <PERSON> Dwayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pilkington </PERSON>, a professor of food science at <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said the origin of pork rinds is lost in history. `` I do n't know when people started popping skins or why,'' <PERSON> Pilkington </PERSON> said. `` I do n't know if it's a takeoff from the old days of crackling or what.'' Crackling, or cracklin', is hog fat that has the lard squeezed out of it and is then cooked. In some areas, the layer of fat was ground up with the skin to make the crisp treat. `` It could be that somebody had a piece of skin left over from cracklin', put it on a stove and it popped, sort of an accidental discovery,'' <PERSON> Pilkington </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said he is n't sure why pork rinds have remained a regional delicacy, limited mainly to the South. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, who raises a million hogs a year, said other areas of the country have just lagged behind the South in realizing how good pork rinds are. `` Anybody that does n't like them has just never tasted them,'' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, a Democrat, said he was aware of the Republican president's use of symbolism in the 1988 campaign, but he did not believe <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> used pork rinds as a populist snack to fight a less-than-macho image. `` I really think he ate them before the presidential campaign,'' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said. `` But maybe nobody paid much attention to what he ate when he was n't the president. The office sure changes that.''

 Winemaker <PERSON> Serge </PERSON> <PERSON> Hochar </PERSON>, like some of his competitors, likes to sell no wine before its time. But in war-torn <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, it's not always up to him to decide. `` You never know if you'll be hit,'' <PERSON> Hochar </PERSON> said Wednesday, adding that he's missed some vintages when fighting broke out near his Chateau Musar, the best-known of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s five wineries. `` I must say, I have been very lucky,'' said the vintner, whose products are internationally rated among the top wines of the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. `` My home, 200 yards from the fire line between east and west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, has been bombed only three times in the last 14 years, and I managed to escape.'' The Beirut-born winemaker, who is in his 50s, styles his wine for cosmopolitan tastes. He was in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> on Wednesday on a seven-city <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tour to market his wines, which ranged from 1959 to 1980. Despite his unpredictable environment, <PERSON> Hochar </PERSON> says he will not release a vintage if he does n't like it, and he insists on holding his wines in cellars for at least eight years. `` I am not a political man. I am a wine man, and a wine man is a human person because I work with life. I keep my vines and my wines alive,'' he said. Hochar makes 15,000 to 20,000 cases of wine a year at the 30-year-old winery founded by his father, <PERSON> Gaston </PERSON>. The star is his <ORGANIZATION> Bordeaux </ORGANIZATION> red, a blend of cabernet sauvignon, cinsault and syrah. It can take weeks for <LOCATION> Hochar </LOCATION> to get grapes from the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, 40 miles south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, to his winery in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s embattled capital city. `` We have to cross five or six checkpoints, many borders ... sometimes we have to go south from the vineyard and sail back by boat.'' And everywhere, he said, he must pay duty, at each border and to whomever has the power _ or a gun. `` You get used to it after a while,'' he said. `` You do n't realize you are in a war situation You live with it. ...

 Tenor <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Shicoff </PERSON> triumphed in the title role of `` Werther'' on Thursday night as the Metropolitan Opera performed the Massenet opera for the first time this season. In the first scene, when <PERSON> Werther </PERSON> is marveling at a garden, the emotionalism of the <PERSON> Goethe </PERSON> hero was in his voice. Later, <PERSON> Shicoff </PERSON>'s voice shimmered, without any of the Italian sound which would be wrong for this French opera After an exceptionally long second intermission, an announcement was made that <PERSON> Shicoff </PERSON> had been suffering from flu for a week but would continue. This was a surprise, since neither vocal difficulty nor the added resonance that a cold sometimes gives were heard. <PERSON> Shicoff </PERSON>'s final act was as splendid as the two before. He even managed to create sympathy for Werther, longing for <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, who is married. We have n't great patience for Werther's romanticism these days.

 An <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> barge carrying a 1,000-ton nuclear reactor from the nation's first decommissioned commercial nuclear power plant passed this city Thursday on its two-month, 8,100-mile trip to burial at <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION> `` There's a bit of history here,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McKerman </PERSON>, a consultant to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> on the project. `` I like to think of it as the end of the beginning of nuclear power.'' <PERSON> McKernan </PERSON> said the nuclear plant at <LOCATION> Shippingport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, was the first commercial nuclear plant to be commissioned in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the first to be decommissioned.

It is moving along just as it was planned.'' The reactor, which is 35 feet long and 25 feet high and encased in concrete, is being shipped to an Energy Department disposal site for burial, <PERSON> Bauman </PERSON> said. The vessel will take the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, to the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, to the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> north to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state. The journey is expected to take about 60 days, officials said. The reactor parts were packed in concrete before being loaded onto the <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunyan </PERSON> last month, but the trip was delayed because of bad weather, <PERSON> Bauman </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearst </PERSON> could n't have put it clearer. `` Why,'' asked editor <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON>, summing up the philosophy that has guided his magazine for 20 years, `` should I publish something I do n't agree with?'' Nonetheless, to celebrate a survival that was never a sure thing, the March issue of <PERSON> Peters </PERSON>' skinny magazine, the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Monthly, violates his own premise. `` What's Wrong With This Magazine?'' asks the cover. Inside, 11 former editors are allowed to take issue with the boss, one of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s enduring curmudgeons. The result: the reader gets to watch liberalism argue with itself. None of March's contributors quarrels with the Monthly's fundamental liberal philosophy _ one it is no more likely to abandon than Popular Mechanics would question the utility of the basement workbench But, like <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mechanics </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Peters </PERSON>' magazine has been concerned with the way things actually work and why they do n't if they do n't. His view is that they often do n't; his goal is `` to expose and correct the follies of liberalism.'' He calls it neoliberalism. `` We were not trying to move the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to the right,'' recalls former Monthly writer <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemann </PERSON>. `` We were trying to make liberalism even better and stronger than it already was.'' Like scores of other onetime Monthly writers, <PERSON> Lemann </PERSON> moved on to better pay, in his case at the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> paid his editors $ 10,000 a year _ himself $ 24,000 _ but gave them the chance to write and be read in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The magazine has 33,000 subscribers and, after a long struggle, is in the black. <PERSON> Peters </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> legislator and <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> executive, founded it with some help from investors including Sen. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, a fellow former Peace <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, now with <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; World Report, takes the Monthly to task for not coming to grips with the full consequences of its advocacy of a less greedy way of life. `` If we're to be less materialistic ... it means that we'll buy fewer products and there will be less revenue for business. The hard question that neoliberals and others have n't asked is: Can we have more time for families and volunteerism, less materialism, and still have high economic growth? I do n't think so.'' <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> <PERSON> Easterbrook </PERSON>, now a contributing editor of <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION>, accuses the Monthly of harboring an unwholesome suspicion of profits. `` Occasionally companies make big profits via fraud, monopoly or other chicanery,'' he writes. `` Usually they make big profits because they deserve to _ the market is pretty effective in distributing that reward.'' Anyway, asks <PERSON> Easterbrook </PERSON>, what's so bad about the `` service-yuppie-paper economy'' that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is becoming? `` The Monthly often laments that the backbreaking, dangerous, soul-draining jobs in heavy industrial production are being replaced by highly paid white-collar desk jobs. Sounds pretty good to me.'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinsley </PERSON>, now editor of The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, attacks <PERSON> Peters </PERSON>' perennial crusade for a peacetime draft `` Telling people they must give up two years of their lives is a major infringement on freedom,'' <PERSON> Kinsley </PERSON> argues. Moreover, if rich people were drafted into the Army they would push out poor people who are there because they want to be, he says. `` It's no favor to would-be volunteers to shut off this option in order to put others unwillingly in their place.'' <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> gives himself the last word, accepting many of the criticisms but taking issue with others. To <PERSON> Easterbrook </PERSON>, he says that what's wrong with maximizing profits `` is that it encourages corporations to take chances with worker safety, to pollute the air, to attempt to gain monopoly control of markets.'' To <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>'s growth arguments, he says, `` Without economic growth, we wo n't have the tax revenues necessary to clear up the environmental mess that already exists.'' And to <PERSON> Kinsley </PERSON> he says a draft would give <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> at least one social institution where rich and poor could come to know and understand one another. `` Upper-class participation in the military would give people with clout a compelling interest in avoiding war and, in case war turns out to be unavoidable, in being equipped with weapons that work,'' <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> writes. `` Thus a draft of the wealthy would both aid military reformers and enhance the prospect for peace.''

 The jury in <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s Iran-Contra trial had the day off today so the former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide's lawyers could detail complaints that the government is censoring material to hamstring the defense. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> is hearing arguments from <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s attorneys that the Classified Information Procedures Act governing the handling of classified material in criminal trials should not be applied in this case. North is accused of lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the attorney general about the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's secret attempts to aid the Nicaraguan Contras during a period in which <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the rebels was banned. The government has made repeated attempts to censor evidence in the case. The defense said in a court filing that the office of independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> `` has knowingly obstructed the conduct of this trial'' as well as the cross-examination of a witness `` by imposing entirely unnecessary secrecy demands on information already in the public domain.'' Prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> responded: `` Far from manipulating the process to its advantage, the government is trying to declassify the information that is necessary to permit this trial to reach a conclusion.'' The latest fight erupted when <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers discovered that memos the government was trying to censor in court had been made public eight months earlier in a separate legal case. Defense lawyers said they found out Monday night that classified memos written by <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s courier to the Contras, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, had been turned over earlier to the <ORGANIZATION> Christic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, which opposes <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy in Central America. Confronted with that information, the government said it would no longer consider the memos to be classified. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>, however, said he would review his rulings on secrecy in light of the problem. North's lawyers filed a motion to dismiss the indictment on grounds of prosecutorial misconduct, but <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said he was n't looking for `` sanctions'' against anyone He said his primary goal is to see that the trial is conducted properly. On Thursday, two people involved in the Contra supply network testified that <PERSON> North </PERSON> appeared to be the man in charge. <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON>, a Cuban who had done work for the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> North </PERSON> sought to reassure a high Salvadoran air force official that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> supported the Contra resupply effort. <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON> said that at a 1986 meeting in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, the official expressed concern about joining with <PERSON> North </PERSON> and others in assisting the Contras and then possibly being `` left out in the cold'' after a few weeks or months. North, <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON> said, responded that `` Mr. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was totally behind this program and behind helping the Contras and all we needed was more time for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to approve ... aid.'' In another instance, retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Col. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadd </PERSON>, who helped arrange for airplanes to carry supplies to the Contras, described a meeting with <PERSON> North </PERSON> in December 1985 at a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> hotel. <PERSON> Gadd </PERSON> said <PERSON> North </PERSON> turned to another <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> retiree involved in the resupply operation, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, and directed him to `` advance Mr. <PERSON> Gadd </PERSON> $ 150,000'' for parachutes and other items the Contras wanted. <PERSON> Gadd </PERSON> subsequently got $ 100,000. <PERSON> Gadd </PERSON> arranged to provide airplanes for the covert Contra supply operation at a time when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to the Contras was banned by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. North is accused of 12 crimes, including five counts that he made false statements and obstructed <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 and 1986 by denying any involvement in the Contra resupply operation.

 As glasnost and perestroika unfold in <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, British spy novelists are looking beyond the Evil Empire rhetoric to a more complicated approach that blurs enemy lines. `` What we've lost is the natural assumption that if you say Russians, you're talking about a certain character,'' says <PERSON> Gavin </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyall </PERSON>, creator of the popular cloak-and-dagger character <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxim </PERSON>. `` You ca n't be as simplistic anymore; you move in a direction of possibly more subtlety,'' said <PERSON> Lyall </PERSON>, 57. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Sampson </PERSON> remarked in The Independent newspaper recently that `` those beloved villains -LRB- the Soviets -RRB- are losing their villainy.'' `` They've all been undermined by that exasperatingly soft-spoken <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, as he insists on retreating from every filmic battleground from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>.'' Comments Sunday Times TV critic <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoddart </PERSON>: `` If we are no longer to be scared of Reds under the bed, what on earth are we going to read before we turn out the light?'' The drawing power of Cold War drama remains strong, however, as shown by `` Game, Set and Match,'' a 13-part television adaptation of spy novelist <PERSON> Len </PERSON> <PERSON> Deighton </PERSON>'s trilogy. Aired in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> last fall, it won critical acclaim and high ratings. The <PERSON> Deighton </PERSON> trilogy, about a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> intelligence agent whose wife turns out to be a Soviet plant, was written before glasnost became a household word. But in interviews on the TV set, co-director <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Lau </PERSON> insisted the work was glasnost-inspired in that `` the enemy is no longer drawn in broadstroke cartoon characters.'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, publishing director of Century-Hutchinson books and former editor of famed spy novelist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Carre </PERSON>, said: `` Writers are having to be a bit more sophisticated.

 The National Zoo celebrated its 100th birthday this week with <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> leading the noisy hoopla, but over at the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Insect </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoo </ORGANIZATION>, things were so quiet you could actually hear the giant <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION> hissing cockroach hiss. The silence was broken by shrieks and gasps from a class of first-graders who gathered round to watch <PERSON> Cleo </PERSON>, the orange-kneed Mexican tarantula, gobble her weekly meal of a live cricket. If you blinked, you'd miss the show. Might these spiders be desperately hungry on such a spartan diet? `` Tarantulas do n't burn a lot of calories,'' said <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Love </PERSON>, the Insect Zoo's director. `` They just sit around, waiting for something to bump into them. They can go for a year and a half without eating anything at all.'' Miss Love is plainly in love with bugs. A <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> graduate with a degree in biology, she postponed plans to get a master's degree and quit her job as a `` grunt'' on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> seven years ago to run the tiny Insect Zoo at the dead-end of a third-floor hallway in the National Museum of Natural History. `` Insects are gaining momentum in popularity for some reason,'' said Miss Love, who has appeared on the <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> television shows as well as West German and Canadian TV to display the biggest, showiest specimens from her zoo. `` Everybody has a horror and a fascination with insects,'' she said. `` But when people try to take a close look at insects, they say ` hmmm, they're not so bad after all.' In fact, they are really very interesting.'' Among the dramatic bugs she has chosen for her TV appearances _ she calls them the `` Oh, my's'' because of the audience reaction _ are some of the zoo's 50 or so tarantulas, a whip scorpion from <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, the Giant Walking Stick from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION>, three-inch cockroaches, rare leaf insects from <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> -LRB- whose disguise is to look like the leaves they are devouring -RRB- and scarab beetles and and cone-headed katydids from <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>. To the delight of school children on field trips to the zoo, Miss Love consents to stare cross-eyed as a giant <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION> hissing cockroach crawls up the side of her nose. `` For this I went to school?'' she says with a giggle. Miss Love receives $ 20 a week to spend on fresh fruits and vegetables for her bugs. Most eat things like romaine lettuce and bananas, but the large milkweed bug prefers sunflower seeds and raw peanuts. The meat eaters _ tarantulas, scorpions, centipedes and the like _ eat crickets, with an occasional caterpillar or beetle larvae tossed in for a treat. The tobacco hornworms, of course, like tobacco. And the giant coconut crabs from the <LOCATION> Seychelles </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> ca n't get enough of coconut cake, with vitamin-rich fish food sprinkled on top. Miss Love's two staff assistants are augmented by 50 or 60 unpaid volunteers like <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemmill </PERSON>, 71, retired former managing editor and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> bureau chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gemmill </PERSON> says he comes in every Thursday to conduct `` a little horror show for the kiddies.'' He drops a cricket into the tarantula sandbox and describes ever-so-gently how the spider sucks the `` cricket soup'' from its prey the same way Count Dracula sank his fangs into beautiful maidens. He also informs his young listeners that `` it does n't seem entirely fair to me, but in the world of bugs the female has achieved not only equality but a pretty clear superiority.'' Female spiders grow bigger and live much longer than males, <PERSON> Gemmill </PERSON> said, `` and some even eat their husbands.'' To which a young boy in the crowd responded: `` That's the way it goes.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: NATO And Warsaw Pact Having Another Go At Arms
Reductions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>An AP News Analysis</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact head into new arms control talks, the gulf between the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet approaches is so wide it makes prospects for a quick settlement uncertain. The Western allies, under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> leadership, want sharp reductions on the Eastern side. The idea is to force the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact down to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> levels and then cut a little bit more on both sides, by 5 percent to 10 percent. The Soviets, meanwhile, have adopted a more dramatic and radical stance on arms control under President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. They are likely to insist on far deeper cuts in non-nuclear forces on both sides, and across a wider range of weapons. The two sides are starting over after 15 years of futile negotiations to reduce non-nuclear forces in Central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. They have broadened their vistas to cover the entire expanse of the continent _ from the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Ural </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. All 35 nations that signed the 1975 <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> agreement to reduce East-West tensions are involved, but the negotiations will be conducted by the 16-nation <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and the 7-nation <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION>. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> is going to <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> on Saturday night to kick off the talks, although he will be back home again before the actual opening on Thursday. He will have a chance to compare notes with the other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers, and to hold a get-acquainted session with Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. They are likely to agree on a date and an agenda for <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> to make his first trip to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, in late April or early May. The overall improvement in U.S.-Soviet relations is bound to have a salutary effect on the negotiations. On the other hand, the opening <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> position would make far deeper cuts in the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact forces than in the Western alliance and leaves out missiles and airplanes. Assuming the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact went along, the levels of tanks, anti-aircraft artillery and armored personnel carriers on the two sides would be only marginally below current <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> strength. <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiator, suggested in a report Thursday for the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Concerned </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scientists </ORGANIZATION> that the proposal does not go far enough to achieve real cuts in the $ 300 billion <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> spends annually on the defense of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` The Pact seems ready for deep cuts, but it wants to see <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> cut, too,'' <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> said. `` <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s position would not decisively achieve stability to reduce the possibility of conflict between the alliances.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>, research director of the private <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said that `` not only does the Western approach appear to be one-sided, but the complexity of the negotiations seems daunting.'' <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>, in an interview, said the outcome will depend on whether the desire of both East and West to reduce their defense burdens is strong enough `` to enable political leaders to cut through these inherent technical complexities and differing approaches.'' If an agreement is ultimately reached, <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said, it is likely to be based on a trade-off of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s advantages in quality aircraft for the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact's overwhelming numerical edge in ground-based tanks and equipment. In the meantime, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> offered last fall to withdraw six tank divisions from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and to reduce Soviet manpower in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. In January, he announced a 14.2 percent reduction in the defense budget and a 19.5 percent cutback in weapons and military hardware. Soviet Ambassador <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON> said at a news conference Thursday that the troop reductions were unilateral and irreversible. However, the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> proposal would require a 50 percent reduction in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact tanks. <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON> was not willing to take up that challenge. He said the Soviets had the impression `` the real <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> approach'' to reducing non-nuclear forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> was still being formulated by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. `` It would be risky now to discuss it,'' the Soviet diplomat said.

He told congressional officials he would seek to renew the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> `` humanitarian'' aid, which runs out at the end of this month, for a year, according to some present at the meetings. Aid would continue to flow at current rates _ about $ 4 million a month _ and would keep the rebels available as a standby fighting force until after <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s national elections, which are being moved up to early 1990. But some participants said it was clear that the one-year extension would be objectionable to congressional Democrats who oppose the Contra policy, and that it might be negotiable. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s top objective for <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> remains to achieve a bipartisan consensus on how to achieve democracy and peace in the region, the participants said `` They're trying to put something together that everybody can agree on, that both Democrats and Republicans can support,'' said Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Maine </LOCATION>, who attended one meeting in the office of Senate Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan. At the same time <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> was making the rounds, Guatemalan President <PERSON> Vinicio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerezo </PERSON> also was calling on some of the same congressional leaders to ask stronger <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for last month's regional peace agreement reached in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> among the five Central American The pact calls for drafting a plan by mid-May that would disband the 11,000-man Contra force and provide for them to be assimilated into <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> as the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> open up and democratize their political process, free political prisoners and hold new elections. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been cool to the plan, saying it is similar to past Sandinista promises which have not been kept and contains no enforcement mechanism to make sure the reforms are achieved. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> reiterated his skepticism to <ORGANIZATION> Cerezo </ORGANIZATION> in a meeting on Thursday, said <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. But House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should support the plan and seek to propel it forward. `` We ought to be positive and supportive, and not pour cold water on it,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said before a meeting with <ORGANIZATION> Cerezo </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, in a statement that seemed to fit in with <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s proposal, added: `` We have some leverage we can apply at the proper moment to reinforce the agreement and help make it work. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said that leverage could include lifting the current <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade embargo on <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Sources in the administration and on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, all speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> was considering lifting that embargo as well as offering small economic incentives to help <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s failing economy if the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> live up to their pledges of democratization. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> is also considering a range of possible <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> actions that could include resumption of normalized relations on visas, air travel, foreign aid and exchange of diplomats, said one administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity. While current aid to the Contras officially runs out March 31, supplies that have been bought by that date could continue to flow to the rebels and keep them supplied at least through April, congressional sources said. While the adinistration may propose its new aid package before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leaves town March 23 for a 10-day Easter break, it is unlikely action will come before April. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s discussions on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> were seen in part as an effort to get moving on <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> amid accusations that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been slow to get his foreign policy machinery off the ground. The administration apparently was taken by surprise by the agreement reached Feb. 14 by the five presidents in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sol </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, and is scrambling to catch up. The five countries are <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. `` Part of what's driving them -LRB- the Central American presidents -RRB- is our own policy vacuum,'' said an administration source who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` They had no idea what our policy was when they met.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s discussions with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> were `` to get us out of this vacuum,'' the source said. Some congressional critics noted as well that the policy proposals apparently had not yet been cleared with the Contras or the Central American presidents. `` This is a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> plan, not a Central American plan,'' said one Republican source.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision on whether to intervene in the threatened <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> strike will show whether he wants to improve relations with organized labor, a union president says. <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Sombrotto </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Letter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carriers </ORGANIZATION>, said that if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appoints an emergency investigative board and delays the strike by 60 days, `` that would show a recognition of American labor as an institution.'' But if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> refuses to invoke the law, <PERSON> Sombrotto </PERSON> said, `` that would just be consistent with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's laissez-faire attitude. Former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> responded to his first labor-management crisis in August 1981 by firing some 11,400 striking air traffic controllers, and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s relations with organized labor suffered throughout two terms. Now, the specter of a strike at 12:01 a.m. EST Saturday has forced <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to decide whether he wants to invoke provisions of the Railway Labor Act to impose a 60-day cooling off period. <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON>, who headed the now-defunct <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> and was chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wage </ORGANIZATION> and Price Stability during the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration, said it would be a mistake to intervene. But <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, an analyst with the private <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said she doubted that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision either way would make a major statement about his intentions toward labor. `` I do n't think the controllers strike changed the course of history of labor-management relations,'' she said, `` and I do n't think that whatever Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will do will change the course of labor relations. At midnight, the end of a 30-day cooling-off period set by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> can impose work conditions and the union can strike. The board recommended that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> name the emergency panel. <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON>, who was instrumental in the late 1970s move to ease government regulation of the airline industry and increase competition, said, `` I think that if the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration succumbs, and appoints this board ... it would be tipping the scales in favor of labor. It would be such a labor-dictated intervention it could be seen as killing Eastern.'' <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON>, in a telephone interview from the campus of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said `` the more they -LRB- the unions -RRB- can delay either a strike or the probability of a settlement, the more they can increase the chances of Eastern going under.'' <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON>, special counsel to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, said the union movement is `` going to unduly pressure the new administration ... by raising the stakes'' in situations such as the Eastern dispute. `` It's a fairly dangerous gambit, forcing this into an early bellwether of where the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is going to go'' in the area of labor-relations, he said. `` Government intervention was not a hallmark of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. `` If he -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB- makes the decision to intervene, it will be a reluctant one,'' de <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sombrotto </PERSON> acknowledged that `` it's a little unusual'' for organized labor to urge government intervention to stop a strike _ which is the ultimate weapon of unionized workers. But he said that `` it is a little different period.'' He said a strike would be detrimental to `` the flying public'' and to the economy, as well as to the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> employees. In contrast to earlier years, when the organized labor movement was much stronger, the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> has urged <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to use this law to delay a strike. In days past, government intervention to stop a strike would have infuriated labor leaders. At the same time, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, the chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, has warned that putting off planned cuts in costs could send the carrier to `` the corporate graveyard.''

 A <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> senior faces a contempt of court charge for enclosing a letter with a parking fine in which he complained in mostly vulgar terms about having to pay. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Sebastian </PERSON>, 23, said he was angry about the fine because he received the parking ticket while taking a required exam. He suggested, in a letter peppered mostly with profanities, that the city should coordinate parking with the school when exams are scheduled. `` The emotion did slip,'' <PERSON> Sebastian </PERSON> said about the letter, which he claims is an expression of constitutionally protected free speech. `` But that does n't change the feelings that I felt.'' After Municipal Judge <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Bocci </PERSON> read the letter, he ordered <PERSON> Sebastian </PERSON> to show cause why he should n't be held in contempt `` for disorderly, contemptuous or insolent behavior toward the judge and court.'' Now <PERSON> Sebastian </PERSON> faces the prospect of a $ 25 fine or 10 days in jail. `` I felt it was offensive to the proper judicial operation of the court and to what's referred to as the dignity of the court,'' <PERSON> Bocci </PERSON> said this week. He added that it was the first time in 24 years on the bench that he's issued a contempt citation against someone for writing a letter. The case was heard this week by Pro Tem Judge <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Spickerman </PERSON> after <PERSON> Bocci </PERSON> disqualified himself from the case to avoid any bias. <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Prozanski </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a city prosecutor, admitted there were no <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> cases dealing with the issue but he cited cases in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> that appeared to offer some guidance. However, defense attorney <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Chez </PERSON> cited another <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> case that concluded with a pair of rhyming couplets: `` Statutory attempts to regulate pure bluster, Ca n't pass what is called constitutional muster.

<TEXT>
 Poet Laureate <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nemerov </PERSON> says writing a poem about <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was `` a real hard test,'' but he thinks the 28 lines he penned to help the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> observe their 200th anniversary served the purpose. <PERSON> Nemerov </PERSON> read his poem at a joint meeting of the two Houses Thursday _ held early because the bicentennial of March 4, 1789, when the first <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> met in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, will fall on a Saturday when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is not in session. `` I think the historian of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was the one who transmitted the invitation, and I said, ` Well, what the hell, have a go, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>,''' said the poet. `` I'm not a romantic poet, but I do n't mind trying to do a decent job of whatever comes up, and if I ca n't do it, I wo n't,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> historian, <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Smock </PERSON>, said he asked <PERSON> Nemerov </PERSON> about three weeks ago if he would write the poem. `` I simply called him up and told him we would like to have this happen, and he was delighted,'' he said. `` You could see that already the wheels were turning and he was thinking about <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and saw it, I think, as a challenge.'' <PERSON> Nemerov </PERSON> said it was n't any cinch turning out a poem about <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in three weeks. `` It cost a lot of blood and sweat to do it,'' he said. `` If there were time, I would have told the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, ` I was brought up to believe that no subject was intrinsically unpoetical, but you ladies and gents gave me a real hard test.' However, I think I done all right.'' <PERSON> Smock </PERSON> said the lawmakers `` thought it was just the right touch.'' <PERSON> Nemerov </PERSON>'s poem, entitled `` To the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> Entering its Third Century,'' ends with the lines: `` So it's a republic, as <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> said, `` If you can keep it; and we did `` This far, and hope to keep our quarrel `` Funny and just, though with this moral: `` Praise without end for the go-ahead zeal `` Of whoever it was invented the wheel; `` But never a word for the poor soul's sake `` That thought ahead, and invented the brake.'' <PERSON> Nemerov </PERSON> is the third person to serve as poet laureate, following <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilbur </PERSON>, under a 1986 law adding that title to the 50-year-old position of consultant in poetry to the Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The law includes a clause that provides, `` Each department and office of the federal government is encouraged to make use of the services of the poet laureate for ceremonial and other occasions of celebration.'' Poets took exception when the law was written. `` I can see all sorts of terrible things possibly happening,'' <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunitz </PERSON>, the 1979 winner of the Pulitzer Prize for poetry, said at a conference at <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` Relations between politics and poetry have been almost always destructive to poetry,'' added <PERSON> Josephine </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON>, like <PERSON> Kunitz </PERSON> a former Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> poetry consultant. But <PERSON> Nemerov </PERSON> says he never heard of such a provision. <PERSON> Smock </PERSON> said he and other Bicentennial planners knew what the law said, but that was n't why they decided to ask <PERSON> Nemerov </PERSON> if he would write a poem. `` It was more a feeling that this occasion called for a poetic expression,'' said <PERSON> Smock </PERSON>. `` I do n't know what's happened to poetry,'' <PERSON> Smock </PERSON> said. `` It seems to have retreated to our universities, and its not something that's done publicly like it used to be. We thought it would be delightful to afford the poet laureate an opportunity if he was willing.''

 Here is the poem that Poet Laureate <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nemerov </PERSON> read at Thursday's joint meeting of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to mark its Bicentennial: To The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> Entering its Third Century Because reverence has never been <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s thing, This verse in your honor will not begin ` O thou.' But the great respect our country has to give May you all continue to deserve, and have. Here at the fulcrum of us all, The feather of truth against the soul Is weighed, and had better be found to balance Lest our enterprise collapse in silence. For here the million varying wills Get melted down, get hammered out Until the movie's reduced to stills That tell us what the law's about. Conflict's endemic in the mind: Your job's to hear it in the wind And compass it in opposites, And bring the antagonists by your wits To being one, and that the law Thenceforth, until you change your minds Against and with the shifting winds That this and that way blow the straw. So it's a republic, as <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> said, If you can keep it; and we did Thus far, and hope to keep our quarrel Funny and just, though with this moral: Praise without end for the go-ahead zeal Of whoever it was invented the wheel; But never a word for the poor soul's sake That thought ahead, and invented the brake. _ <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nemerov </PERSON>

<HEAD>Budget Crunch Threatens to Pull Plug on Satellites</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The future looks cloudy for the Landsat satellites that keep on eye on the earth and its climate, with shutdown likely by the end of the month unless more money can be found. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> only provided enough money to run the system through the end of March and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> does n't have any extra funds to keep them going, <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION> satellite director <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pyke </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, said Thursday. As a result, the contractor that runs the satellites for the government has been directed to begin shutting them down, <PERSON> Pyke </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. A Landsat satellite scheduled for launch in 1991 is not affected. But Sen. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Tenn., blamed the decision on the administration and called the funding halt `` one of the most ridiculous policy decisions I have seen in 13 years of service in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` At a time when we are trying to get more information about environmental change, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is shutting down one of our best sources of information,'' said <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on Science, Technology and Space. All Landsat services, including access to more than 2 million archive images of the planet, will cease March 15, the <ORGANIZATION> Earth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Satellite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- EOSAT -RRB- announced. `` If this is carried to completion, near the end of this month they will actually pull the switch on these two satellites and place them on internal control,'' <PERSON> Pyke </PERSON> said. `` Once that has been done it may not be possible to reestablish communications with these satellites.'' In the meantime, however, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has called a hearing for next Tuesday to look into ways of saving the satellite system. `` It makes absolutely no sense'' to shut down the satellites, said Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., a committee member He called on President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to intercede immediately by asking the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and the departments of <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> and Agriculture to help fund the program. EOSAT Vice President <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Norris </PERSON> termed the threatened shutdown `` beyond belief.'' `` The Landsat program provides important environmental data that touches on projects throughout the world,'' <PERSON> Norris </PERSON> said. But, explained <PERSON> Pyke </PERSON>: `` We have gone to the other federal agencies who make use of Landsat data and asked them if they can help with the continued funding of Landsat operations, but as of today we have received no additional funds from any source.'' Currently, EOSAT operates two satellites, <ORGANIZATION> Landsats </ORGANIZATION> 4 and 5, which provide photos used for a variety of purposes including mineral exploration, checking soil conditions and vegetation, urban and rural planning, monitoring volcanoes, tracing ocean currents and so forth. Both satellites are well past their expected lifetimes and are not fully operational, <PERSON> Pyke </PERSON> noted, but they are still providing useful information. An improved satellite, Landsat 6, is under construction, <PERSON> Pyke </PERSON> added. That project will continue because funds were provided to complete and launch that satellite, which is expected to go into service in 1991. EOSAT was established to take over Landsat operations in 1985 after the <ORGANIZATION> Reagan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> sought to sell both Landsat and the nation's weather satellites to commercial operators. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> refused to approve sale of the weather satellites, but permitted the Landsat sale, with federal support to be phased out over five years. EOSAT has struggled financially in recent years, facing strong competition from the French SPOT-Image satellite system and also the possibility of civilian sales of satellite images by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The cost to taxpayers of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s savings and loan plan could jump by more than a third if the administration's economic assumptions turn out to be too optimistic, the White House budget director says <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>, acknowledged on Thursday that economic projections showing interest rates declining by 5 percentage points over the next five years are optimistic But the administration's plan to close and sell off insolvent savings institutions has a $ 10 billion to $ 15 billion `` fudge factor'' that should accommodate any increase in costs caused by higher interest rates, he told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said if interest rates stay on average 2 percentage points above what the administration projects, budget outlays for the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L plan from 1989 through 1999 would rise from $ 39.9 billion to $ 50.6 billion. And if deposits at S & amp; Ls grow at a 4 percent annual rate instead of the 7 percent forecast, budget outlays would swell by another $ 4.7 billion to make up for a lower level of deposit insurance premiums, he said. <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> vigorously defended <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal to borrow <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L rescue money in a way that keeps $ 50 billion in spending out of the budget deficit. <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said adding $ 50 billion to the deficit would risk a larger crisis while <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the administration tried to agree on how to meet the targets of the Gramm-Rudman law. `` I think it could well bring the political system to stalemate,'' he said. `` The net effect of that would be to drive interest rates up higher -LRB- and -RRB- force us into recession.'' In other S & amp; L developments: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> took control of 37 more insolvent S & amp; Ls, bringing the total under its supervision to 73 The 37 were in six states: 12 in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, 10 in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, eight in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, four in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, two in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and one in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. Although the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> regulates commercial banks, it is taking over the 220 worst-off S & amp; Ls in preparation for the regulatory reorganization proposed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. _ Former Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, backed a liberal coalition's proposal to require financial institutions to commit money to low-and moderate-income housing as a concession for an S & amp; L bailout The coalition would finance its proposal by boosting the top federal income tax rate from 33 percent to 38 percent and by making assessments on brokerage firms and mutual funds, as well as banks and S & amp; Ls. _ Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> won the support of a major banking group for the <ORGANIZATION> administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L plan The board of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> voted unanimously to work for the plan even though it would nearly double deposit insurance premiums paid by banks. The <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION>'s support was conditioned on the eventual granting of partial premium rebates and on capping the premium at 15 cents per $ 100 of deposits. The administration proposal would permit regulators, if necessary, to raise the premium as high as 35 cents. _ The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' investigative agency, told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel that `` junk bonds'' have been a profitable investment for <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls, but warned that their safety has n't been tested during an economic downturn The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee that the nation's <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls, had invested about $ 13 billion in junk bonds as of Sept. 30 The bonds pay higher interest but carry a greater risk of default. On another point, <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said the administration is forecasting that 200 of the nation's 2,950 <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls will fail because they will be unable to meet stricter capital standards requiring <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L owners to put up more of their own money within two years. That's in addition to the 350 that have already failed and are awaiting closure.

<HEAD>Fed Chief Says Money Moves Have Kept Inflation at Bay</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> insists that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s anti-inflation moves have been proper despite criticism that its tight-money policy could topple the country into a recession,. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday that he did not believe forcing the country into a recession was a proper way to fight inflation and he said that was not the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s intention. But he said if the central bank had not been pursuing a policy of gradually pushing up interest rates since March of last year, inflationary pressures would be much more severe at the current time. If inflation gets out of control, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is forced to squeeze credit much tighter, driving interest rates even higher and making any economic downturn much more severe. That is what occurred in 1981-82, when the country suffered through the most drastic recession since the Great Depression, as then-Fed Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON> drove interest rates higher and higher to combat the worst bout of inflation since the Civil War. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> indicated that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s current course was aimed at making sure that the next recession will not have to be as severe. `` I do believe that the business cycle has not been repealed,'' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said. `` We will at some point get a recession, but I hope that we have correct policies in place so the recession will be mild.'' <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, D-Calif., noted that there was a difference of opinion on the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s credit-tightening moves, which included a decision last Friday to boost to 7 percent the discount rate, the interest the central bank charges to make loans to financial institutions `` Opinion seems divided whether this move was ` too little, too late' or ` too much, too soon,' `` <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON> said that regardless of whether the higher interest rates end up pushing the country into a recession, the credit tightening will have many adverse consequences, including a bigger budget deficit, more troubles for the savings and loan industry, higher debt payments by Third World countries and higher costs to consumers who borrow to purchase homes and autos. But <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said the central bank remained convinced that the dangers of doing nothing outweighed risks to specific sectors of the economy from higher interest rates. On another matter, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said he still supported increasing the federal gasoline tax but only as a conservation measure, not as a way of boosting federal revenues. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> also said that boosting taxes on alcoholic beverages and cigarettes would not harm the economy, but he said simply increasing federal tax revenues was not the answer the government's imbalance between spending and revenues Echoing a position taken by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said that higher federal revenues were much more likely to end up funding new programs rather than being used to reduce the budget deficit. `` There is a tendency in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, when revenues are available, to increase government programs,'' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said he would prefer across-the-board spending cuts to tax increases if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the administration fail to agree on a plan to reduce the 1990 budget deficit to $ 100 billion. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> repeated warnings that he has made in earlier congressional appearances that it is crucial that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the new administration reach agreement on a credible, multi-year plan to reduce the budget deficit. He said there was `` no question'' that such a deficit-reduction program would encourage financial investors and allow long-term interest rates to fall substantially.

<HEAD>Head of SSI Defends Current Benefits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL PAGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The director of a federal program that provides a thin financial cushion to the elderly and the infirm opposes congressional moves to expand the eligibility rolls. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Carozza </PERSON>, deputy commissioner of the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, told a joint hearing of two House committees on Thursday that the current program works. `` I do n't think it would particularly help this problem,'' <PERSON> Carozza </PERSON> told Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Downey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, when asked about a bill in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to ease restrictions to benefits under the Supplemental Security Assistance program. `` SSI is an effective safety net, providing the aged, blind, and disabled with a floor of income, the value of which is enhanced when combined with Medicaid, food stamps and other assistance,'' <PERSON> Carozza </PERSON> said. He shared a witness table with social workers and a 97-year-old <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> woman who lives on $ 13 a day in SSI benefits who also testified before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Aging and the Ways and Means human resources subcommittee. Created in 1972, SSI is operated by the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> as a supplement for those who get federal benefits such as food stamps and Medicare but have little or no other income to live on. Some 4 -LCB- million people received $ 10.7 billion in benefits last year, according to the <ORGANIZATION> SSA </ORGANIZATION>. Parents of severely disabled children are eligible under some circumstances, although 45 percent of the recipients are over 65. But Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsui </PERSON>, D-Calif., called the program `` a failed guarantee against poverty. `` Although the program's concept and structure are basically sound, the current level of federal assistance does not provide recipients with an income that even brings them up to the poverty line,'' said <PERSON> Matsui </PERSON>. And Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Roybal </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Aging, said <ORGANIZATION> SSI </ORGANIZATION> `` is in fact characterized by inadequate benefit levels, large gaps in service, insufficient outreach activities and overly rigid eligibility requirements. He and social workers cited numerous stories of recipients going two years or more without benefits, and then barely able to live on the $ 368 maximum monthly benefit. `` This is less than 75 percent of the poverty level,'' said <PERSON> Roybal </PERSON>. <PERSON> Carozza </PERSON> said, however, `` I believe this is appropriate when you consider that SSI intends to be an income of last resort.''

<HEAD>Common Market Agrees To Chlorfluorocarbon Ban</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Common Market has agreed to cut its use of chlorofluorocarbons, the synthetic compounds that destroy the Earth's ozone layer, by 85 percent and seek a total ban on its production by the end of the century. Chlorofluorocarbons, invented in 1930, are used in aerosol sprays, refrigeration coolants, cleaning agents and several other products. The compounds are blamed for depletion of the ozone layer that protects the Earth from the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays and for an increase in skin cancer. Environmental officials meeting in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> agreed Thursday to give the 12 <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> member nations a mandate to completely phase out the manufacture and use of the compounds by the year 2000. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> urged President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to support the chlorofluorocarbon phase-out by the end of the century. But his proposal was not immediately endorsed by the administration, the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> member states are responsible for about half the world's annual chlorofluorocarbon production of 1 million tons, with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> leading in both production and exports, according to the London-based environmental group <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> The commission will represent the 12 nations at international conferences being held this year to discuss the ozone issue and to monitor application of an international accord called the Montreal Protocol. This protocol, signed by 40 countries and ratified by 32, took effect Jan. 1 and is intended to reduce the production and use of chlorofluorocarbons by 50 percent from current levels by 1998. On Sunday, scientists, industrialists and government officials from around the world will gather in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to discuss how to eliminate chlorofluorocarbons, which also are blamed for damaging crops and forests by depleting the protective ozone shield. British Environment Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridley </PERSON> said more than 110 countries have accepted <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s invitation to attend the three-day conference, entitled `` Saving the Ozone Layer.'' Several countries, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, have banned use of the compounds in aerosol propellants, and Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said Thursday that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> will soon require all new refrigerators to contain substances that will not harm the ozone layer. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> will lobby other nations to do the same, <PERSON> Ridley </PERSON> said. He said emphasis will be placed on developing countries such as <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which are beginning mass production of refrigerators and other consumer goods containing the compounds. <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> says <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> exported chlorofluorocarbons to 117 countries in 1988, 81 of which had not signed the Montreal Protocol. Thirty-one countries have agreed to reduce their emissions by 50 percent by the end of the century. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> already has vowed to cut its emissions in half by the end of this year and to reduce total emissions by 85 percent by 1999. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, a government official said today that the government has urged domestic companies to reduce their dependency on chlorfluorocarbons, or CFCs, before regulations restricting their use become mandatory. Beginning in July, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> will regulate the production and import of CFCs in compliance with the <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> Protocol. Chlorofluorocarbons and related chemicals known as halons, which are used in firefighting equipment, can last 100 years. They are stable and non-toxic at lower levels but when they reach the stratosphere, 15-25 miles up, they are broken up by ultraviolet radiation and their chlorine atoms destroy the ozone. Over the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION>, an ozone hole _ an area where ozone has been seriously depleted _ is worsening, according to the British government's <ORGANIZATION> Stratospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ozone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. The group reported that ozone concentration in the winter was reduced by 95 percent in some parts. An international expedition warned in February that the atmosphere over the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> region is also primed for a large destruction of ozone. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> reported last year that annual ozone depletion over the <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hemisphere </ORGANIZATION>'s mid-latitudes is much higher than thought The protective shield appears to have shrunk by 2.3 percent since 1969 over the area, which includes most of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said. Scientists say a thinning of the ozone layer increases the incidence of skin cancer. According to <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION>, each 1 percent depletion is estimated to increase incidence of skin cancer by about 4 percent. The <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> conference, to be opened by Kenyan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> arap </PERSON> <PERSON> Moi </PERSON>, will be addressed first by scientists studying ozone depletion, then from industrialists developing safe alternatives for some compounds. Another conference is scheduled in <LOCATION> Helskinki </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, on May 2-5 to monitor application of the <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> protocol.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> will become the first secretary of veterans affairs after a key senator said the former lawmaker could probably `` rise above'' a dangerous breach of confidentiality he committed 12 years ago. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 94-0 on Thursday to confirm <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON>, whose new Veterans Affairs Department will be the government's largest department second only to the Pentagon. <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> will be head of the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> until it becomes a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> department on March 15.

<HEAD>Bush Could Make or Break Public Election Fund in 1992</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD L. VERNACI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> could keep the federal campaign fund afloat if he decides to run for re-election, but the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> may fall $ 72 million short when it is to pay for the 1996 presidential contest, a congressional panel was told. The fund that pays for the presidential campaigns is facing a shortfall because fewer people are marking the box on their income tax returns that would put $ 1 of their taxes into the kitty, members of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s presence in the 1992 campaign could be counted upon to keep other Republicans from running, thus reducing the amount of money the federal government would have to pay, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON>, vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations subcommittee. `` But if anything would happen so that it would be an open race, as it was last time, there would be a shortfall,'' she said. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s luck probably will run out in 1996, when a crowded field of candidates in both parties can be expected to run for an open seat in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> _ as was the case last year. `` We predict that there will be a $ 72 million shortfall'' in 1996, she said. Last year, when there were more than a dozen candidates seeking the Democratic and Republican presidential nominations, the federal government spent some $ 176 million to cover the campaigns for the primaries and general election, as well as paying for the parties' national conventions About $ 54 million was left over, but while that sounds like a lot, it was the smallest carryover in more than a decade, said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Eiland </PERSON>, a spokesman for the commission. The commission, which was presenting its fiscal 1990 budget request to the committee, asked for $ 250,000 to start an education campaign, largely through public service announcements and advertising, to remind people to check the box on their federal income tax returns to put $ 1 of their taxes into the presidential campaign fund. Under federal law, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> is to pay for the costs of the general election campaigns for president, the costs of the major parties' national conventions, and to provide matching funds in the primaries to presidential candidates who reach a certain level of voter support and fund-raising ability. The first to feel the pinch would be presidential candidates running in the primaries, <PERSON> Eiland </PERSON> said. While the law requires specific amounts to be spent on the general election and the conventions, there is flexibility in how much would be spent on the primary campaigns. Historically presidential campaigns rely heavily on an infusion of cash from the federal government during the primary campaigns because that is when the field of candidates is most crowded and political contributors are most divided. Since 1980, however, contributions to the presidential campaign fund have declined as fewer people marked the box on their tax forms. In 1981, the high-water mark for the fund, 28.7 percent of the 1980 income tax returns used the checkoff, putting $ 41 million into the campaign fund, <PERSON> Eiland </PERSON> said. Participation dropped to 27 percent a year later, giving $ 39 million to the fund. By last year, participation had fallen to 21 percent with $ 33 million going into the presidential campaign fund, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> set up the fund in 1972, and the 1976 presidential election was the first to be financed with public money.

<HEAD>Holes In Cows For Feed Test Prompts Protests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Swedish research project in which two cows had holes sliced in their stomachs to test different types of food has prompted protests by animal rights activists. Swedish papers Thursday published pictures of one of the cows, <PERSON> Norma </PERSON>, with a hole into her flank that was large enough for a man to put in his arm and insert a plastic feed bag into her stomach. The study at <ORGANIZATION> Skara </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterinary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> was to determine whether cows could convert as much nourishment from domestic feed as from imported grains. The feed bags, similar to tea bags, are inserted and withdrawn several times a day. In between, the holes are closed with plastic plugs. The study involves 40 cows, half fed Swedish-grown foodstuffs and the rest on imported grains. The Animal Protection Board in <LOCATION> Goteborg </LOCATION> expressed dismay at the project, and the research farm reportedly was flooded with letters from offended citizens. `` I can understand if many people react negatively to this. But I can guarantee that the cows are not adversely affected by the hole,'' <PERSON> Bo </PERSON> <PERSON> Pehrsson </PERSON>, the veterinarian leading the project, was quoted as saying. He said farmers could save up to $ 158 per cow annually if domestic feed replaces imported grains.

 The new push of science into agriculture through biotechnology is raising questions about the kind of farming that may result, says <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassebrook </PERSON> of the Center for Rural Affairs. So new is the practice of genetic engineering, cloning, embryo transfer and other scientific feats that <PERSON> Hassebrook </PERSON> and others at the center fear there has n't been enough attention paid to the basic research agenda involving biotechnology. A new report, `` Choices for the Heartland: Alternative Directions in Biotechnology and Implications for <LOCATION> Rural </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' written by <PERSON> Hassebrook </PERSON> and colleague <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hegyes </PERSON> has been issued by the center, based in <LOCATION> Walthill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb </LOCATION>. `` The expense and sophistication of biotechnology will narrow the range of individuals directly involved in breeding animals and plants,'' the report said. `` Questions about who will be served by this technology and who will set the research agenda are of paramount importance when so few people control the tools and language of the trade.'' Private companies, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, state and regional experiment facilities, and the agricultural scientific community in general are advancing rapidly into biotechnology frontier. Crops with built-in `` insecticides'' and livestock with genetic capabilities to produce more meat and milk are some of the obvious goals. `` Properly directed, agricultural research and biotechnology can make agriculture more efficient by providing ways to replace capital and purchased inputs -LRB- production items -RRB- with the labor and management of more family farmers,'' the report said. For example, the center said a new development which could save a farmer $ 5 per hog produced in return for an additional $ 2 worth of time spent on management and labor would `` increase family farm opportunities and make agriculture more efficient by decreasing production costs.'' <PERSON> Hassebrook </PERSON> outlined the report Thursday to <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> agriculture committee staffers in hopes of gathering congressional support for a closer scrutiny of biotechnology's rapidly developing role in the structure of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> agriculture. `` Agricultural research is almost a form of social planning, in that the decisions you make about what research you're going to pursue is going to have a lot to do with shaping agriculture,'' <PERSON> Hassebrook </PERSON> said in an interview. The essence of the center's report is that there are two directions that can be followed by the biotechnology wave: One path leads to `` industrial production systems'' that continue the trend toward larger and fewer farms, continuous production of one or two high-value cash crops, and large-scale livestock operations that require high investment and total confinement. The other route is to `` low-input, sustainable'' family farm systems designed to preserve soil and water resources. Farmers using these systems seek to improve farm profits by cutting back on capital investments and reducing purchases of fertilizers, pesticides and other production items. `` We could use biotechnology to make agriculture more sustainable and to strengthen family farms, or we could use it to go in the other direction,'' <PERSON> Hassebrook </PERSON> said. `` The problem is that very few are asking these questions ... it's almost kind of leaving it to chance.'' The Center for Rural Affairs is a non-profit family farm research and advocacy group that began in 1973. <PERSON> Hassebrook </PERSON> has been with it since 1976.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has bought an additional 485,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat at subsidized prices. <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>, general sales manager for the department's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday the wheat was part of an authorization on Jan. 25 of more than 2 million tons under the Export Enhancement Program, or EEP <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> said the wheat is for shipment for April. Counting some left over from a previous <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> arrangement and the Jan. 25 authorization, the Soviets have 525,200 tons still available under the program. With the latest sale, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has bought almost 3.5 million tons of wheat for delivery in the sixth year of a long-term supply agreement, which was extended last fall to run through Dec. 31, 1990. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels of wheat. The 485,000 tons are equal to about 17.8 million bushels worth around $ 73 million at recent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm prices. The <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> arrangement allows private exporters to sell wheat and other designated commodities to specified countries at reduced prices in order to meet foreign competition. The exporters then collect free government surpluses of grain or other products as bonuses, or subsidies. Sales for delivery in the sixth year of the agreement also included about 10.2 million tons of corn, along with 450,000 tons of soybeans, 1.4 million tons of soybean meal, and 507,400 tons of grain sorghums. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> said the 485,000 tons of wheat were sold by The <ORGANIZATION> Peavey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, 110,000 tons; <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, 100,000; <ORGANIZATION> Bunge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, 100,000; <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, 150,000; and <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, 25,000. The companies will get subsidies of $ 22.46 per ton, or about 61 cents per bushel, under the <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> arrangement.

<HEAD>Report Criticizes EPA Handling of Grants for Community Groups</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> is making it difficult for citizen groups near Superfund hazardous waste sites to participate in a grant program, a congressional report says. The program, which provides up to $ 50,000 in grants for community groups to hire technical experts, is n't working, Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, said Thursday after releasing the report with Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass. While some community groups described <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> staff as helpful to applicants, `` many more commented that they were actively discouraged from applying or expressed the belief that the agency could not be interested ... based on the cumbersome process it had established,'' the report said. The report, based on a survey of 72 people and community groups, concluded the Technical Assistance Grant program was plagued by a long application process, difficult-to-understand forms and <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> staff resistance. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kovalick </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, deputy director of <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> and Remedial Response, said, `` Trying to empower citizen groups is a very difficult task when trying to balance fiscal responsibility and being as helpful as we can to community groups.'' He said <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> is trying to improve the program, and emphasized it was not agency policy to discourage participation. Grants are available at each of the 1,175 Superfund hazardous waste sites, so that community groups can get the technical information needed for a voice in cleanup operations. <PERSON> Kovalick </PERSON> said 13 grants have been awarded so far, and the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> is considering an additional 79 letters expressing interest. The survey found that under the program, created in 1986: _ More than 90 percent of the community groups encountered `` major problems'' with the application process, with 9 out of 10 applicants reporting difficulty in completing paperwork One out of four applicants spent more than six weeks filling out the applications. _ <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> required that communities pay 35 percent of the technical assistance costs, although <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> recommended only a 20 percent matching requirement _ The agency agreed to waive the cost-sharing requirement only in exceptional circumstances, while <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> wanted waivers whenever needed to foster public participation The report blamed the cumbersome application process for `` discouraging affected groups from participating'' in the program, and added that the 35 percent community share makes the program `` insurmountable'' for many community organizations. <PERSON> Kovalick </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> was given discretion to choose the matching contribution for communities, and felt that by setting the figure at 35 percent, there would be more federal money to spread around.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mortality rates for two of the three leading causes of death _ heart disease and stroke _ are headed downward, but cancer is on the increase as unhealthy habits of yesteryear catch up with the older population. The <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> death rate from heart disease in 1987 was 313 per 100,000 people, down from 318 the year before. For stroke, or cerebrovascular disease, the rate was 61 per 100,000, down from 62. But the mortality rate from cancer, the nation's No. 2 killer, has been going up in recent years, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. There were 196 cancer deaths in 1987 for every 100,000 Americans, up from 195 the year before. `` What we are seeing ... is the continuation of some long-term trends,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>, a researcher with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>. Heart disease, cancer and stroke account for about two-thirds of the 2 million deaths that occur in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> every year, the Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said in its weekly report. Health professionals closely analyze the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>'s statistics on the three leading causes of death for use in determining public health programs. `` They're used to monitor the health of the nation,'' <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> said. He said the cancer rate has been rising as Americans who had unhealthy lifestyles in their youth get older. But the rate should fall in coming years because of changing lifestyles among the young. For example, among 45 - to 54-year-olds the cancer rate dropped to 166 per 100,000 in 1986 from 181 per 100,000 in 1979, <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> said He attributed preventative measures of the past two decades such as improved diet and less smoking as contributing to the drop. The decline in deaths from heart disease and stroke has been a decadelong trend, said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Thom </PERSON>, an epidemiologist with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION>, Lung and <ORGANIZATION> Blood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. Most experts believe that the decline can be attributed to improvements in personal health, greater prevention of disease, improvement in medical care for heart or stroke patients, or all of those factors, <PERSON> Thom </PERSON> said. `` The decline is ... very real, and very consistent,'' he said. <PERSON> Thom </PERSON> cited trends toward quitting smoking, controlling high blood pressure and lowering cholesterol levels, as well as `` increased physical activity and, generally, health consciousness'' as factors in the decrease. At the same time, cardiac intensive care units have come into widespread use in hospitals, and heart surgery has become commonplace. `` There are plenty of reasons to think all those reasons contributed,'' he said. Heart disease killed 762,820 of the 2.2 million Americans who died in 1987. Cancer killed 477,190, and stroke killed 149,220. A year earlier, 2.1 million Americans died, including 765,490 from heart disease, 469,376 from cancer and 149,643 from stroke, <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> said. Complete mortality figures from 1988 are not yet available, <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> said. The mortality rate from heart disease was showing a slight increase from 1987 levels in the 12 months from October 1987 to September 1988, he said. But that might be traced, in part, to an influenza epidemic last winter which preyed upon those at increased risk of problems from flu _ such as patients with chronic heart disease, he said.

<HEAD>Partisan Debate on Tower; Closed Session Possible</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDs: Senate debate scheduled to begin 10:30 EST</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> debate over <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>'s troubled nomination as <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary is producing its share of partisan sparks after only one day, with one key senator holding out the possibility of airing sensitive information in a closed-door session. `` I do n't suggest it and I want to avoid it, -LRB- but -RRB- it may be necessary to have a closed session,'' <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said Thursday in the midst of a flare-up over material damaging to Tower that has been leaked from an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report. Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif., said Tower had been `` trashed'' by material that was leaked, and said those responsible never mentioned exculpatory material that also appeared in the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report `` A closed session of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would not repair the damage that's been done,'' he said. Several senators called for releasing some of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> material in sanitized form to give the public a better idea of what it contains. But when <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., raised the possibility of making the transcripts of closed committee sessions public, no Republican followed up Despite <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> expressions of outrage over the leaks, <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION>'s chances of confirmation dimmed further as three additional Democrats joined the opposition and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> conceded that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has failed to persuade any Democrat to support the nomination With a second day of debate set for today, an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> survey of senators showed 44 Democrats and Republican <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> either solidly against the nomination or leaning against, and 40 Republicans either solidly committed or leaning toward confirmation. The Democrats hold a 55-45 majority in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Republicans said they hoped to use the debate to marshal public support and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> insisted it would fight to the end. But one senior <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> senator, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he would n't rule out the possibility of a withdrawal before a vote. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> led the Democratic opposition in opening Wednesday's debate. He said he was concerned over the appearance created by Tower's acceptance of consulting fees after his service as an arms negotiator <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> cited the `` obvious tension between the information he acquired as arms control negotiator and his obligations to his consulting clients.'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> also came down hard on Tower's drinking practices. `` I personally believe he had a serious drinking problem in the 1970s and the 1980s, including recent years,'' he said. `` We're not talking about the secretary of <ORGANIZATION> interior </ORGANIZATION>, we're talking about someone next to the president at the very top of the nuclear chain of command,'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said `` The example we set here is going to work its way down.'' Republicans rushed to Tower's defense, with Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., saying that not one of the 70 current senators who served with Tower ever told the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> of seeing him unable to carry out his responsibilities Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Maine </LOCATION>, said Tower was being assailed by <ORGANIZATION> UFW </ORGANIZATION>'s _ Unidentified Flying Witnesses _ and said, `` Most of us would have to disqualify ourselves from passing judgment on issues that come before us'' if held to the standard for conflict of interest that Democrats are applying to Tower. Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, provided one of the few light moments of the day when he addressed the subject of alcohol. `` If my momma is watching I want to make it clear that the world would be a better place if the Lord had never allowed whiskey to be created,'' he said. But in a long defense of the man he replaced in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Republican said great leaders such as Civil War Gen. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> were drinkers. Discussing the conflict-of-interest charge, <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> said, `` our conflict of interest is greater than'' Tower's and he cited defense industry campaign money that lawmakers receive. `` How is our appearance less indicting than his?'' he asked. `` By this logic, the ideal guy to be secretary of defense would be a fellow who just came in on a turnip truck, who would agree not to make any decisions related to turnips or trucks, and would agree as soon as he left to retire to a monastery,'' <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> said. The testiest exchange of the day occurred after Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, began quoting witnesses who used words such as `` crocked'' to describe Tower. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, R-Ariz., interrupted and said <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> had been using material from the confidential <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> said the words had already appeared in print but offered to have them removed from the official record of debate. Sen. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, had used such language already this week. The exchange set off the round of Republican complaints about leaks, and led <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> to say the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had been guilty of the same thing in reverse _ claiming that the report contained nothing to disqualify Tower without disclosing the allegations.

<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> astronomer turned sleuth helped crack an international electronic spy ring in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> by tracking down the `` hacker'' who broke into his computer files. For more than six months, finding the computer snoop was a lonely obsession for 38-year-old <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoll </PERSON>, who initially was unable to convince the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> to investigate the computer break-in. On Thursday, a West German official announced the arrests of three hackers who allegedly acquired sensitive military computer passwords and codes and sold them to the Soviets. The Pentagon has not determined the extent of the damage to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> security. A West German television network said the passwords and other information came from key military and research computers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` I would say -LRB- <PERSON> Stoll </PERSON> -RRB- was largely responsible for cracking the case,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurley </PERSON>, former spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Lawrence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Berkeley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Stoll </PERSON> once worked. `` Over a period of many months, he tracked them.'' It all started with a 75-cent accounting error that <PERSON> Stoll </PERSON> noticed in the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> laboratory's shared-time computer system accounts in August 1986. `` If it had been $ 1,000 off, I would n't have thought anything of it,'' <PERSON> Stoll </PERSON> said in an interview Thursday. `` It's like, if your house collapses, you just assume there's been an earthquake. But if you find a tiny termite hole, you think, ` Geez, I'd better investigate.' It's the little problems that are the most fascinating.'' <PERSON> Stoll </PERSON>, a computer expert with a doctorate in astronomy from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION>, searched for clues for three days and discovered the error was caused by someone who had gained access to the computer through telephone lines. `` For four months, I did absolutely nothing but watch what he typed in,'' said the bushy-haired <PERSON> Stoll </PERSON>. <PERSON> Stoll </PERSON> said it became apparent that the hacker was trying to use the <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Laboratory </LOCATION>'s computer as a gateway to the so-called Milnet, a computer network linking defense plants, university labs and military installations. `` He was searching for key words like nuclear, ICBM, SDI, biological warfare, <LOCATION> Norad </LOCATION>. He was reading everything he could get his hands on, and then it turns out he was selling it to the Soviets,'' <PERSON> Stoll </PERSON> said. He said he told the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> about the hacker in the late summer of 1986, but there was n't much of a response. `` They said, ` What have you lost?' I said, ` Well, all we've actually lost is 75 cents. So the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said, ` Who cares, it's not important.''' To be fair, <PERSON> Stoll </PERSON> added, `` They're much more sensitive to computer break-ins now.'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinmetz </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said the bureau would not comment on the case. <PERSON> Stoll </PERSON> said his girlfriend, tired of his electronic pager that would beep whenever the hacker got onto the system, was responsible for the big break in the case. She suggested that he lay a trap. He created bogus military data and a fictitious computer network called `` SDI Net.'' The hacker took the bait, spending two hours reading through the material, giving <PERSON> Stoll </PERSON> enough time to trace the call to <LOCATION> Hanover </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Three months later, <PERSON> Stoll </PERSON> said, he got a letter from a man in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> asking for information about SDI Net. When he turned that letter over to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> in April 1987, he said, the bureau found the man had connections to Eastern European governments and immediately began an investigation. In all, <PERSON> Stoll </PERSON> said the spy ring had attempted to break into about 450 different computers and succeeded in stealing information from more than 40 of them _ including data systems at the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, defense contracting firms and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases around the world. According to a German television network, authorities believe the West German hackers were recruited by the Soviet <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 and `` were paid with cash and drugs ... and were later forced to provide the codes and passwords to the Soviets.'' <PERSON> Stoll </PERSON> now has a contract from <ORGANIZATION> Doubleday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to write a book about his not-so-amateur sleuthing. But he said he is glad the case is nearing an end so he can get back to work at the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard-Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Astrophysical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. `` In one sense, it was exciting,'' he said. `` In another sense, it was dreadful, because I got zero astronomy done for two years.''

 Instead of complaining about plans to shut down 86 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military installations <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should accept the package and provide the necessary funds for the closings say the co-chairmen of the commission that devised the plan. `` Once you start chipping away, this thing goes down the tubes,'' former Sen. <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Ribicoff </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>., on Thursday told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> defense appropriations subcommittee `` We collected a vast amount of data describing conditions at thousands of installations we were asked to review,'' said former Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ala </LOCATION>., in testimony before the corresponding <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee `` We did not just pluck this list out of thin air.'' Critics of the commission's recommendations, particularly lawmakers facing closings in their areas, have complained that the findings are flawed. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> can block the closings only if both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> pass disapproval resolutions and lawmakers can not pick and chose among bases.

 A tanker carrying 90,000 barrels of crude oil ran aground in stormy seas off the Hawaiian island of <LOCATION> Oahu </LOCATION>, officials said.

<HEAD>Administration to Present Minimum Wage Hike Plan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials say Labor Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> will outline a proposal to raise the minimum wage to $ 4.25 an hour over three years and create an hourly ` ` training wage'' of $ 3.35 at a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hearing today The plan is to be presented before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, whose chairman Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., has introduced legislation calling for a hike in the minimum wage to $ 4.55 to be accompanied by automatic periodic increases in the future Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s testimony is expected to set the stage for a renewed battle between the administration and congressional Democrats who opposed the training wage last year as a sub-minimum wage that organized labor says might threaten the jobs of higher paid workers. The minimum hourly wage has been set at $ 3.35 since 1981. A minimum wage increase to $ 4.25 by 1991 would represent a 27 percent increase over that rate. `` She will make the case that this is a proposal that fulfills President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign pledge to raise the minimum wage but recognizes that any increase means a loss in job opportunities,'' said one administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` That's why the increase is more modest'' than the increase proposed last year by <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., said the official `` And that's why the training wage is there as well, to try to offset any unemployment.'' The official said the details of the administration position, which would create a training wage to allow businesses to pay newly hired employees $ 3.35 an hour for the first six months of employment before facing a requirement to raise their pay to the full minimum, were completed late Thursday afternoon. The plan also would expand an exemption from the $ 3.35 floor that currently applys only to some small businesses in the retail and service industries to all small businesses whose annual earnings remain under a specified level. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has repeatedly linked a raise in the minimum wage to a training wage, and Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said in her confirmation hearing that she would support adding language to any legislation to prevent employers from cutting their costs by hiring people at the training wage and laying off higher paid workers.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> overwhelmingly rejected a bill that would have suspended jail terms of rapists and child molesters who voluntarily underwent surgical castration. Lawmakers voted 91-8 Thursday against the bill, which was sponsored by Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Worden </PERSON>, an investigator with the <LOCATION> Allen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> public defender office. He said he introduced the legislation because he believes as many as 80 percent of rapists and child molesters who go to prison eventually get out and commit the same crimes again. `` We've tried counseling and we've tried sentencing but that does n't work,'' said <PERSON> Worden </PERSON>. `` Castration does work.'' But opponents of the measure said castration was uncivilized punishment. `` I really question whether this solution would work,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bray </PERSON>, a former prosecutor. `` The problem is mental, not physical.'' Rep. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Newkirk </PERSON>, a former deputy prosecutor, said he sympathized with <PERSON> Worden </PERSON>'s frustration over short jail terms for sex offenders. But he said the bill was flawed because it would give a sentencing judge no option but to release a convicted offender who underwent castration. Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said the General Assembly should set standards for civilized behavior and suggested the bill would send the opposite message. <PERSON> Worden </PERSON> responded, `` Our citizens are civilized but we have some animals out there who call themselves citizens.''

 Deafening noise, yellow dust and debris filled the cabin when a huge hole ripped open in the side of a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747, crewmembers said, and the pilot said he knew he was only going to have one shot at landing the jet. `` I was praying for my life, for the lives of the passengers, that we would get down safely,'' said <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Brentlinger </PERSON>, chief purser on <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' Flight 811. Crewmembers on Thursday told of 25 terrifying minutes aboard the jet when the forward cargo door and a 10-by-10 foot section of fuselage ripped away during the Feb. 24 flight. Nine passengers were sucked from the plane and presumed dead. Twenty-seven others were injured. The pilot, Capt. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> he relied on his 38 years of training to bring the plane down. `` Part of the emergency descent procedure is to pull the power back and put on the speed brake,'' he said in today's editions of the newspaper. `` At 270 knots, you're supposed to drop the landing gear. `` Because we were on two engines, if I had done that, we would have lost too much altitude to make it back. So I held off on extending the gear,'' he said. He said he had to constantly revise airspeed calculations because the aircraft was overweight and the hole in its right side caused a lot of drag. `` It was a difficult situation to keep the aircraft pointed in the direction we wanted to go and make it do what I wanted it to do,'' <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think a 747 has ever flown on two engines at that weight. My concern for being overweight was staying airborne,'' he said. To lighten the load, 90,000 pounds of fuel were dumped. `` Things were going very rapidly then. We were very busy,'' <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> said. `` The most difficult part was we did n't have just one emergency,'' the pilot said. `` We had compounded emergencies. Usually, if an airliner has an emergency, it's usually an engine fire or a hydraulic problem.'' Normal landing speed with all four engines would have been 132 knots. The crew estimated that 170 knots would be safe. <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> said he chose to touch down at 200 knots because he was afraid of losing control of the jet if he slowed it further. `` We only had one shot at it,'' he said. `` There was no way you're going to go around again. You're going to land.'' Attendant <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> <PERSON> Umehira </PERSON> said he heard a `` big boom,'' was knocked to the floor and grabbed onto the bottom of the stairway at the back of the first-class compartment. After getting his bearings, <PERSON> Umehira </PERSON> said he saw the hole in the side of the plane about 12 feet away. `` I thought, ` This could n't be happening to me. No way, not to me,'' he said. Attendant <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> <PERSON> Lam </PERSON> was by himself `` in the pit,'' the cramped cooking galley below the main passenger deck. The explosive decompression lifted <PERSON> Lam </PERSON> off his feet and he landed on his back as he felt the plane `` go into a steep nosedive.'' Lam climbed up an emergency chute to the main cabin and said he had to crawl through `` all kinds of rubbish and debris'' and could n't see anything but yellow dust. `` I was thinking I was the only one left on the plane,'' he said. `` And then I stood up and saw the passengers.''

 Leftist rebels assaulted a military post on the capital's outskirts one day after the armed forces said they were beginning a three-month cease-fire. At least three soldiers and two civilians died in the shootout. Panicked residents of the working class <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ramon </LOCATION> neighborhood threw themselves on the ground behind walls, parked vehicles and piles of bricks at a masonry supply business as soldiers advanced on rebel attackers Thursday evening. `` Commie dogs! Show yourselves, cowards!'' some soldiers shouted as they moved forward, running in a crouch and pausing every few yards to survey the scene, aim and fire. The guerrillas attacked just before sunset, firing four anti-tank rockets at the state-owned <ORGANIZATION> ANTEL </ORGANIZATION> telephone switching station in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ramon </LOCATION>, on the northwestern edge of the city. The attack on the telephone facility, which caused no casualties and only slight damage to a brick wall, appeared to be a diversion. Minutes later, about 10 blocks away, a gunbattle broke out at the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ramon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> post, where about 20 soldiers were stationed. Several dozen troops from the <ORGANIZATION> 1st </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION> on duty nearby advanced toward the post, and the exchange escalated into a fierce battle that lasted nearly an hour. Journalists saw at least three dead soldiers loaded onto a truck. Two civilians, one an adolescent boy, also were killed. `` There are lots of dead,'' one young soldier told a journalist. Several soldiers were wounded, but there was no official casualty count early today and no indication of rebel casualties. The armed forces on Wednesday began what they said was a three-month halt to offensive operations in an effort to foster peace talks. The U.S.-backed government of President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> has called on the rebels to respond in kind. The rebels said Wednesday they were willing to declare a cease-fire once a time, place and agenda for peace talks is agreed upon. The guerrillas have said they will participate in this year's presidential election and respect its the outcome if it is postponed from March 19 until September, giving them time to prepare Earlier Thursday, the rebels said the army was violating its own cease-fire by moving into guerrilla-controlled territory. `` That demonstrates the falsehood of the supposed cease-fire,'' said the insurgents' clandestine Radio Venceremos. It did not mention fighting as a result of army troop movements, which it said occurred in the northern zones of <LOCATION> Morazan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chalatenango </LOCATION> provinces. Those areas are dominated by the rebels, who are waging a nine-year revolution against the government. A top army officer indicated the military would continue some operations despite the cease-fire. `` A cease-fire does not mean the armed forces relinquishes its constitutional duty of defending sovereignty and ensuring security, tranquility and stability,'' Col. <PERSON> Mauricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON>, commander of the eastern region, said in a televised interview Wednesday night. `` If people are up in arms in any part of the nation's territory, we have the legal and moral obligation to fight them,'' he said. The guerrillas accuse the government of procrastinating in response to their peace overture. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says the rebels' refusal to declare a cease-fire calls into question their stated desire for peace.

 A new study urges <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> to look beyond traditional sources for black and women faculty, saying the school has made little progress since its minority hiring was criticized almost a decade ago. `` We believe that there would be symbolic importance to minority and women students at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> and in the nation as a whole if there were a more visible presence at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> of faculty who share their social characteristics,'' said the report, which was issued Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Bok </PERSON> declined comment on the report. In a separate study in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, a committee of doctors and medical educators recommended that every teaching hospital in the state set a four-year goal of having blacks and Hispanics make up 11 percent of its first-year resident physicians. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Graduate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> said 12 percent, or 360, of the 3,000 first-year residents in training in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> last year were minority group members, about evenly divided between blacks and Hispanics. However, the greatest concentration of minorities was in a few <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> hospitals, it said. The <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> review of affirmative action in the university's Faculty of Arts and Sciences was requested by <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> The faculty of about 900 teachers is the liberal arts heart of the prestigious school founded in 1636 to educate young men. The 10-member panel that wrote the report included three women, two blacks, a Hispanic and an <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION>. While noting that women face difficulty finding faculty openings and advancing at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>, the panel said blacks, Hispanics and Native Americans need the most help. The pool of candidates in those groups is small and in some instances shrinking, they noted. The report advocates affirmative action, not with quotas or by stretching standards, but by looking beyond traditional routes and groups to find potential faculty. Currently, <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> has numerical targets for women and minority faculty and issues a yearly progress report, but it is not required to meet those targets. The report was considered Wednesday by the arts and sciences <ORGANIZATION> Faculty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and is expected to go to <LOCATION> Spence </LOCATION> and the full faculty for approval later this spring. Real change will rely on new attitudes rather than administrative orders, said <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolcowitz </PERSON>, assistant dean for undergraduate education and spokesman for the faculty committee. `` If <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> as the premier institution that trains the best and the brightest is a place that is absent of the best black men and women, it sends a message that we are not very good. And many of us are,'' said <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, co-chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faculty </ORGANIZATION> and Administrators. In 1980, a report prepared at the request of the school's <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> concluded that <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>'s recruitment efforts had been passive. According to the new report, in 1978-79 just 12 women were full professors, or 3.4 percent of the total. Today they number 30 or 7.8 percent. There were 44 women on the faculty headed for tenure in 1978-79 or 19.8 percent compared with 64 and 27.7 percent now. In 1978-79 the numbers of minority full professors totaled 21, or 5.9 percent, with tenure-track teachers numbering 17, or 7.7 percent. This year there are 27 full professors, or 7 percent, and 28 minorities on the way up, or 12.1 percent. To improve hiring, the new report proposes naming a special associate dean for affirmative action in Arts and Sciences; that each faculty department designate a faculty member for that effort; and that a standing faculty committee on affirmative action be established.

<HEAD>Israelis Demolish, Seal 10 Homes Of Palestinian Suspects</HEAD>

 Israeli troops demolished or sealed 10 homes in the occupied lands to punish Palestinians suspected of attacking Arab collaborators or Israeli targets, the army said today. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, the army blew up seven houses and sealed an eighth late Thursday and early today. The homes belonged to Palestinians suspected of killing an Arab collaborator and throwing firebombs at Israeli cars and homes, the army said. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, the army sealed rooms in two houses belonging to Palestinians suspected of throwing firebombs at an Israeli government office and setting on fire a bus carrying workers to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Since the beginning of the Palestinian uprising in December 1987, the army has destroyed or sealed more than 200 houses, usually before suspects were convicted of any wrongdoing. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> condemns the practice, saying it violates the right to due process of law. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, meanwhile, said a battle Thursday in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> between <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops and four <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas showed the organization is `` making fun of its promise to stop terrorism.'' Officials said the four guerrillas, who were killed, had been trying to infiltrate <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on a hostage-taking mission. `` Despite the explicit <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> promise to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that it would stop terror actions against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the infiltration attempt is a decisive proof that this terrorist organization is carrying out terror acts,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told the daily <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> opened direct contacts with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> in December after <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said he was renouncing terrorism and recognizing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Alon </PERSON> <PERSON> Liel </PERSON> said today that the latest infiltration attempt violated the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> conditions.

 County officials are asking a judge to bar a weekend rock concert for white supremacists and skinheads billed as an `` Aryan Woodstock.'' While <LOCATION> Napa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> officials had a court date today, the leader of a militant Jewish group said he would lead hundreds of protesters in a demonstration at the concert site at a ranch about 35 miles north of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` We're going to rally with our people. -LRB- We want -RRB- such a large number of people that the skinheads will show their colors and scamper away like cockroaches,'' <PERSON> Irv </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>, national chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday. He vowed to `` take whatever consequences, including arrest, including hospitalization and, if I have to, I'll give my life in this battle.'' County officials hope to block the event on the grounds that no permit was issued and that the concert would pose a public nuisance. At a hearing in <ORGANIZATION> Napa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Thursday, District Attorney <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mautner </PERSON> said the county could n't issue a permit for an event restricted according to race. Judge <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Snowden </PERSON> scheduled another hearing for today to give concert organizers time to respond to the county. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzger </PERSON>, leader of a group called the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aryan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION>, said the concert was being organized on private land and on an invitation-only basis. He said about 2,000 people had been invited to listen to such bands as the Boot Boys and Hammerhead in what has been billed as an `` Aryan Woodstock.'' `` We're going to have some speeches, we're going to have some music, and we're going to go home,'' <PERSON> Metzger </PERSON> told the board of supervisors on Tuesday. If the court blocks the concert, <PERSON> Metzger </PERSON> said his group `` takes no responsibility for the hundreds of skinheads walking aimlessly through the streets of <LOCATION> Napa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> appealed to residents of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to demonstrate against what he called a `` rock for racism concert.''

<TEXT>
 The last-minute cancellation of a town <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> hearing on military-funded anthrax research at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> did n't deter a <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION> group from expressing its opposition. `` We feel the issue is of extreme importance and we will not back down just because of a decision they have made in the last 24 hours,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonifaz </PERSON>, who is organizing efforts by the local branch of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Friends </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to stop the research. The Quakers claim the 23-year-old research project poses a health threat to the nation as well as <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION> because its findings could be used for military purposes. The group went ahead with its own meeting Thursday after the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> hearing it had requested was canceled. Anthrax is an infectious disease contracted by wild and domesticated animals, especially cattle and sheep. It is caused by a bacterium and can be transmitted to people. The chief scientist on the research project, <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorne </PERSON>, has maintained his work on the basic structure of the bacterium is aimed at finding a vaccine for the disease. Town Manager <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> DelCastilho </PERSON> said he canceled the hearing after a town attorney warned him that two of the board's four members work at the university, posing a conflict of interest. He said he hoped to appoint a fifth member to the board soon to make a quorum for a hearing. At the meeting, <PERSON> Bonifaz </PERSON>'s group presented a draft regulation that would ban military biological research. Others spoke to urge the board to stop the research, which is funded by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>. `` Research conducted under contract with the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> has military and not public health objectives. It is the military contract for this research that is of concern to us,'' said <PERSON> Nachama </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilker </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Responsible </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Genetics </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. University officials did n't attend the meeting. Chancellor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> has argued that the strain of bacteria being tested is non-virulent and has been under study for 23 years without incident. He also said the school's policy is to allow <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> research as long as it is unclassified.

<HEAD>Navajo Court Dismisses MacDonald Lawsuit Challenging Leave</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINDOW ROCK, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Navajo high court dismissed an attempt by embattled tribal chairman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> to overturn his suspension over kickback allegations. Thursday's decision by the tribal <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> apparently clears the way for the <ORGANIZATION> Navajo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to appoint an interim replacement for <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>. <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> has been under fire since witnesses, including his son, told a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> select committee that he had taken kickbacks and bribes from companies wanting to do business with the tribe. <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> has denied any wrongdoing. In a lawsuit, <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> sought to have the Council's decision to place him on leave declared illegal. He first brought the lawsuit to <LOCATION> Kayenta </LOCATION> tribal district Judge <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, his brother-in-law, who issued a temporary restraining order to stop the suspension. But the tribal <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said that <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> filed the suit in the wrong court, that the brother-in-law judge should have disqualified himself, and that the council can not be sued for its actions as a legislative body. The court's decision did not specifically address the council's Feb. 17 decision to place <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> on administrative leave Lawyers for the council majority opposing <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> declined to comment on the ruling. <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>'s office said he might issue a statement later. On Wednesday, the council authorized the tribal <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> to file a civil fraud lawsuit against <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> over the tribe's purchase of the Big Boquillas Ranch. The council's resolution said the suit should try to recover `` any and all tribal funds wrongfully obtained by the sellers.'' Witnesses before the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel testified that <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> shared a <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> oilman's $ 7.2 million profit from quick purchase and resale of the ranch to the tribe. The Navajos are the nation's largest Indian tribe. Approximately 150,000 of the tribe's 200,000 members live on the reservation, which includes much of northeastern <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> as well as parts of northwestern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and southeastern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>.

 A group of Italian opponents of capital punishment tried to boost the spirits of a 19-year-old woman who is sitting on death row while the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decides her fate. `` We tried to ease her tension because it's not easy to wait for a piece of paper that's telling you that you have to die or not,'' said Rev. <PERSON> Vito </PERSON> <PERSON> Bracone </PERSON> after a three-hour visit with <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> at the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Women's Prison. `` We tried to assure her that we'll be always with her.'' <PERSON> Bracone </PERSON> is a member of the Italian group `` Thou Shall Not Kill'' that has been protesting <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>'s sentence for two years in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, where the case has received much attention. The group planned to travel to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to deliver petitions to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> today before returning to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> is the youngest female in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> sentenced to death. She was 15 in 1985 when she and three other <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> teen-agers robbed and killed <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelke </PERSON>, a 78-year-old retired Bible teacher. <PERSON> Pelke </PERSON> was stabbed at least 30 times with a butcher knife. The state high court on Wednesday heard oral arguments in her appeal and has not indicated when it will issue a decision. At the time of <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>'s sentencing, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> law allowed the death penalty for anyone over the age of 10 convicted of murder. The age limit has since been raised to 16, but was not made retroactive. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Touchette </PERSON>, described his client as `` relaxed and happy'' after meeting the Italians. `` There's a lot of anticipation sitting there waiting. It's not the easiest thing in the world to do,'' <PERSON> Touchette </PERSON> said. `` But it's like finally it's starting to come to a conclusion _ maybe _ for her. <PERSON> Touchette </PERSON> said he's optimistic that the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> will commute his client's death sentence. `` I'm hopeful, always hopeful,'' he said. In a handwritten note to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> refused to grant interviews with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> media. `` She does n't want any negative publicity,'' said <PERSON> Patti </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolter </PERSON>, an investigator who has worked on the case with <PERSON> Touchette </PERSON>. `` She's afraid of doing or saying something that's going to influence public opinion.

 A 5-year-old <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> child was killed by neighborhood dogs in a mauling so grisly a doctor likened it to a shark attack, and a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> infant had four fingers chewed off by the family pet. The body of the <LOCATION> Ishpeming </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, child was discovered by neighbors outside the family's home. `` It appears she had been chewed upon, right down to the bone,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Tait </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> State Police. `` Based on what the doctor saw, he says it resembles a shark attack.'' <PERSON> Tait </PERSON> said residents pointed out two of three neighborhood dogs suspected in the attack, and officers killed the animals, identified as a huskie and a German shepherd. Police were searching for the third dog Thursday afternoon, he said. The child's name was withheld until her parents were notified, <PERSON> Tait </PERSON> said. `` People let their dogs run loose during the day and there have been as many as 25 in a pack,'' said <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> Trudell </PERSON>, whose store is across the street from where the attack took place. `` People do n't understand how quickly a family pet can become vicious. In <LOCATION> Ocala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, a mixed-breed puppy gnawed four fingers off a 22-day-old girl's right hand. The 7-week-old dog was described as three-quarters pit bull and one-quarter husky. <PERSON> Shaye </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynne </PERSON> <PERSON> Emminger </PERSON> was in fair condition at <ORGANIZATION> Munroe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> following the attack Wednesday morning.

<TEXT>
 Think twice before setting foot on the beaches of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION>. Thousands of hungry little parasites are waiting hidden in the sand. A city study of <PERSON> Rio </PERSON>'s beaches that was released earlier this week says those chic beaches pictured on postcards and in international travel magazines are hardly pristine. In fact, the report warns, they're downright contaminated. `` The sand is the dirtiest it's ever been on record,'' said <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Mora </PERSON>, spokesman for <PERSON> Rio </PERSON>'s sanitation department, which conducted the study. The study, conducted last month and released Tuesday, found the sand of the toniest of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>'s beaches _ <LOCATION> Copacabana </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Leme </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ipanema </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Leblon </LOCATION> _ is packed with nine types of parasites carried in animal and human feces. Among them is the potentially fatal esquistossomose parasite, which afflicts 8 million Brazilians. `` We do n't want to create a panic,'' Mayor <PERSON> Marcello </PERSON> <PERSON> Alencar </PERSON> said when he announced the study's findings. `` But the public ought to know what is happening in its city.'' <PERSON> Rio </PERSON>'s beaches, polluted in the past by chemical waste from factories and by occasional breaks in sewage lines along the beachfront, have new enemies now. They are stray animals and homeless beggars who bed down on the beaches, as well as hordes of street vendors in make-shift shacks along the shore. A week ago, in an effort to clean up the beaches, police officials raided <LOCATION> Copacabana </LOCATION> and hauled off hundreds of dollars worth of merchandise from the illegal stands parked on the beach and along the boardwalk. But the peddlers and the animals returned the next day _ with a vengeance. And the beaches took another drubbing. `` You would n't catch me taking my kids to these beaches,'' said <PERSON> Mora </PERSON>. `` The city has forgotten that it has to protect to beaches, not just rave about how pretty they are.'' He said that compared with a year ago, when the beaches were last tested for pollution, the beaches `` had gotten a lot worse.'' Despite the findings, some health experts were skeptical of the potential health threat to sunseekers. `` The sun kills the parasites on the surface,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Albeto </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Freitas </PERSON>, a disease control expert for the city. `` The danger lies in the deeper sand.'' Still, the possibility of catching a disease from the sand is greater than in past years. `` People just ought to be careful they do n't dig their feet too far under the sand,'' <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Freitas </PERSON> said. `` Otherwise, they might go home with more than a nice tan.''

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In eight days, political maverick <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON> has come out of hiding, unofficially won the Republican mayoral primary and posed a potential threat to <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>'s bid to get his father's old job. <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON>, a write-in candidate, has not been declared the official victor of Tuesday's <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> primary, but Thursday's canvass by the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commissioners </ORGANIZATION> found him ahead, 11,621 to 10,478 over <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sohn </PERSON> `` If people can spell the name <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON>, or close to it, and write it in, I mean, it was just wonderful,'' said the joyous ex-Democrat, a former alderman whose combative style is guaranteed to add spice to the campaign that leads to the April 4 general election. His apparent victory sets up a three-way battle for mayor: <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> _ both white _ and <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, a black alderman running as an independent. The scenario is similar to the 1983 Democratic primary, in which <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> and incumbent <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> split the white vote, allowing <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> to score a narrow victory on the way to eventually becoming the city's first black mayor. The winner of the April 4 election fills the final two years of the four-year term won by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, who died seven months after winning the April 1987 election. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleppner </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor who has analyzed <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> voting trends for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, downplayed the significance of <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON>'s candidacy and predicted a <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> triumph. `` <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON> will only draw white votes away -LRB- from <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> -RRB- if people are sure they're not endangering the chance of a white candidate winning,'' <PERSON> Kleppner </PERSON> said. Still, said analyst <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Roesser </PERSON>, active in local <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> circles, <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON>'s vote-drawing power far outstrips <PERSON> Sohn </PERSON>'s. `` <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> ca n't win, but he could cause some real mischief,'' <PERSON> Roesser </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, son of 21-year Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, is vacationing in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, but his chief campaign strategist, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Axelrod </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON>'s influence on the election `` will be negligible.'' Four of the city's 2,911 precincts remained to be counted and after another review, the winner of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primary will be officially declared on Tuesday. <PERSON> Sohn </PERSON>, who was endorsed by the local <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, held out hope he could still be declared the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee and his aides suggested the courts may make the final decision. <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON>, the former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, has lost his last two tries for office. He ran as an independent for mayor in 1987, then became a Republican and sought the office of clerk of the county court system last November. After the November defeat, he was rarely seen in public and gave few interviews to the news media. But on Feb. 22, less than a week before the Republican primary, he appeared at a rally and said he would run as a write-in candidate for mayor at the urging of his admirers.

<HEAD>Bomb Damages Hall In Mining Town Targeted By Black Boycott</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS thruout to UPDATE with 2nd bomb blast, details. No pickup.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A bomb blast early today shattered windows at a civic center in a mining town where blacks have launched a consumer boycott to protest the resegregation of public facilities. Police said a limpet mine placed outside <LOCATION> Carletonville </LOCATION>'s civic center banquet hall exploded shortly after midnight, causing slight damage and no injuries. Less than two hours later, a second bomb slightly damaged a power pylon in <LOCATION> Carletonville </LOCATION>, police said. No arrests were reported, and there were no claims of responsibility. White storeowners in <LOCATION> Carletonville </LOCATION> have reported a sharp drop in black patronage since the boycott began Monday in the town 45 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. The local chamber of commerce reportedly has drafted a memorandum urging the town council to abandon the resegregation campaign. Councils in <LOCATION> Carletonville </LOCATION> and dozens of other <ORGANIZATION> Transvaal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Province </ORGANIZATION> towns were taken over by the extreme-right <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in local elections last October. <LOCATION> Carletonville </LOCATION> and several other councils have restored `` whites only'' status to parks and other areas opened to all races in recent years. The governing <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has indicated it is re-evaluating the Separate Amenities Act, which allows the segregation of municipal facilities, but there has been no move to repeal it despite the government's criticism of the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> actions. On Wednesday, police reported two black men had been arrested for allegedly intimidating blacks who planned to ignore the boycott.

<HEAD>Battle of Bunker Hill Cannon Found</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 One of the four cannons that were all the 13 colonies had when the Revolutionary War started has been found in the basement of a police station, ending a search that began nearly 20 years ago. `` It is a priceless piece of history which could be called a national treasure,'' Capt. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Metrolopitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> historian, said after cannon was found Thursday. The 3 -LCB- - foot-long, 500-pound brass cannon, believed to have been forged in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> around 1760, was found behind dozens of bicycles in a storage room that was being cleaned at the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>'s Lower Basin <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> said it was used in the Battle of <LOCATION> Bunker </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> on June 17, 1775. Two of the four cannons the colonies had at the start of the Revolutionary War were captured by the British. But the rediscovered cannon, now called the <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON>, and the other, now called the <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, were hidden in a swamp in <LOCATION> Dedham </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> said. The <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON> and the <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> were placed at the Bunker Hill Monument during the 19th century. The <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> was in charge of the monument from 1919 until the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> took it over in 1975. `` When we took the site over in ` 75, there was one cannon tube -LRB- the <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> -RRB- left at the top,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Steele </PERSON>, curator of the monument. `` They were a pair. We contacted the <ORGANIZATION> MDC </ORGANIZATION> about the missing one, but no one was able to put their fingers on it. I had pretty much given up hope. This is great news.'' <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> said he knew the cannon had been brought to the police station but no one could tell him where it was, and he had been keeping an eye out for it for 18 years. He and <PERSON> Steele </PERSON> thought it had been taken from the monument in 1970 or 1972. `` What apparently happened is that a bracket holding the cannon broke,'' <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> said. `` It was brought to the station for safekeeping.'' <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> said he hopes the cannon will be refurbished and placed in new brackets at the monument by June 17, Bunker Hill Day.

<HEAD>U.S., South Korea Announce Exercises Despite Protests From North</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> today announced plans for large-scale joint military exercises despite warnings from communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> that the maneuvers could wreck prospects for peace talks. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eighth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> said about 200,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> troops, along with air force and <ORGANIZATION> navy </ORGANIZATION> units, would participate in the annual `` Team Spirit'' exercises beginning March 14. About 70,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops are to take part. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> warned Thursday during talks with South Korean delegates that `` Team Spirit'' must be abandoned if the two sides are to make progress on easing tension across the divided peninsula. North Korean officials charged `` Team Spirit'' was preparation for a nuclear attack on the North. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has been demanding a halt to `` Team Spirit'' for several months and today's announcement in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> could be used by the North to end all talks with the capitalist South. There was no immediate reaction from the North today. South Korean officials said they hoped <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> would continue talks on improving relations, but that the exercises are vital to the South's defenses. The North maintains far larger military forces than the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and seriously threatens <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s safety, they said. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> keeps armed forces estimated at 840,000 troops; <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has about 600,000 of its own forces in addition to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will be invited to send observers to the exercises to show there was no hostile intention, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said. The North has rejected similar offers in the past. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> pulled out of peace talks with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in 1986 after <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> refused to end `` Team Spirit'' that year. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said the North might do the same thing this year. North Korean and South Korean delegates failed to make progress Thursday on setting terms for talks between their prime ministers after the <PERSON> North </PERSON> said `` Team Spirit'' must be called off before the opening of substantive negotiations. The two sides agreed to meet again April 12. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> officials said `` Team Spirit'' was being held for the 14th consecutive year as a purely defensive exercise that poses no threat to the North. `` The purpose is to train American and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> forces to defend <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. It's never threatened <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in the past, and there is no threat this time,'' said a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military spokesman on condition of anonymity. The exercises will be on the same scale as in 1988, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> spokesman said. The soldiers will practice reinforcing South Korean units with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in the event of a North Korean attack. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has about 42,000 troops based in the South under a mutual defense treaty, and about 30,000 others will come from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to take part in the maneuvers. The exercise will involve <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ground forces, including units based on the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, along with major <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> units. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military officials stressed today that the exercises would be held far away from the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> border to avoid any risk of an accidental confrontation. The main exercises will be held March 14-23. The two Koreas are archrivals with hundreds of thousands of troops facing each other along their 150-mile border. The North invaded the South in 1950, launching the Korean War. They are technically still at war because no peace treaty was signed.

<HEAD>`Lend Me A Tenor,' A New Farce, Opens On Broadway</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS three grafs of other reviews; no PMs planned.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 Farce is built on desperation, and things do n't get more desperate than the doings at the <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opera </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, circa 1934 Its gala benefit performance of `` Otello'' is threatened by the apparent demise of famed Italian tenor _ and unrepentant ladies' man _ <PERSON> Tito </PERSON> <PERSON> Merelli </PERSON>. The company, along with 50 pounds of shrimp mayonnaise, may expire unless someone can be found quickly to replace the man known to his adoring fans as `` Il Stupendo.'' That is the basic setup for `` Lend Me a Tenor,'' a new farce by <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Ludwig </PERSON> that barreled into Broadway's Royale Theater on Thursday night. Although the play is slight, the evening is still delirium triumphant, primarily because of the crackerjack direction of <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaks </PERSON> and a superb cast led by <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Garber </PERSON> and <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON>. You'll know `` Lend Me a Tenor'' is a farce the minute the curtain rises on six smashing art deco doors scattered throughout designer <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON>'s all-white hotel suite. They are waiting to be slammed. And <PERSON> Zaks </PERSON> sees that they are _ in high, often hilarious, style. Tito, of course, is not dead. He's sleeping off a combination of red wine and phenobarbital. But neither the opera company manager -LRB- <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> -RRB- nor his milquetoast assistant <PERSON> Max </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Garber </PERSON> -RRB- knows that. <PERSON> Max </PERSON>, a frustrated opera performer, rises to <PERSON> Tito </PERSON>'s high C. Slapping on blackface, a shaggy wig and the singer's purple tights, he goes on for the star, and no one knows the difference. When <PERSON> Tito </PERSON> wakes up, he dons an identical costume _ did n't you know he would carry a spare _ and suddenly there are two tenors and glorious confusion. Much of the fun is physical rather than verbal _ <PERSON> Garber </PERSON> mixing a drink with his finger, <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> attacking a bowl of wax fruit or <PERSON> Garber </PERSON> desperately trying to wake up the horizontal tenor. <PERSON> Zaks </PERSON>' inventiveness is astonishing He has to work hard with <PERSON> Ludwig </PERSON>'s script Some of the jokes are obvious, unsurprising laughs, but <PERSON> Zaks </PERSON> does his best to divert attention from these dips in dialogue. Still, there are some very funny situations, particularly in the second act. The opera disguise allows <PERSON> Max </PERSON> to change his personality. He becomes forceful and is able to conquer the opera manager's daughter She's looking for a fling but only wants to be flung by <PERSON> Tito </PERSON>. <PERSON> Garber </PERSON> is all bumbling sweetness, a <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitty </PERSON> who discovers his voice and confidence at the same time. If <PERSON> Garber </PERSON> is all mumbles, <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> is all roar. The actor raises apoplexy to high art, particularly in one scene when he throws himself in a rage at Tito's inert body. Seldom has such fury been so funny. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Holgate </PERSON> ca n't quite hold onto his Italian accent, but everything else is just about right in his performance as the over-inflated Tito. He's even a fine singer. And he's perfectly matched with <PERSON> Tovah </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldshuh </PERSON> as his jealous wife who one minute is a purring pussycat, the next a snarling panther. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith-Cameron </PERSON> is fetching as the ingenue, a stereotypical role that usually is more simpering than sexy. <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Connell </PERSON> charges merrily through the play as the chairman of the opera guild and there is other good support by <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagerfelt </PERSON> as an amorous soprano and <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> as an operatic bellhop. The glamorous costumes by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivey </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON> epitomize the 1930s. Some of them are even funny, particularly an evening gown for Miss <PERSON> Connell </PERSON> that makes her, in the words of another character, `` look like the Chrysler Building.'' `` Lend Me a Tenor'' is n't Feydeau _ not much is these days, particularly on <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION>. But it is great fun, particularly because of <PERSON> Zaks </PERSON> orchestrating all those slamming doors. In other reviews: `` Sheer craziness'' is how <PERSON> Clive </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> described the play. `` If you are feeling under the weather _ or even over the weather, for that matter _ and you believe laughter is the best medicine, let me prescribe for you this lovely dose of pure, operatic idiocy.'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissel </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> called the play enjoyable `` under <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaks </PERSON> brilliant direction,'' although he noted that `` the plot would not withstand intense scrutiny.'' But in The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> said the play was `` all things farcical except hilarious ... The lines are almost never witty, settling instead for double entendres ... -LRB- and -RRB- worse, too many of the farcical situations seem like pale echoes of those in similar works from the play's period.''

 West German computer hackers have stolen data that provides access to key military and research computers in the West and passed that information to the Soviets, officials and news reports said. A West German television network on Thursday said passwords, codes and other information came from computers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> prosecutors said three people were arrested, and a TV network said at least 10 computer hackers were involved in the spy ring. The Norddeutsche Rundfunk broadcasting network said among the computers was the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s general databank, known as <ORGANIZATION> Optimus </ORGANIZATION>; a <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> and a `` Star Wars'' research computer; and computers tied to nuclear weapons and energy research at the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alamos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Fermi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accelerator </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. The network said attempts were made to gain access to the <ORGANIZATION> Lawrence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Berkeley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, which it called a key link in efforts to break into other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> computers. <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoll </PERSON>, an astrophysicist who did research at the laboratory, said up to 50 military computers were broken into through an astronomy computer, but that the hacker did not have passwords for classified information. `` We were amazed! Here's some guy breaking into an astronomy computer in <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, reaching out into military computers trying to search for information about SDI -LRB- the Strategic Defense Initiative, known as `` Star Wars'' -RRB-, about nuclear warheads,'' <PERSON> Stoll </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Thursday from his home in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Stoll </PERSON>, who works at the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Astrophysical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said he and other researchers helped break the spy ring by providing false information. He said someone linked to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc groups wrote the laboratory asking for related information, leading authorities to crack the ring. He did not elaborate. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Prechtel </PERSON>, spokesman for the Federal Prosecutor's Office in <LOCATION> Karlsruhe </LOCATION>, said police in <LOCATION> Hanover </LOCATION> arrested two computer hackers on `` suspicion of espionage activities for an eastern European intelligence agency.'' Another suspect was arrested in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, he said. `` They are suspected of breaking into foreign computer systems'' and selling information to communist agents, <PERSON> Prechtel </PERSON> said. He said investigators are trying to assess how much damage was caused to Western security interests. <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Bachmeier </PERSON>, spokesman for the federal <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, said information was provided to Soviet intelligence agents. The officials declined to elaborate. In <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> today, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s best-known club for computer hackers said that in autumn 1987, it warned federal officials about the vulnerability of international computer systems. However, <ORGANIZATION> Chaos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Wau </PERSON> <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> said federal officials `` did not take the opportunity for a talk.'' <PERSON> Norddeutsche </PERSON> <PERSON> Rundfunk </PERSON> said that at the bidding of Soviet agents, the computer hackers gained access to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Defense Department computer and important research and business computers elsewhere. The hackers obtained sensitive information that would allow the Soviets themselves to gain access to the computers and develop technology based on the information, the network said. The information would also give the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> access to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military supply depot statistics and to computers belonging to several European institutes that deal with atomic and aerospace research, the network said. `` Thousands of computer codes, passwords and programs were delivered to the Soviets,'' the network said. `` They opened the door for the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> to gain access to some of the most important computer centers of the Western world.'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bardeen </PERSON>, head of the theory group at <ORGANIZATION> Fermilab </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Batavia </LOCATION>, said Soviets participate in research there. `` So there are Soviet scientists living at <ORGANIZATION> Fermilab </ORGANIZATION> and using the computers. There is n't anything confidential or strategic in the computers. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alamos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>, said he knew of no evidence that a foreign intelligence agency had gained access to its classified computer system. <PERSON> Norddeutsche </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkfunk </PERSON> said the three suspects were detained following searches of at least six apartments in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hanover </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> ZDF </ORGANIZATION> television said the three suspects `` belonged to a hardcore of 10 hackers.'' According to <PERSON> Norddeutsche </PERSON> <PERSON> Rundfunk </PERSON>, authorities believe the three West German hackers were recruited by the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>, the Soviet intelligence agency, in 1985 and `` were paid with cash and drugs ... and were later forced to provide the codes and passwords to the Soviets.'' The network said the trio handed over information from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> at a 1985 meeting with two <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> agents in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, a laboratory official said today that unknown West German hackers broke into a computer system in a Japanese government research laboratory in 1985. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> For </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physics </ORGANIZATION> discovered that a research project was penetrated in mid-1985, laboratory spokesman <PERSON> Shinichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON> said. He said no sensitive information was stolen, and the laboratory has since heightened security by changing passwords and other measures. He said it was not known if the intruders were part of the alleged spy ring in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.

 A federal appeals court upheld a decision that 26 anti-abortion activists had violated racketeering laws with their protests, a ruling one lawyer said `` strikes a blow at the very heart'' of the anti-abortion movement. Abortion foes and their lawyers attacked the decision, calling it a serious setback for people who practice civil disobedience. A three-judge panel of the 3rd <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday upheld a lower court decision that the protesters violated racketeering laws by conspiring to prevent abortions at <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> clinic. The court also awarded about $ 110,000 in damages and attorneys' fees to the center. The center's lawsuit was the first test of the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act in a civil case against abortion demonstrators, said <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiryak </PERSON>, the lawyer who brought the action for the clinic. `` From our point of view, this is an important example that will be used nationally,'' he said. The lawsuit has been used as a model by other clinics in as many as 11 other cases still at the trial level, he said. The center had charged that the protesters used force, threats and trespassing to intimidate center employees and women seeking abortions. `` What's been going on at the center has been intimidation and fear,'' said <PERSON> Tiryak </PERSON>. `` This opinion, I think, strikes a blow at the very heart of that activity by the pro-life movement.'' An anti-abortion leader named in the suit lambasted the decision but predicted it would n't stop future demonstrations. `` The American judicial system has taken a vengeance against anyone who tries to stand up for children in the womb,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> McMonagle </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Pro-Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION>. Nevertheless, he said that since the lawsuit was filed in 1987, `` the rescue movement has taken off the ground, and <ORGANIZATION> RICO </ORGANIZATION> suits ca n't stop it now. The RICO Act has most often been used against organized crime figures, but <PERSON> Tiryak </PERSON> said it was applicable in the case because protesters used extortion _ in the form of threats and force _ to deny the center its right to operate and to deny women their right to use the center. The appelate panel unanimously upheld a June 1987 finding by a federal district jury that the protesters had engaged in a pattern of criminal activity from 1984 to 1986 designed to prevent the center from providing abortions. The appeals court said videotapes made by the center `` revealed demonstrators pushing, shoving and tugging on patients as they attempted to approach the center, knocking over and crossing police barricades and blocking the ingress of cars.'' The court rejected the protesters' argument that their actions were justified because of the issue, saying they could have used numerous legal alternatives to persuade women not to have abortions `` short of harassment.'' Tiryak contended the center lost its lease and was forced to move because of the protests. <PERSON> McMonagle </PERSON> claimed no protester was ever charged with assault, even though police were present at the demonstrations. `` Pushing does n't make a racketeer, does n't make extortionist,'' he said. <PERSON> McMonagle </PERSON> said the protesters will request that the full appeals court review the decision by the three-judge panel. The appeals court ordered the district court to further consider injunctions the center is seeking to limit the number of demonstrators outside the center and prohibit them from using bullhorns. Meanwhile, a federal judge in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> issued a temporary restraining order barring the anti-abortion group <ORGANIZATION> Operation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> from blockading women's health clinics in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> during its planned Easter week protests. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatter </PERSON>'s order, which was sought by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, instructs protesters to stay at least 15 feet away from clinics. Operation Rescue leaders said they hoped to assemble 10,000 demonstrators in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to blockade clinics from March 22-25.

<HEAD>100s Reportedly Killed As Laotian Refugees Forced Back Home</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Laotians fleeing Communist persecution have been forced back to their homeland by Thais, and `` hundreds, if not thousands'' of them have died, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> human rights group claimed today in a report. A Thai <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official denied his country had forced anyone back. The official, speaking Thursday on condition of anonymity, said the report could damage relations between <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> two weeks before scheduled talks on the repatriation of Laotians. The <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> in its report cited two November 1987 cases in which Laotian soldiers allegedly massacred groups of 33 and 16 Laotian hill people just after they were evicted from <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> soil. The 64-page report, however, gave no evidence of more recent large-scale killings. Western officials in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> involved in refugee affairs said Thursday that Laotians seeking asylum are being forced to return. The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said some slayings have been reported, but they have no evidence of hundreds of deaths. In the 1987 massacre of 33 people, which has been cited by other sources, the report quoted the sole survivor, an 8-year-old girl. She told the committee that the soldiers lined up the group, put ropes around the necks of the adults, told the women to hold their babies in front of them and opened fire. `` <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> has a policy of systematically denying asylum by pushing back Laotian asylum seekers on its northern border,'' the report said. `` This has resulted in the deaths of hundreds, if not thousands, of Laotians.'' It said the policy `` represents a serious violation of human rights and humanitarian principles.'' In January, the New York-based lawyers' committee angered <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> officials with a report saying that hundreds of Vietnamese boat people died last year after <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> authorities forced them back to sea. Large numbers of Laotians have fled their homeland since the Communists seized power in 1975. The persecution has been most severe on the hill people, or Hmongs, whom the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had recruited to fight the Communists during the <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION> war. <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> officials say they must take tough measures to curb the influx of Laotians because they say the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other Western nations are not resettling enough of them. It said that along the border, the Laotians `` are routinely subject to extortion, rape and other forms of brutality by smugglers, Thai and Vietnamese-Pathet Lao -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Laotian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- security forces and other armed parties.'' Under a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> program, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> is supposed to allow entry to all Laotians into <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> for an interview to determine whether they fled political persecution or are economic migrants. But the report said sections of the border are sealed off. Along other border areas, `` extortion and bribery are widespread,'' with some Laotians having to pay Thai officials to receive an interview, the report said. The report said that if fair procedures can not be achieved, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> refugee agency should `` publicly denounce'' the interview program. Western officials confirmed the abuses related to the screening. According to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> figures through December, the Thais screened 26,067 Laotians and admitted 22,492 of them as refugees. The report also criticized abuses by <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> officials in the U.N.-aided camps housing about 76,000 Laotians. The camp commander at <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Kham </PERSON> allegedly humiliated, tortured and raped refugees. He was transferred in May 1988 but has not been prosecuted, the report said.

<HEAD>Judge Rejects Veterans' Lawsuit Over Flag Displayed On Floor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag that is spread on the floor at a student art exhibit can stay put, a judge ruled, but students protested school restrictions on who could see it. `` It is good to know that the flag has not lost its ability to communicate ideas,'' <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillis </PERSON> said in rejecting a lawsuit filed by veterans groups that sought to prevent the flag from being displayed on the floor. The exhibit at the School of the <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> `` is as much an invitation to think about the flag as it is an invitation to step on the flag,'' <PERSON> Gillis </PERSON> said. `` It seems to me that this country is large enough to permit this expression,'' <PERSON> Gillis </PERSON> said. `` Expression is part of the equation that makes this country strong.'' While the judge ruled Thursday it is not illegal for the artist to place the flag on the floor, he said it is unlawful for viewers to step on it. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Veterans of Foreign Wars, said he was `` very hurt'' by <PERSON> Gillis </PERSON>' dismissal of the lawsuit. `` The flag to me is a living thing and they do n't have any right to do that to it,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. `` But we'll abide by the ruling. It's a nation of laws.'' Veterans contend the work invites viewers to trample the flag. The exhibit of students' work was reopened Thursday after protests last week prompted a closure, but only students, faculty and staff were permitted. Students immediately protested the limitation and urged the exhibit be opened to the public and the media. `` Only in a space open to the public does freedom of expression truly exist. Restricted viewing is censorship,'' <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a student spokesman, said at a rally outside the school as about 200 people cheered. Administrators said the limited reopening would preserve the artist's rights while protecting the school and other students. `` Our main concern right now is to maintain security and to keep the show open for faculty, staff and students,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, the school's vice president. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>, the artist, said at the rally that although the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag symbolizes freedom to some people, it represents domination and suppression to others. In his work, titled `` What is the Proper Way to Display a <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Flag?'' a flag is spread on the floor in front of a montage of photographs of flag-draped coffins, South Koreans burning the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag and other scenes. Visitors are invited to comment in a ledger on a shelf below the montage.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s foreign secretary said in an interview broadcast today in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> that `` The Satanic Verses'' offends Moslems and British, but <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s president said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> will be `` forced to apologize and retreat.'' Foreign Secretary Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> made his comments after the Iranian parliament voted Tuesday to break diplomatic ties with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> within one week if British officials refused to disavow the controversial novel by <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>. <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> said today the novel not only offended Moslems but also insulted the British by comparing their country to <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. While carefully distancing his government from the novel, however, <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> defended the right of <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> to publish the work. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> shot back: `` Whether <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> apologizes or not, there is no doubt that it will be forced to apologize and retreat in the face of the great Islamic nation.'' His remarks, reported by the official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, were made at mass prayers today. In a commentary, the news agency spurned <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>'s conciliatory remarks. `` Though <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> seemed interested in ties with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and agreed that the book has hurt Moslem feelings, his interview showed no signs that the <LOCATION> U.K. </LOCATION> government has revised its stance on the satanic work,'' <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said late Thursday. `` The interview made it clear that he was playing with words.'' <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> also ridiculed what it called `` those stereotyped statements of ` the right of freedom to speak,' which have become customary of <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> officials of late who seem to be unmoved by the injured feelings of the planet's more than one billion Moslems.'' The interview with <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> was broadcast by the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Persian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> Thursday night and this morning, the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> said. It was to be repeated later today. British officials said Thursday they had rejected an Iranian offer of negotiations, saying <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> must first renounce its call for violence in the dispute. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claimed the overtures for conciliation came from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and that <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> remains subject to `` divine justice.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s spiritual leader, the <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, on Feb. 14 told Moslems to kill <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> for the novel, which many Moslems say is blasphemous. Iranian Moslem clergymen have offered a bounty of $ 5.2 million for the death of the writer, who was born a Moslem in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, now a British citizen, has been in hiding under police protection with his American wife, novelist <PERSON> Marianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiggins </PERSON>. In his comments, <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> insisted there was no point talking to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> while the death threat against <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> remains in place. <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> said: `` We do understand that the book has been found deeply offensive by people of the Moslem faith. `` I do emphasize that we are not upholding the right of freedom to speak because we like the book, because we agree with the book. The British government, the British people, do not have any affection for the book. `` The book is extremely critical, rude about us. It compares <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. We do not like that any more than the people of the Moslem faith like the attacks on their faith contained in the book.'' <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> did not elaborate. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, 41, is a fierce critic of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s colonial past and of what he views as racial prejudice among whites toward minority ethnic immigrants in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. In one passage in his book, an Indian is beaten by British authorities and made to eat excrement. The dispute over the novel has roiled relations between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and many western countries. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, its 11 partners in the European Common Market, and several other nations have pulled their top envoys from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has retaliated in kind. <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> is to meet in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> on Monday with Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, who held talks over the weekend with <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> and Iranian leaders. Soviet officials have indicated a willingness to mediate the dispute. Egyptian author <PERSON> Naguib </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahfouz </PERSON> on Thursday urged Moslem countries to condemn <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s call for assassinating <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, but he also proposed a boycott against publishers of <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s book. <PERSON> Mahfouz </PERSON>, who last year became the first Arab to win the Nobel Prize for Literature, made his comments in an article in the state newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Al-Ahram </ORGANIZATION>. `` The Satanic Verses'' is banned in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and several other countries. At least 18 people have died in protests against the book in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>.

 A tanker carrying 90,000 barrels of crude oil ran aground in stormy seas about 15 miles from <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>'s most popular tourist area, spilling an estimated 117,000 gallons of fuel oil and crude into the water, officials said. <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Spangler </PERSON> said the 800-foot tanker <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> sent a distress call at 8:20 p.m. Thursday off the Hawaiian island of <LOCATION> Oahu </LOCATION>. The captain of the tanker reported the ship was `` hard aground'' three-tenths of a mile northwest of Barbers Point on <LOCATION> Oahu </LOCATION>'s southwest coast, about 15 miles west of the island's densely populated area containing <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Waikiki </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, its most popular tourist area, <PERSON> Spangler </PERSON> said `` They've told us their fuel tanks were completedly emptied,'' <PERSON> Spangler </PERSON> said. He said an estimated 92,000 gallons of fuel oil had leaked through holes in the tanker's hull and 25,000 gallons of crude oil had spilled. <PERSON> Spangler </PERSON> said it was n't clear whether the crude leaked when the tanker broke loose from its moorings in 12-to-14-foot seas, or whether it spilled through holes in the hull. Officials do n't know if crude is continuing to leak, he added. <PERSON> Spangler </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Oahu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported early today that fuel oil was washing ashore on the beach at Barbers Point. However, he said the length of shoreline affected probably would n't be known until daybreak Winds and ocean currents should direct the spill east toward <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Spangler </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Earlier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> reports said rough seas appeared to be dissipating the oil. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Alcantara </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> attorney for <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>, said the ship's captain, <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Dick </PERSON>, and the 23-member crew have remained aboard and were in no danger `` They said they've suffered some damage, but they do n't know how much yet,'' <PERSON> Spangler </PERSON> said. The <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Houston </PERSON> was unloading <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> North Slope oil at the <ORGANIZATION> Hawaiian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refinery </ORGANIZATION> at about 5:25 p.m. when a mooring line broke, causing the offloading hoses to break, said <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the refinery's parent company. The vessel reported trouble but did not request <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> assistance when it broke its moorings, <PERSON> Spangler </PERSON> said. A total of nine commercial and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> tugboats were dispatched to help dislodge the tanker, and environmental specialists also were en route, officials said.

 <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakolta </PERSON> unexpectedly won a skirmish and now she wants to start a battle against what she says are sexually oriented and violent programs that cut into the network television fare her children can watch. The 40-year-old mother of four, offended by the off-color humor on the prime-time series `` Married ... With Children,'' conveyed her distaste to the show's major advertisers in a flurry of letters starting in January. Much to Mrs. <PERSON> Rakolta </PERSON>'s surprise, the letters prompted two of the nation's largest advertisers, <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> McDonalds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, and several others to pull their commercials from the series, the top-rated program on the fledgling <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> network. `` The American family is being painted into a corner. It's an invasion of my privacy at this point,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Rakolta </PERSON> said Thursday. She said she objects to having to monitor prime-time television for shows she does n't want her younger children to watch. `` If people want that stuff, they can pay for it, or rent it, or go to the movies,'' she said. But <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, which has tried to attract young adult audiences, has had no trouble selling advertising time on the Sunday evening show despite Mrs. <PERSON> Rakolta </PERSON>'s efforts, said <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Turell </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` The show is completely sold out,'' he said, adding that reports of Mrs. <PERSON> Rakolta </PERSON>'s campaign have rallied support behind the show. `` We have received literally hundreds of telephone calls today from across the country from viewers saying that this one woman's opinion is getting too much attention and hoping that we wo n't change the show,'' <PERSON> Turell </PERSON> Mrs. <PERSON> Rakolta </PERSON>, who lives in the affluent suburb of <LOCATION> Bloomfield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> and has three daughters, ages 18, 10 and 9, and a son, 8, said she intends to start a group, or join existing ones, to organize national boycotts of advertisers. Her writing campaign began one Sunday night in January when she and her children watched `` Married ... With Children'' and she ended up shooing the children out of the room. The situation comedy, which began in 1987, is about a blue-collar family headed by shoe-store clerk <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Rakolta </PERSON> said the first show she saw featured a man's visit to a lingerie store. `` In the store, one woman removed her bra for strangers, asking how she looked. It showed a man that worked there, an older man, walking around in a garter belt. They mentioned vibrators on the show,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Rakolta </PERSON> said. `` I was thinking it was a family program because it was prime time, 8:30 p.m. I was horrified. I wanted to know what kind of sponsors would sponsor a show like this,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Rakolta </PERSON> said she watched other episodes to see who advertised, then stayed up to 4 a.m. writing letters. Since she wrote to them, <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Kimberly-Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Tambrands </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> have told their advertising agencies not to buy time on the program. `` We felt that the whole theme of the show is basically one we do not want to be associated with. We were concerned about the negative portrayal of American family life,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON>. The president of <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON>, said his company will screen future episodes more closely. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bay </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> vice president, defended the <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> family as `` a comedic counterpoint to other fictional television families who enjoy above average incomes, greater opportunities and have more refined tastes.'' <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Katz </PERSON>, executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Vitt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> ad buyer, said the amount of sex depicted on television is rising dramatically, adding, `` As it increases, advertisers become more sensitive to it.''

<TEXT>
 A couple in the midst of a divorce are fighting for custody of the fertilized eggs they put in frozen storage a few years ago. <PERSON> Junior </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, 30, says he does not want his wife, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, 28, to become pregnant, and a judge has issued an order temporarily blocking her from having the embryos implanted. Despite <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' divorce petition and his objection to becoming a father, Mrs. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> has said she eventually plans to have the eggs implanted, according to the complaint. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> contends that he and wife jointly own the fertilized eggs and that any plans to use the frozen embryos to become pregnant _ as late as several years from now _ have an impact on his life. <ORGANIZATION> Blount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> W. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> has agreed, and on Feb. 23 he issued the order that also prohibits Mrs. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> from removing any of the eggs from frozen storage pending further hearings. Seven of the couple's fertilized eggs are stored at <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sanders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, the complaint said. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday he had no comment. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> did not return a telephone call made to the <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION> company where she works. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON>, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' <LOCATION> Maryville </LOCATION> lawyer, said he would not comment on the case. In in-vitro fertilization, the woman's ova are surgically removed and fertilized with sperm in a laboratory container, then implanted in the woman's womb in hopes of a pregnancy. <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> pioneered the practice and produced the world's first `` test-tube baby'' in 1978 Since then, other infertile couples have resorted to the method, which costs between $ 4,000 and $ 10,000 and has an approximately 15 percent success rate for each implant.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have agreed to increases in their embassy staffs, reversing a cutback forced by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration after reporter <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniloff </PERSON> was accused in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> of spying. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said Friday that 18 positions were added last month to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy in the Soviet capital and to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Embassy </LOCATION> here, along with two additional slots at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet consulates in <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. On Aug. 1, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said, 13 additional slots will be added to each of the embassies and two more to the consulates. The maximums then would be 256 for the embassies and 30 for the consulates. <PERSON> Daniloff </PERSON>'s arrest _ he was subsequently released _ touched off a diplomatic tiff in which the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration in October 1986 imposed ceilings of 225 at the embassies and 26 at the consulates.

<HEAD>Hijacked Plane's Steward Says Younis Pretended to Kill Guards</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A steward from a Jordanian jet hijacked in 1985 testified Friday that accused sky pirate <PERSON> Fawaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> threatened to kill passengers and crew and tricked them into believing his men had shot the plane's security guards. The steward, <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Suliman </PERSON> <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghadi </PERSON>, 32, was the fifth witness in the trial at <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to identify <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> as the leader of five heavily armed men who stormed aboard <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jordanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight 402 in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on June 11, 1985. In the initial moments of the hijacking, <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghadi </PERSON> testified, <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> ran to the front of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727, pounded on the locked cockpit door with his gun and shouted, `` If you do n't open the door, I will explode it.'' The hijackers were armed with AK-47 assault rifles and hand grenades, according to testimony from other witnesses and a videotape taken at the end of the 30-hour ordeal. The testimony by <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghadi </PERSON> was the first during the five-day trial to portray <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> as directly threatening the passengers and crew with death. <PERSON> Younis </PERSON>, 30, has pleaded innocent to a six-count indictment stemming from the hijacking. He was captured by <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents in international waters in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> more than two years after the hijacking, on Sept. 13, 1987, and the trial is seen as a test of a 1984 statute in which <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities assert `` long-arm'' jurisdiction over the taking of American hostages abroad. Near the end of the hijacking, <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghadi </PERSON> testified, the sky pirates told passengers and crew that at 7 a.m. the following morning, they would `` start killing'' them, `` the security officers first.'' The hijackers removed jewelry from a female security officer, and led all nine of them off the plane. `` We heard gunfire,'' testified <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghadi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Younis </PERSON>, called Nazeeh by the other hijackers, came back aboard and said, `` That's it. We killed the security and put their bodies in the cargo of the airplane.'' The security officers were not, in fact killed, and <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghadi </PERSON> said that when he saw them later in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, `` I was shocked.'' <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghadi </PERSON> began his testimony by describing the early moments of the hijacking, as gunshots were heard outside the plane, passengers streamed inside, knocking the sky marshals off balance, and the hijackers ran aboard. The steward testified that he refused orders from the hijackers to close the door of the airplane for take-off, and that a few moments later, <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> emerged from the cockpit `` slapping and pushing'' the flight engineer to the rear to close the door. Another hijacker, called `` No. 2'' by <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghadi </PERSON>, then began to beat the female security guard and threatened her with a knife. <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghadi </PERSON> intervened. `` Hijacker No. 2 put his submachine gun at the back of my head'' and ordered him to search her, the steward testified. After refueling in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, the hijackers ordered the plane flown to <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>, where they wanted to read a statement demanding that Palestinians be removed from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Tunisian authorities blocked the runways with trucks and the plane returned to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The sky marshals were taken off the plane, followed several hours later by the passengers and crew, most of whom shook hands with the <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> as they left. <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghadi </PERSON> said he refused to shake hands and was again threatened with death but was allowed to board a bus with the other passengers and crew.

<HEAD>School System Closes Early Due To Racial Tensions Over Rebel Flag</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WATER VALLEY, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Racial tensions sparked when several white students waved <ORGANIZATION> Confederate </ORGANIZATION> flags during a black history program prompted officials to close classes for spring vacation two weeks early. `` We could tell this morning there was potential for disturbances and decided to dismiss,'' school Superintendent <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON> said after students were sent home at 8:30 a.m. Friday. He said the week-long spring holiday would begin Monday instead of March 20 and `` will be a cooling off period.'' Authorities said no violence had been reported, but blacks had walked off the football and baseball teams at the 600-student high school and tensions were high. The problem developed Monday when several white students waved Confederate flags during a program for black history month at the high school. <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON> said the five or six students who created the disturbance had been disciplined but not all had been suspended. In protest of Monday's incident, black athletes began a boycott of the football and baseball teams. Several black students interviewed after school Thursday said they dropped out of sports activities because they were `` hurt by what the white kids did.'' Some of the whites involved in the flag incident were members of the football team, said one black player who asked not to be identified. `` We've been playing with them all this time and then they do that. ... It hurt us,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eagle </ORGANIZATION> quoted sources close to the football and baseball teams as saying most of the players were boycotting at the request of their parents. One parent, who also asked not to be identified, said athletes would not return to the teams `` until we say they can.'' About 60 parents of black students met Thursday night with <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON> and high school Principal <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Holt </PERSON> to discuss the problem. <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON> said no real progress was made but people `` got to vent their frustrations.'' `` There was n't as much tension at school Thursday but things kind of became inflamed late yesterday and last night,'' <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON> said in announcing his decision. He said school administrators would report for work next week during the rescheduled holiday break and would be available to discuss problems with parents and students.

<HEAD>City Tells Church to Move Because It's Too Close to Liquor Store</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINTER GARDEN, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Saying the law works both ways, officials are forcing a storefront church to move because it's too close to a liquor store and lounge. Residents of this community near <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> voted in 1984 to change the city charter to prohibit business within 1,200 feet of a school or church from selling liquor. The intent may have been to protect churchgoers and schoolchildren, city commissioners said, but in this case, the liquor store was there first _ by 24 years, so the <ORGANIZATION> Oakview </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> will have to leave. The 40-member church, which holds services on Sundays and Wednesdays, moved into the one-room office in September. Part-time pastor <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Voss </PERSON>, a school bus driver, says moving would be a hardship. The 5-year-old church has moved several times and had only $ 5 in its treasury after he paid last month's rent of $ 375, he said Thursday. He questioned why the city did n't catch the infraction earlier. The congregation is made up of fruit pickers, house cleaners, bus drivers and security guards. `` We just barely can make it. We do n't have much income,'' said <PERSON> Voss </PERSON>, who is not paid a salary A member of the code enforcement board raised the issue when commissioners met with three city boards last month. The city attorney was asked to research the question, and he reported last week that the church violated the city charter. The law can not be changed without a voter referendum. `` Personally, I wish nobody had brought it up,'' said Commissioner <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rees </PERSON>. Commissioner <PERSON> Theo </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, who was instrumental in the petition drive that got the 1,200-foot restriction on the ballot, said, `` The intent was not to stop a church from coming in. If they want to be that close to a bar, that's their business.'' The city code enforcement officer, <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Venable </PERSON>, said the church had 30 days to leave.

<HEAD>Orders Down 1.3 Percent in January Due to Transportation Declines</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Economy, Bjt</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Orders to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories for manufactured goods declined 1.3 percent in January, reflecting a fallback in demand for transportation equipment from record levels a month earlier, the government reported Friday. Analysts said that despite the overall decline, the report provided evidence of continued strength in the economy. Excluding transportation, orders were up 0.2 percent in January after a 1.8 percent rise in December. The category of non-defense capital goods, viewed as a barometer of future industry investment plans, rose 1.6 percent in January to $ 40.1 billion. `` There may be a little more strength in investment than we had previously thought,'' said economist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagens </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> WEFA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a forecasting firm in <PERSON> Bala </PERSON> <PERSON> Cynwyd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa </LOCATION>. Overall, orders for durable and non-durable manufactured goods fell to a seasonally adjusted $ 235.8 billion in January after posting a 4.7 percent increase in December, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported. It was the first decline in factory orders since a 1.9 percent drop in September. The decline was attributed to a retreat in demand for ships, tanks and planes that resulted in an 8.5 percent decline in orders for transportation equipment last month. The category had surged 22.1 percent during the previous month to a record $ 39.6 billion. The motor vehicle, aircraft and shipbuilding industries all had posted large gains in December. Defense orders, subject to wide swings depending on when contracts are signed, plunged 33.9 percent in January to $ 6.9 billion after a 24 percent surge in December. Excluding the military, orders were up 0.2 percent in January after a 4 percent gain in December. Analysts expect economic growth to slow this year as the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> continues to tighten its grip on the money supply to cool the economy and dampen inflationary pressures. But most economic reports for January have signaled continued strength in the economy at the start of the new year. <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said January's factory orders figures were `` consistent with the feeling that the economy is still growing at a respectable rate.'' For all of 1988, orders for manufacturers' goods were up 9.7 percent, the best showing since 1979, after posting a 7.1 percent gain during 1987. American manufacturing was bolstered by strong demand for exports in the past two years as the decline in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies made <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> products more competitive in the international marketplace. In January, orders for `` big ticket'' durable goods _ items expected to last three years or longer _ were down 2.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted $ 128.5 billion. Demand for non-durable goods, meanwhile, was up 0.5 percent to $ 107.3 billion. Shipments of manufacturered goods were up 0.3 percent in January to a seasonally adjusted $ 231.6 billion.

 An oil slick was spotted today off sensitive marine reserves in the northern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION>, but <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officials said the spill did not appear to be a threat to the area. A flyover by <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officials found the slick was 2 miles long and a quarter-mile wide, much smaller than first reported. `` It's not as bad as we feared,'' <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Dye </PERSON> said. Parks in the area reported small gobs of tar washing up, and said there did not appear to be major damage. <PERSON> Dye </PERSON> said dead birds were found out near the oil, but it was not clear if they were killed by the slick. A fisherman reported the oil just before 10 a.m., <PERSON> Dye </PERSON> said. `` We have no idea where it came from,'' he said. `` There are apparently no ships in the area.'' The Gulf Stream runs past Key Largo at that point, which means the oil could have come north from <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> or even farther away. The oil floated close to two sensitive north <LOCATION> Key </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Largo </LOCATION> marine reserves _ the <ORGANIZATION> Key </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Largo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sanctuary </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pennekamp </PERSON> Coral Reef State Park. <PERSON> Pennekamp </PERSON> boasts the nation's only shallow-water living coral reef, which also extends into the federal Key Largo reserves. Coast Guard and park officials will consult to decide whether to order booms placed around the slick immediately and send boats to clean up the oil, <PERSON> Dye </PERSON> said. Although the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said the spill was 10 to 12 miles offshore, there were reports of tar balls at the 120-square-mile Key Largo reserve, said park spokeswoman <PERSON> Maddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON>. `` We do n't know too much just yet, but we've gotten reports that we've got crude oil and tar balls from the size of baseballs to the size of grapefruit,'' she said. The 20-mile-long reserve stretches north from Molasses Point off the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> shore of Key Largo, and includes the area outside the 3-mile limit, while <PERSON> Pennekamp </PERSON> includes the shoreline and out to the 3-mile limit in some of the same areas, she said.

<TEXT>
 Government troops and workers ordered to abandon war-torn northern <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> to rebels, were stranded Friday for lack of transport, an African diplomat said. `` I understand it will take them a long time before they can return,'' the foreign envoy said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s capital, <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>. If troops, civil servants and other officials abandon <LOCATION> Tigray </LOCATION> province, as ordered Monday by the government, that would leave the administration with no overland access to <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION>, the extreme northern province that has the East African nation's only ports. The government still is flying planes into <LOCATION> Assab </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Massawa </LOCATION>, its main ports on the Red Sea. The retreat follows a series of rebel victories which the government referred to indirectly Thursday in a statement urging Ethiopians `` to be ready for an active involvement in every area of the armed struggle.'' `` No nation can tolerate violence, and there is no alternative now except to join hands and diffuse the aggression launched against the <LOCATION> Ethiopian </LOCATION> people,'' said the statement, published by the official <ORGANIZATION> Ethiopian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. The diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he did not know if rebels have moved into towns in northern <LOCATION> Tigray </LOCATION> province evacuated by the government. `` There are no government troops fighting there,'' he said. `` Even those who are left are in southern <LOCATION> Tigray </LOCATION>. There are no government officials in the north.'' The government did not refer directly to Tuesday reports by insurgents that the government had evacuated <PERSON> Tigray </PERSON>'s provincial capital, <ORGANIZATION> Mekele </ORGANIZATION>, `` fearing humiliating and shaking defeat as in <PERSON> Enda </PERSON> <PERSON> Selassie </PERSON> and surrounding areas.'' <PERSON> Enda </PERSON> <PERSON> Selassie </PERSON> is near <LOCATION> Mekele </LOCATION>, 475 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>. `` The whole of <LOCATION> Tigray </LOCATION> is now liberated from the fascist regime of <LOCATION> Mengistu </LOCATION>,'' rebel spokesman <PERSON> Yemane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kidane </PERSON> told a reporter in <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s capital, <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> The government said `` the secessionist <ORGANIZATION> TPLF </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Eritrean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> had coordinated attacks against Ethiopian army along <LOCATION> Adwa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Aksum </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Enda </PERSON> <PERSON> Selassie </PERSON> route with the view to dismember the <LOCATION> Ethiopian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> area from the rest of the country.'' <PERSON> Kidane </PERSON> said Tigrean rebels destroyed <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s 206th army corps, killing and wounding 14,645 soldiers and capturing 12,975, including a general. Rebel claims often are exaggerated and there was no way to verify <PERSON> Kidane </PERSON>'s statement. Early last year, Tigrean and Eritrean rebels in a joint offensive captured several towns, which the government retook in a midyear counteroffensive. Eritrean rebels have been fighting for independence since 1962 in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s oldest civil war. The Tigreans took up arms to demand more autonomy. <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION> inherited the rebellion in 1974 when he and fellow officers overthrew the late Emperor <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Selassie </PERSON> and established a Marxist government.

<HEAD>Town Raises Money, Police Officers Recalled</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MCKEESPORT, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Twenty-one laid-off police officers are being called back to work because a drive by residents, churches and businesses raised more than the $ 90,000 needed to pay them, the mayor of this strapped steel town said Friday. `` I'm overwhelmed by how the people opened up their hearts and pocketbooks,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Washowich </PERSON>. `` We're a struggling community trying to make some type of economic recovery.'' Organizers of the drive to collect $ 90,000 said the total reached $ 94,000 by noon Friday. <PERSON> Washowich </PERSON> said the officers, nearly half the force, would return to work Sunday, one week after being laid off. `` This past week, while it's been very busy, the good Lord must have been watching us because we did n't have anything terrible happen,'' Police Chief <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brletic </PERSON> said. The mayor had asked all employees to take a wage freeze after the city discovered a $ 1.3 million deficit late last year, and he had said layoffs would result if the request was refused. <PERSON> Washowich </PERSON> ordered the police layoffs after a panel of state arbitrators awarded the police department 4 percent to 4 -LCB- percent pay raises. He said the city would save $ 90,000 by laying off the 21 officers for three months. Twenty-nine officers remained on the job. The city's volunteer ambulance company, <ORGANIZATION> McKeesport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, launched the fund-raising drive with a $ 15,000 donation. Residents dropped money into cans at churches, clubs, restaurants and businesses, and the ambulance company recorded the fund total each day on a cardboard thermometer posted at its station. The money includes the contributions of <ORGANIZATION> Equibank </ORGANIZATION>, which agreed to match every donation dollar for dollar. `` From the beginning I thought we would get the money, but I'm surprised we got it this quick,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>, recording secretary of the ambulance company Funeral home owner <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaworski </PERSON> donated $ 200. `` I just want to help our police force,'' he said. `` They do a lot for me here. We have a lot of vandalism around here and all I do is give them a call and they're on their way.'' <PERSON> Washowich </PERSON> said the success of the fundraiser wo n't solve the city's money problems and he has no idea how <LOCATION> McKeesport </LOCATION> will pay for the next year's police wage increase. `` I'm sorry to say the reality will set in,'' he said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called Friday for banning the production and use of ozone-depleting chemicals entirely by the end of the century if adequate substitutes can be found. The moves to protect the world's ozone layer, which shields the earth from much of the sun's cancer-causing ultraviolet rays, came on the heels of a decision Thursday by 12 European countries to pursue a ban on the chemicals instead of only cutting back on production, as the world's industrial nations had earlier agreed to do. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> accounts for about one-third of the production of ozone-damaging chemicals, primarily chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, which are widely used as coolants in refrigerators and air conditions and as a cleaning agent for electronic and computer equipment. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, had sought the stronger administration position on CFCs prior to his departure Friday for <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> where representatives from more than 100 nations are meeting to discuss the ozone-depletion problem. <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, according to administration sources, had strongly recommended at a White House meeting Thursday that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should join its European allies and call for the complete elimination of CFCs, as opposed to cutting production by only 50 percent as required by current treaty. Under a 1987 treaty, the industrial nations are committed to halving <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> production by the year 2,000, but many scientists have said that such a cutback would not be enough to protect against serious ozone depletion. On Thursday, the 12 nations of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> announced in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, that they have agreed to a total ban on the chemical in their countries by the end of the century. <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> is known to have wanted to carry a similar commitment with him to the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> conference, which is scheduled to begin Sunday. `` We intend to reaffirm the strong position of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> about chlorofluorocarbon manufacture and use,'' <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said Friday, adding that `` we intend to maintain our leadership'' among the world's nations in dealing with the ozone-depletion problem. Scientists have raised concerns about the chemical because it does not break down at lower altitudes and floats into the stratosphere, where it breaks down and interacts with the gaseous veil of ozone that shields against the sun's cancer-causing ultraviolet rays. After scientists detected increasing ozone depletion, the industrial nations agreed in September, 1987 to a pledge of sharp cut in the production of ozone-depleting chemicals _ primarily CFCs but also three halon chemicals _ by the end of 1999. The treaty has been ratified by nearly 40 nations, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, most of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. But it includes a provision that allows additional measures, including a complete ban, if further ozone damage is found. The parties to the treaty are scheduled to consider an accelerated phase out schedule _ which is provided for in the 1987 accord _ at a meeting in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> in early May. The meeting that will begin Sunday in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, attracting representatives from more than 100 nations, is described as a dress rehearsal for the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> session. According to the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> produces roughly one-third of the world's CFCs, with E.I. <ORGANIZATION> DuPont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nemours </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> the world's largest producer. There were 750 million pounds of CFCs produced in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year and about the same amount in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> Dupont </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Dupont </ORGANIZATION>, which accounts for about half of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> production, has announced plans to stop making the chemical, perhaps as early as the mid-1990s and will begin to offer substitutes next year. `` We think in the mid-90s is when we'll see the wide scale introduction of the alternatives,'' said <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Forte </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Dupont </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said in a telephone interview. The manufacturers of packaging for many food containers already have stopped using CFCs as a blowing agent in the formulation of plastics. But industry and <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials have acknowledged continuing problems in developing adequate CFC substitutes for some uses. A substitute for CFCs used widely as a cleaning solvent for computer and electrical equipment has been particularly difficult, suggested industry experts. The EPA is still conducting toxicity tests for a number of the <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> substitutes, said agency spokesman <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>. Ms. Forte at <ORGANIZATION> Dupont </ORGANIZATION> also said the substitutes `` are going to be more difficult to produce than the existing product.''

<HEAD>White Chocolate Likely to Be on Candy's Cutting Edge in the 90s</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 White chocolate will be the hot chocolate of the'90s, food experts at a convention of chefs say. The drink of choice at coffeehouses and ski lodges soon may be white chocolate cappuccino. Europeans have enjoyed white chocolate for years, but the confection has gone largely ignored in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Because federal regulations forbid the term `` white chocolate,'' manufacturers were wary of marketing the candy. The success of <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION>'s White Alpine candy bar, introduced in 1985, has changed all that. <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, editor of the Florida-based New Product News, named white chocolate as one of the top 15 new food trends during this week's International Association of Food Professionals convention. `` It's the last unexplored avenue in the chocolate world,'' said <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Wald </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> editor of Chocolatier magazine and author of a white chocolate cookbook. `` White chocolate was the last stone unturned.'' <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>'s cookbook contains recipes for white chocolate waffles, white chocolate pound cake, white hot chocolate, white chocolate bread pudding and white chocolate German cake. `` It's a big hit now,'' said <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> <PERSON> Echendia </PERSON>, co-publisher of The Confectioner, a national trade publication. `` It's a new taste that has n't been around before.'' White chocolate, introduced in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> after World War I, comes from the cocoa bean and differs from milk chocolate and dark chocolate only in that it lacks a liquid chocolate extract, the substance that gives standard chocolate its `` bitter, sharper flavor,'' according to chocolate experts. `` It has many of the flavor notes of milk chocolate but it has a lighter, cleaner taste,'' said <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, a vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, where the 40-cent Alpine White with Almonds bar has become one of the top-selling 25 candy bars in the country. <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION> circumvented the white chocolate definition problem by describing the contents of the bar as `` what Europeans call ` white chocolate''' on the back of the label. Otherwise, it's referred to only as `` Alpine White.'' `` I would n't be surprised if deep down inside, people think it has less calories than other chocolate,'' said <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>. `` It looks so pristine and white. It's one of the biggest successes in the candy world.'' <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION> also sells white chocolate chips, white chocolate-coated ice cream bars and bulk white chocolate for individual consumers and candy manufacturers. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> attributed the popularity of white chocolate to a general trend among consumers for `` lighter food.'' `` You're seeing a move away from harder brown liquors to rum and vodka, you'll be seeing lighter soft drinks, people are eating more fish and chicken than beef,'' he said. `` We have some research showing that thewhite color and cleaner taste is appealing.'' <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> also has a theory about why people like white chocolate. `` I love the texture, it's exceptionally creamy and rich,'' she said. `` That's what good desserts are all about. Otherwise, eat an apple.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> personnel using chemical solvents cleaned up the second oil spill in <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> in a month, a spokesman said Friday. A half-mile-long oil slick had spread from a leak in the Peruvian research vessel Humboldt after it ran aground at the entrance to <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cove </LOCATION> on King <PERSON> George </PERSON> island before midnight Sunday. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Lt. <PERSON> Cristian </PERSON> <PERSON> Carbone </PERSON>, speaking from <ORGANIZATION> Punta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arenas </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, said the chemical solvents used by personnel from the Chilean vessel <PERSON> Yelcho </PERSON>, `` worked just fine.'' `` The slick was very light, and the problem has been taken care of,'' <PERSON> Carbone </PERSON> said. He said frogmen from the <PERSON> Yelcho </PERSON> as well as nearby Uruguayan and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> stations sealed the Humboldt's two damaged oil tanks and fuel was no longer leaking. Chilean and Argentine personnel, as well as officers from the <LOCATION> Humboldt </LOCATION>, are preparing to float the ship, which is wedged onto a flat rock and sand surface, the navy spokesman said. The <PERSON> Humboldt </PERSON> was not seriously damaged, <PERSON> Carbone </PERSON> said. On Jan. 28, an Argentine navy ship, the <LOCATION> Bahia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paraiso </LOCATION>, ran aground off the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> peninsula creating a major oil slick, which was cleaned in an operation involving ships from <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A parole board denied early release Friday to <PERSON> Bernhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON>, who is serving a one-year jail sentence for illegally possessing the gun he used to shoot four teen-agers on a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> subway in 1984. A short statement by the state <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parole </ORGANIZATION> said releasing <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> after just two months `` would deprecate the seriousness of the crime and undermine respect for the law.'' <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Elwin </PERSON>, executive director of the parole board, said the decision means <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> has to serve his full sentence minus any time off for good behavior, unless he gets a court to overturn the board's ruling. <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> could have been released Monday if the board had ruled the other way, said <PERSON> Elwin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> is `` angry. He's frustrated,'' said his lawyer, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. `` He does n't belong there.'' `` It's probably one of the most political decisions that's ever come down the pike,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` Anybody in power is afraid to do something that favors <PERSON> Bernhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> for fear of being labeled a racist by the fringe elements. So he sits and rots.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the decision might be appealed. <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON>, 41, was convicted on the gun charge, but acquitted of attempted murder, assault and reckless endangerment charges. The case drew international attention. Some people called the white radio technician a racist vigilante for shooting four black young men who were merely panhandling. Supporters hailed <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> as a hero who resisted a robbery. In turning <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> down for parole, the board noted that <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> had fired his gun repeatedly. `` It is clear from the record that the present one-year sentence for this Class-D felony, which can have a maximum sentence of seven years, was imposed after careful and thoughtful consideration of the circumstances of the case and the subject's background,'' said the board's statement. <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> began serving his sentence Jan. 13 after appeals in the state courts failed to reverse his conviction. On Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> also refused to reverse it. Had <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> not appealed his conviction, he probably would have ended up serving considerably less time in jail. While upholding the conviction, state appeals courts also ruled that <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> had been sentenced incorrectly. The trial judge had given him six months. At his court-ordered re-sentencing, <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> was given the one-year term. <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> is serving his sentence in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Rikers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> jail, where he has been repairing radios for the police and fire departments. <PERSON> Elwin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> got the standard treatment the parole board gives city jail inmates. One member, whom he would not identify, reviewed the prisoner's record and letters sent in by the judge, prosecutor and defense lawyers, <PERSON> Elwin </PERSON> said.

 Labor Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Friday that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will veto any attempt to raise the minimum wage beyond the administration's goal of $ 4.25 an hour at the end of three years, and unless the legislation includes a `` training wage'' for all newly hired workers. Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s blunt warning came as she formally presented the plan to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, setting the administration strongly against a plan by Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., and majority Democrats that would raise the hourly minimum to $ 4.65 She contended the Democratic plan, similar to one that died under opposition by then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> last year, would cost 650,000 jobs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan would raise the $ 3.35 minimum wage, unchanged since 1981, by 30 cents an hour a year until it reaches $ 4.25 an hour in 1991. All new workers hired at the minimum could be paid $ 3.35 an hour for the first six months of their employment. `` Any more expansive approach at this time would be unacceptable because it would decrease job opportunities,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. `` Legislation outside these parameters would call for a veto.'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> told Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> he hoped that `` we're not getting hit with a take it or leave it.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said bluntly, `` The president has signed up for $ 4.25 an hour. and not higher. `` $ 4.25 is it,'' she said, waving her hand. The Labor committee will consider the bill <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> introduced with <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, who has said he wants a floor debate and vote on the question by the end of the month. Under the `` training wage,'' all workers hired at the minimum could be paid $ 3.35 an hour for six months before they are covered by the higher standard. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and other key Democrats and organized labor have opposed setting a lower standard for any workers, which organized labor fears could cause companies to layoff higher-paid workers in favor of those who can be paid less. Twelve states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> have raised the minimum wage in laws that take precedence over the federal standard inside their borders, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> have the highest minimum at $ 4.25 an hour, although <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> has a $ 4.85 floor for some workers.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> announced political initiatives Friday to help heal the ethnic rift with rebellious Sikhs in the prosperous farming state of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, news reports said. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> said he will free most people detained in the 1984 army raid on the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>; rescind legislation allowing detention without trial; and allow foreigners to travel around most of northwestern <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state. Opposition and ruling party legislators, including some who support Sikh militants, loudly thumped their desks in a traditional expression of approval when <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> announced the initiatives in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> agency said. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> gave no time frame for the measures, Indian TV said. `` This is a step in the right direction.

Referring to the release of the <LOCATION> Jodhpur </LOCATION> detenus, so called because most were detained in <LOCATION> Jodhpur </LOCATION> jail in <LOCATION> Rajasthan </LOCATION> state after the temple raid, <PERSON> Dhindsa </PERSON> said `` other innocent people in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> jails should also be released.'' Some 300 people were arrested in the Golden Temple complex during the 1984 army raid ordered by <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s mother, assassinated Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>. Most were pilgrims held for questioning for complicity with Sikh militants who were holed up inside the temple complex. About 150 still are detained, many without charge. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> said all except those who face specific criminal charges will be released soon, <ORGANIZATION> UNI </ORGANIZATION> said. Foreigners will be permitted regular access to <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> and barred only from areas declared severely `` disturbed'' or overrun by militants, <ORGANIZATION> UNI </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> as saying. Presently, all foreigners except accredited journalists need special permission to visit <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> also said he will rescind special provisions of the National Security Act allowing people in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> to be detained without charge for six months, <ORGANIZATION> UNI </ORGANIZATION> said. He told legislators the government also will curtail emergency powers given police under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities Act, the news agency said. Village defense forces will be revived, <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> said, so people rely less on police for help against militants. Village-level elections will be held between May and September, <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> said, and committees based on the elections will supervise development work and law and order. Sikhs comprise less than 2 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s population, but they are in a slight majority in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s agricultural boom state. Militant Sikhs claim they are discriminated against by a government dominated by the overwhelming Hindu majority, who are 82 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 880 million people. Militants wield enormous clout on the plea they are defending the Sikh religion from being swamped by <LOCATION> Hinduism </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> was shot and killed by two Sikh bodyguards to avenge the assault on the temple that is <LOCATION> Sikhism </LOCATION>'s most holy place. In 1988, the militants killed 2,400 people, mostly Hindus and moderate Sikhs opposed to their campaign for a separate homeland. <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state legislature is suspended and the state is under President's Rule, administered directly by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>.

Scientists have raised concerns about the chemical because it does not break down at lower altitudes and floats into the stratosphere, where it breaks down and interacts with the gaseous veil of ozone that shields against the sun's cancer-causing ultraviolet rays. After scientists detected increasing ozone depletion, the industrial nations agreed in September, 1987 to a pledge of sharp cut in the production of ozone-depleting chemicals _ primarily CFCs but also three halon chemicals _ by the end of 1999. The treaty has been ratified by nearly 40 nations, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, most of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. But it includes a provision that allows additional measures, including a complete ban, if further ozone damage is found. The parties to the treaty are scheduled to consider an accelerated phase out schedule _ which is provided for in the 1987 accord _ at a meeting in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> in early May. The meeting that will begin Sunday in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, attracting representatives from more than 100 nations, is described as a dress rehearsal for the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> session. According to the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> produces roughly one-third of the world's CFCs, with E.I. <ORGANIZATION> DuPont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nemours </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> the world's largest producer. There were 750 million pounds of CFCs produced in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year and about the same amount in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> Dupont </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Dupont </ORGANIZATION>, which accounts for about half of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> production, has announced plans to stop making the chemical, perhaps as early as the mid-1990s and will begin to offer substitutes next year. `` We think in the mid-90s is when we'll see the wide scale introduction of the alternatives,'' said <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Forte </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Dupont </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said in a telephone interview. The manufacturers of packaging for many food containers already have stopped using CFCs as a blowing agent in the formulation of plastics. But industry and <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials have acknowledged continuing problems in developing adequate CFC substitutes for some uses. A substitute for CFCs used widely as a cleaning solvent for computer and electrical equipment has been particularly difficult, suggested industry experts. The EPA is still conducting toxicity tests for a number of the <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> substitutes, said agency spokesman <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>. Ms. Forte at <ORGANIZATION> Dupont </ORGANIZATION> also said thesubstitutes `` are going to be more difficult to produce than the existing product.''

 Novelist <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> said Friday he is disturbed by his own government's criticism of `` The Satanic Verses,'' the book that brought him a death sentence in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, in a call to the office of opposition legislator <PERSON> Paddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashdown </PERSON>, said he believed the British government `` is beginning to play both ends against the middle,'' said an aide to <PERSON> Ashdown </PERSON> who took the call. Iranian President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> predicted his nation would prevail. `` Today the West is not facing our nation, but Islam and the the Islamic nation and this wave will grow by the day,'' the Iranian news agency <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> quoted him as saying at Friday prayers in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s spiritual leader, <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, pronounced <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> a heretic and sentenced him to death on Feb. 14. Iranian clergymen have offered as much as $ 5.2 million to the person who kills <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, 41, a British citizen born in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, and his wife, the American novelist <PERSON> Marianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiggins </PERSON>, have been in hiding under police guard since the sentence was pronounced. `` From now on anyone who wants to write these things, or to make a film out of it will wait for death threats from Moslems who have accepted the Imam's fatwa -LRB- death sentence -RRB- and want to carry it out,'' <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said the crowds interrupted the sermon with chants of `` God is great!'' and `` death to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>!'' The `` Satanic Verses'' affair sundered relations that had only recently been restored. Moderates within the Iranian government have been eager for Western assistance in rebuilding their country after a long war against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, while <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has sought <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s help in gaining the release of three of its citizens held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is also seeking the release of a citizen jailed in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on charges of spying. The affair has cost <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> commercial opportunities. <PERSON> A.G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Plint </PERSON>, managing director of Plint and <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, complained in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> on Friday that his company stands to lose an order worth $ 170,000. One death was reported Friday in clashes between police and anti-Rushdie protests in the northern Indian city of <LOCATION> Srinagar </LOCATION>. Police fired on Moslem demonstrators, killing at least one person and injuring more than 100, authorities said. Foreign Secretary Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> said again Friday that <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s right to free speech was fundamental, but that the book is offensive, and not just to Moslems. `` Freedom of speech is important, even in relation to a book which has plainly caused offense in the Moslem community, and is capable of causing offense to others,'' <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>. In an interview Thursday on <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> emphasized `` that we are not upholding the right of freedom to speak because we like the book,'' and complained that the book `` compares <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Alison </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> affairs researcher in <PERSON> Ashdown </PERSON>'s office who spoke to <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, said the writer `` was worried that being anti-Tory is now equated with being anti-British, because obviously the government has found that there are some anti-government statements in the book.'' Ms. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> said <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> denied <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>'s claim that the book drew comparisons between <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` He wanted Mr. <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> to show him any sentence in his book that warranted a comparison to <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>,'' she said. <PERSON> Ashdown </PERSON>, leader of the 19 Social and <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> in the 650-seat <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>, said he shared <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s concern. `` In my view, the government is now shifting ground, and it is a matter of, I think, the deepest and gravest concern, that this government, supposed to be a government in favor of the freedom of liberty, is not prepared to stand up and defend, it appears to me, the most basic freedom of all, which is the freedom of speech,'' <PERSON> Ashdown </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> told BBC-TV she understood that Moslems had been hurt, just as Christians had been `` deeply hurt'' by some things directed at them. However, she said, `` I think that these great religions are strong enough and deep enough to withstand these kind of events.'' On Thursday, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said it had rejected Iranian proposals for a meeting to discuss the crisis, and that no meeting was possible until <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> renounced violence. In other developments Friday: _ In <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, police lobbed tear gas and charged with batons into demonstrators who tried to raid <ORGANIZATION> Dhaka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s British-owned library No injuries were reported. _ About 6,000 Moslems staged a peaceful anti-Rushdie demonstration outside the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Hague </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, police said. _ In <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, about 400 Moslem protesters burned the British flag and a picture of <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> after prayers at <LOCATION> Istanbul </LOCATION>'s biggest mosque, the <ORGANIZATION> Anatolia </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported.

 Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> and White House Budget Director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> met with congressional leaders Friday in a renewed effort to open negotiations on President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s $ 1.16 trillion spending plan After the two hours of closed-door talks, Democratic leaders indicated that they believed serious discussions would begin perhaps as soon as next week. Since <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> unveiled his budget on Feb. 9, he has been pushing to start bargaining talks with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on a 1990 spending plan in order to assure financial markets that progress is being made in reducing the budget deficit, which is expected to hit $ 170 billion this year. <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> had refused to say whether they would be willing to bargain with the administration, insisting instead that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> needed to spell out in greater detail the spending cuts he would seek in order to reduce the 1990 deficit below $ 100 billion. While <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> has been meeting for the past three weeks with members of the budget committees, those sessions have been described as fact-finding talks in which the Democrats were searching for the fine print in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> budget. Democrats have been insisting that the administration spell out some $ 10 billion in unspecified savings <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is seeking in scores of domestic programs in order to meet his deficit reduction goals. Democrats have complained that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has wanted to take credit for boosting spending in such areas as education and the war on drugs while making the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> take the blame for cutting programs or boosting taxes to pay for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s increases. On Friday, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, D-Calif., said he believed the fact-finding phase of the discussions was essentially at an end and it would now be up to <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to decide whether to authorize direct negotiations with the administration <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON> characterized Friday's discussions as a talk about what format the actual bargaining should take and who should participate. `` It would be fair to say that there is some movement toward beginning negotiations with the administration,'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Tenn </LOCATION>., told reporters after the meeting `` We have still got some hoops to go through before we get into negotiations, but I am hopeful,'' <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON> said. Both <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON> and <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON> stressed that they viewed the effort to draft a 1990 budget as a two-track process involving both the normal congressional committee hearings and the negotiations with the administration. `` In the event that these negotiations are unsuccessful, then we could carry on with the budget process and hit our targets -LRB- for completing work on a budget -RRB- as required by statute,'' <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON> said. April 15 is the deadline for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to produce an initial budget resolution establishing broad spending guidelines for the 1990 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1. Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said that `` time is running out so some decisions will have to be made.'' He said various options had been explored but no final decisions were made at the Friday meeting. <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> walked past reporters without pausing to answer questions. While <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> has been meeting on a regular basis with ranking Democrats and Republicans on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> budget committees, it was the first time that <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> had gone to the Capitol to participate in the talks. <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> last week predicted in a meeting with reporters that serious talks would begin within two weeks, in part because the Democrats would realize that the sessions would prove to be to their benefit. House Majority Leader <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., who also participated in the discussions Friday, said: `` We are nearing the end of one phase of the discussions and looking at the next step.

 A group opposed to the death penalty said Friday it gave <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials petitions with more than 1 million signatures denouncing such punishment and asking clemency for a woman on death row in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is considering an appeal of the murder conviction of <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, 19, who is held at the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Women </LOCATION>'s Prison in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> Ms. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> was 15 in 1985 when she and three other teen-agers from <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, robbed and killed <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelke </PERSON>, a 78-year-old retired Bible teacher. Ms. <PERSON> Pelke </PERSON> was stabbed at least 30 times with a butcher knife. `` Thou Shalt Not Kill,'' an Italian anti-death penalty group, presented petitions with more than 1 million signatures appealing for mercy for Ms. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials. Members of the group say they have also sent more than 2 million signatures gathered throughout <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> officials, including an appeal Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> issued in 1987. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> does not issue appeals for clemency in death penalty cases unless they involve political crimes or violations of human rights. The Italians conceded Ms. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>'s case did not fit those categories. Roman Catholics and some leftist groups in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> have adopted Ms. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> as the figurehead of their campaign against capital punishment. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> also have called for mercy. `` We're talking about a girl in the flower of her youth, in the prime of life,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Germano </PERSON> <PERSON> Greganti </PERSON>, the president of `` Thou Shalt Not Kill.'' `` In a sense, it's the defense of the ultimate person _ an adolescent, someone who needs the support of family and the political structure to complete her growth,'' said <PERSON> Greganti </PERSON>. <PERSON> Greganti </PERSON> also noted that Ms. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> is black, `` and black people have been subject to a great deal of intolerence and discrimination.'' `` She has murdered someone,'' said <PERSON> Paolo </PERSON> <PERSON> Pietrosanti </PERSON>, another member of the group, `` but we also say that the most vile homicide is that which is perpetrated and premeditated by the largest number of people. `` This premeditated homicide itself is the death penalty,'' <PERSON> Pietrosanti </PERSON> said. Members of `` Thou Shalt Not Kill'' met with <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> for three hours in her <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> prison cell this week. When Ms. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> was sentenced, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> law allowed the death penalty for anyone over the age of 10 convicted of murder. The age limit has since been raised to 16, but was not made retroactive. As of Feb. 1, 27 people awaited execution in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for crimes they committed before reaching age 18. Ms. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> and <PERSON> Troy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dugar </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> are the only condemned prisoners who committed their crimes before age 16.

<TEXT>
 Mayor <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> ruled out halting new city building projects Friday in reaction to a <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that voided <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s program to encourage minority-owned contractors. `` We will do what we have to do on a case-by-case basis without minority regulation,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. `` I hope we can continue to do business together.'' Young, a longtime civil rights leader, cited decades of slavery and segregation in likening the stricken <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> plan to the Marshall Plan that helped <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> back to its feet after World War II. `` We ca n't help but begin to see that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> legacy has come home to roost,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. He said the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> program, which set a goal of 35 percent minority participation in city contracts, had been aimed at `` full participation'' by all sectors of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said at a news conference there was no need for a moratorium on contracts because most of the major projects he had planned in his nearly eight years in office already are under way. The <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled 7-0 Thursday that <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Minority-Female </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> program was unconstitutional and that the city's defense of the 14-year-old program was `` woefully inadequate. It said there was insufficient evidence of past discrimination. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said Friday that the guidelines were drawn and implemented `` in the implicit spirit of fairness'' to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s black majority. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said there would be no appeal to federal courts, but the city might seek clarifications or modifications at the state level. Thursday's ruling followed the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision in January to overturn a set-aside program in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` We never had quotas, we never had set-asides. We simply had goals,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. `` We had a flexible approach we felt was quite different from <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>.'' Last year, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> awarded $ 29.4 million to minority-owned and operated companies, 36.7 percent of all city contracting business. More than $ 300 million in city business has gone to minority companies since the 35 percent minority participation goal was established in 1975. The court found that the program was too broadly drawn and that the city failed to consider alternatives to a yearly minority participation goal in its contracting. In overturning an earlier <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that upheld the program, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> indicated that <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> could have used milder measures in its affirmative action efforts but did not fully explore them. The high court's ruling was on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Subcontractors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, whose attorney, <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>, praised the court's decision. `` That program is illegal as of right now,'' <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> said. It was not immediately clear whether the ruling effectively dismantles the program. Young said city experts needed time to study the ruling. Some city business leaders expressed optimism that <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s biracial business climate would survive the ruling `` The program allowed us to develop certain relationships,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordy </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> AMC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mechanical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contractors </ORGANIZATION>, one of the partners in the construction of the Underground <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> entertainment complex. `` Those relationships will go on. People will continue to do business as we have.'' <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION> and DeKalb counties, which include parts of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, have goals of 20 percent minority participation in county contracts. Their programs were not affected by the ruling Thursday, but the <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> program is being challenged in federal court.

<HEAD>City Named For Andropov Gets Back Original Name</HEAD>

 Communist Party officials removed <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Andropov </PERSON>'s name from a city north of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said Friday, making him the latest former leader whose name has been wiped off Soviet maps. Residents of the city 150 miles north of the capital had asked that <ORGANIZATION> Rybinsk </ORGANIZATION> assume its original name, the official news agency said. A Soviet atlas published in 1986 lists the city by the name of <ORGANIZATION> Rybinsk </ORGANIZATION>, with `` Andropov'' in parenthesis. <PERSON> Andropov </PERSON> headed the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> until <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> died in 1982, when he became <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader. He was a mentor of President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> until his death in 1984, when he was succeeded by <PERSON> Konstantin </PERSON> <PERSON> U. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chernenko </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, the Supreme Soviet Presidium and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> government reversed their 1984 decision naming the city after <PERSON> Andropov </PERSON>. <PERSON> Andropov </PERSON> has not been widely attacked in the official media under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. In January 1988, a city, squares and a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> neighborhood were stripped of the name <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, who is now blamed for stagnation and bloated bureaucracy. In December, <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> officials ordered the names of <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chernenko </PERSON> wiped off their homes and any other towns, schools or factories that still bore their name. Associates of former Soviet leader <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> also have had their names removed from cities and squares. Western diplomats disagreed about whether there is any significance to the move in a society where place names are being changed because of political disgrace and also to reinstate more popular, historic names eliminated without the approval of residents. `` It's a major change in the leadership's approach to <PERSON> Andropov </PERSON>,'' said a high-ranking Western diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` This is the first concrete indication'' that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is in `` political trouble'' because he was <PERSON> Andropov </PERSON>'s protege, he said. But he also said the name change also may be part of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s rejection of a cult of personality for former leaders Another Moscow-based Western diplomat said the change could be part of a general move in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to give back cities their traditional names. `` I'm surprised if it is a criticism of <PERSON> Andropov </PERSON> _ it seems rather odd,'' he said.

<HEAD>CBO Puts Cost of Bush Bailout at $360 Billion over 30 Years</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s savings and loan bailout plan would cost taxpayers more than twice the $ 40 billion forecast by the administration over the next 11 years, plus an additional $ 20 billion if interest rates do n't fall sharply, the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> estimated Friday. Including interest on money <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would borrow to pay off depositors in 800 S & amp; Ls already insolvent or near insolvency, taxpayers will pick up 70 percent of the estimated $ 360 billion tab over three decades, acting <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Blum </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Blum </PERSON>, however, said that the total bill could go much higher if: _ Interest rates do not fall dramatically, as the administration predicts _ The number of insolvent institutions grows beyond the 300 dealt with over the last two years, the 350 that are now insolvent but still in business and 150 more expected to become insolvent `` in the next year or so. _ Deposit growth in <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls does n't return to the 7 percent annual rate experienced so far this decade Sen. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, D-Mich., the <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, complained that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s rescue package is open-ended with no cap on what taxpayers eventually might have to pay `` There's a question of honesty in dealing with the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people,'' he said. `` The mechanism being proposed says we're asking you to sign a blank check today and we'll fill in the numbers later. It could be any figure.'' But <PERSON> Blum </PERSON> said he saw no alternative. `` These are losses that have already been incurred by the government,'' he said, referring to federal guarantees of up to $ 100,000 each for covering depositors against losses. White House Budget Director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> had told the committee Thursday that the cost to taxpayers of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal would be $ 39.9 billion from 1989 through 1999, assuming that interest rates decline by 5 percentage points over the next five years. <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, however, conceded that taxpayers could be stuck with up to a $ 50.6 billion share of the pre-2000 costs of the package if interest rates are 2 to 3 percentage points higher, as congressional budget experts predicted they would be. Using the optimistic White House expectations on interest rates, <PERSON> Blum </PERSON> estimated the taxpayer costs of the bailout over the next 11 years at $ 84 billion, including $ 16 billion in interest costs to the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> not included in the administration's cost estimates. If interest rates fall just 2 to 3 percentage points, instead of the 5 percentage points predicted by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Blum </PERSON> said, that would add $ 20 billion to the estimated $ 84 billion in costs to taxpayers by 1999. Slower annual deposit growth, in the range of 4 percent to 5 percent instead of the 7 percent assumed in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan, would add $ 5 billion to the tab, he said. Altogether, using White House assumptions about interest rates and deposit growth, the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> put the total bailout tab at $ 205 billion over the next 11 years _ about one-third higher than administration figures.

 President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> said the military committed human rights abuses after seizing power in a 1973 coup, but he blamed the abuses on leftist foes of his authoritarian government. The 73-year-old president and army commander made his surprising comment during a speech Thursday night in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Varas </LOCATION>, 620 miles south of <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>. The Pinochet government has been accused of widespread human rights abuses, including torture and killing of hundreds of dissidents. The Roman Catholic church and local and foreign human rights organizations have documented the cases of at least 700 dissidents who disappeared after being arrested by security agents. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> and other government officials repeatedly denied the accusations, calling them part of a communist-inspired propaganda campaign. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s speech was carried Friday by <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> radio stations, but pro-government newspapers did not carry the quotes related to the human rights issue in full. `` They accuse us of human rights abuses, they talk about killings,'' <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> said. `` I do not say the contrary, there were excesses from both sides.'' He added: `` But who encouraged them? We did n't. They did. It was their fault.'' <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON>, president of <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s independent <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, called <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s speech `` positive.'' But, he added, `` there is a contradiction, when he now admits the abuses he used to deny, but at the same time blames them on those who were the victims of such abuses.'' <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> said the armed forces had to act against `` more than 15,000 guerrillas'' when he led the bloody 1973 coup that toppled the elected government of President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, an avowed Marxist. <PERSON> Allende </PERSON> died in the takeover. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> said that after the coup the military found illegal arms caches `` big enough to arm 35,000 men.'' He said the country had been driven `` to the brink of civilian war.'' After the coup, thousands of leftists were rounded up. Human rights groups, including the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, say many were tortured, jailed or sent into exile. An unspecified number were killed. Others were officially reported killed in clashes with security forces. In 1978, the <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> government issued an amnesty favoring those responsible for abuses after the coup. Opposition leaders say they plan to investigate the abuses after <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> steps down next year and punish `` those found guilty of having committed crimes.'' <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> is due to hand over power March 11, 1990 to the winner in a presidential election scheduled Dec. 14.

<DATELINE>ZAHRANI, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The commander of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Moslem army units sent about 500 soldiers and 10 aging Soviet-designed tanks Friday to south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, where he has said he expects `` an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> operation at any time.'' The 3,000 Lebanese soldiers already in the south are not equipped with tanks. they have stayed out of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s fight with <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> and Shiite Moslem guerrillas in the area. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> maintains a `` security zone'' just inside <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> with the aid of a predominantly Christian surrogate militia. Its military command refused comment Friday on the Lebanese troop movements, but a spokesman said the `` army is doing everything to secure its northern border.'' Two Israeli jet fighters flew reconnaissance as the mechanized battalion moved to <PERSON> Zahrani </PERSON>, 35 miles south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Palestinian and <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> militia gunners fired at them but no hits were reported. Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Sami </PERSON> <PERSON> Khatib </PERSON>, who commands the Moslem units of the divided Lebanese army, said in an interview this week he would send reinforcements south to fight <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and cooperate with <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping troops in the area. He said he expected an Israeli operation soon and `` we'll fight and try to hamper the enemy's advance as much as we can.'' The soldiers who arrived Friday deployed around the <PERSON> Zahrani </PERSON> oil refinery, but a <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> military spokesman said they and their T-54 tanks would move to <LOCATION> Zaghdraya </LOCATION>. The inland town, 12 miles from the Israeli zone, is the army's most forward position in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Khatib </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> soldiers would help the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> enforce Security Council Resolution 425. The resolution, passed after an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> invasion in 1978, calls for the unconditional withdrawal of Israeli forces and deployment of the 5,800-member force along the border. <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION>, whose area of operations overlaps the buffer zone, has not been able to move to the border because the Israelis will not pull back. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> again in June 1982 and established the security zone after withdrawing most of its troops three years later. Lebanese soldiers have been caught in crossfire several times but have not fought a major engagement with Israeli for more than 16 years. The army did not confront the Israelis in either invasion. <PERSON> Khatib </PERSON> commands 22,000 soldiers based in Moslem territory south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and along the coast, and Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> has 20,000 Christian troopers in the Christian area north and east of the capital. The army divided when Moslem militias drove <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> units from Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in February 1984, nine years after <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s sectarian civil war began <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> technically commanded the entire army, however, until a deadlock on the presidential succession created two governments last fall. President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>'s six-year term ended with no successor elected because right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Christians </ORGANIZATION> opposed candidates chosen by neighboring <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, the main power broker in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Christian and Moslem governments emerged from the crisis, with the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> cabinet led by <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, a fellow <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> chosen by <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> as caretaker prime minister. Moslems would not accept <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s authority and acting Premier <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, a Sunni Moslem who heads the Moslem cabinet, named <PERSON> Khatib </PERSON> commander of Moslem army units. By longstanding agreement, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s president is <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION>, the premier Sunni and the Parliament speaker Shiite Moslem. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, which has 40,000 soldiers in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, supports <PERSON> Khatib </PERSON>'s command

<TEXT>
 Political handicappers tried Friday to come up with an early line after an election canvass sent veteran campaigner <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON> to the post as the final entry in this city's three-way mayoral race <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON>, a former alderman who announced himself as a write-in candidate just six days before Tuesday's mayoral primary, became the apparent Republican winner after a canvass Thursday by the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commissioners </ORGANIZATION>. The canvass showed him with 11,621 votes to 10,478 for <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sohn </PERSON>, the endorsed <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidate, who conceded Friday. The board is expected to make it official next week. The results set up a three-way battle in the April 4 mayoral election, pitting <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON> against <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> and independent candidate <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>. <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON> and <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> are white and <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> is black. Political observers saw <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> as the early favorite, with <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> second and <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON> third. `` <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> will win, but it might be closer than most people think,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Royko </PERSON>, the Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist and veteran political observer of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>. `` The thing that's hard to gauge right now is what eventual impact of <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON> will be on <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>. Both men are white, and whatever votes he skims off, will come from <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>,'' he said Friday. `` But it wo n't be enough for <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>.'' Asked to predict the outcome, <PERSON> Royko </PERSON> said <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> would collect 46 percent of the vote, followed by <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> with 44 percent and <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON> with 10 percent. Four other well-known <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> political analysts agreed with that order of finish _ professors <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Loyola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleppner </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, popular black radio personality <PERSON> Lu </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> and Republican official <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Roesser </PERSON>. `` With <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> having won the primary, <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Evans </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- wo n't have much of a chance,'' said <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>. `` The primary winner already has all the money and more is going to flock to him. `` <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON>'s not going to have much of an impact. Why should white voters cross over and vote for <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON>? They've already got their candidate.'' Formal polls assessing the candidates' chances have not yet been released since the three entries in the race were certain. <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, who beat Mayor <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> in the Democratic primary and moved one step closer to attaining the office held 21 years by his legendary father, extended his <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> vacation to a third day Friday. His campaign manager, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Axelrod </PERSON>, dismissed <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON> as a threat, saying, `` He does not strike fear in anyone's heart.'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, trying to stretch his existing campaign funds and raise more, scrambled to tape three television shows for weekend broadcast and scheduled seven appearances around the city. He picked up the endorsement of the 28,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON>, an alderman and Democratic county chairman before converting to the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> some 18 months ago, appeared on two talk shows on predominantly black radio stations. Some callers criticized <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON> for his staunch <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> opposition during the tenure of the late <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>, the city's first black mayor. One suggested <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON> entered the race to extract a reward from <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> in exchange for dropping out. <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON> denied the charge, then added, `` You have the typical Democratic viewpoint that you can negotiate anything.''

 The army is training special units to deal exclusively with the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising so that other soldiers can perform duties elsewhere, the army weekly <ORGANIZATION> Bamahane </ORGANIZATION> reported in its latest issue. The troops will undergo basic infantry training, followed by training on armored personnel carriers. They will then take a new anti-uprising course, the newspaper said. If a war broke out, the units would serve as mechanized infantry, <PERSON> Bamahane </PERSON> said. `` Their year will consist of nine months of security duty in the territories and three months of mechanized infantry training,'' Col. M, personnel chief of the army's ground forces, was quoted as saying. His full name was not released, in keeping with military regulations. Senior army officials have complained that dealing with the 15-month uprising in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> has severely affected the army's training program. Many reserve and regular units, instead of training, have been sent to patrol the occupied territories. In addition, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> alleged last month that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s failure to train professional riot control forces led to an increase in casualties When the revolt broke out Dec. 8, 1987, soldiers were sent to deal with stone-throwing demonstrators without helmets, clubs or sufficient amounts of tear gas. Many of the Arab deaths have since been blamed on army reservists or teen-age recruits inexperienced in civilian riot control. In the last 15 months, at least 388 Palestinians have been killed. During the same time frame, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> media say professional police forces such as the Border Police have not killed a single Palestinian. The new `` <PERSON> Allon </PERSON> units'' _ apparently named ofter <PERSON> Yigal </PERSON> <PERSON> Allon </PERSON>, a founder of pre-state elite commando units _ came under attack from both ends of the political spectrum. `` Maybe it will bring the casualties down, but the uprising will not stop,'' said <PERSON> Ran </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, a reserve colonel and a legislator of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is part of a very dangerous process of turning the army and its troops into a colonial police force.'' <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Eitan </PERSON>, a right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> member and former army chief of staff, called the idea of special units `` rubbish.'' `` You do n't need special units, you have to know how to punish,'' he said. `` They think that by changing organization they'll solve the problem,'' <PERSON> Eitan </PERSON> continued. `` Instead of shooting children, we should expel their leaders and give missions to the Jewish settlers.''

<TEXT>
 Half the country's 262 towns and cities were without mayors Friday, the result of a terror campaign by revolutionaries who say municipal chiefs administer <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> designs. `` Fear is human,'' said <PERSON> Armando </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> <PERSON> Sol </PERSON>, mayor of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, in a recent interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` They -LRB- other mayors -RRB- come to me for advice, but I ca n't ask them to be cannon fodder. They have their families to think about. I tell them it's a personal choice.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> says 131 mayors have chosen to resign. Some have been replaced by low-profile `` substitutes'' _ usually a member of the municipal council. Most have simply locked their doors, leaving residents no means of locally registering births and deaths, getting married or complaining about potholes. Marxist-led revolutionaries say mayors are a principal component of the `` U.S.-imposed counterinsurgency campaign.'' A 9-year-old civil war has killed an estimated 70,000 people. <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, a nation of 5 million, is the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>'s biggest recipient of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic and military aid _ about $ 1.5 million per day The rebels say <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s ruling class have sought, through elections, to put a democratic veneer on a state that remains dominated by the military. A big chunk of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid goes to development projects administered by the Salvadoran government through local authorities. Following municipal elections a year ago, the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>, began threatening mayors and insisting they announce their resignations. The guerrillas have assassinated nine mayors. The most recent slaying was in the eastern town of <LOCATION> Sesori </LOCATION> on Nov. 24. During the last two months of 1988, several municipal chiefs a week were taking to the air waves and buying newspaper ads to announce their resignations. At first, the guerrillas concentrated on their `` zones of control'' _ the northern sectors of <LOCATION> Chalatenango </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Morazan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cabanab </LOCATION> provinces where they move freely and enjoy considerable support. But by late last year they were threatening mayors nationwide. Mayor <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguel </LOCATION>, the nation's third-largest city, remains in his post despite two threats last month. `` I'm not challenging the insurgents to kill me,'' <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON>, of the rightist <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, said in an interview. `` I do n't have enemies. I do n't even consider the left my enemy, because serving the people includes serving the left. But the people gave me this post, and only the people can tell me to leave it,'' he said. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> asked the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> to arrange a meeting with local guerrilla leaders so he could ask them `` why I am considered a military target.'' He's still waiting to be contacted. `` Of course I'm afraid. But the support of the people gives me valor,'' he said. The campaign has been condemned by the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> government, the armed forces, and even the Democratic Convergence, a guerrilla-allied leftist electoral front. The rebels, as part of a peace proposal, offered to stop the campaign if the government postponed presidential elections scheduled March 19 and met their demands for security and anti-fraud measures during the vote. The government and rebels have not been able to agree on when, where or how to negotiate on the proposal, which also ecompasses many other issues.

<HEAD>Recruiting Irregularities Lead Marines To Tell 135 Recruits To Forget
It</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Marines have told 135 young people who signed up for the <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> but were not slated to report until later not to bother showing up, because their recruitments were fraudulent and they really were n't qualified, a spokesman said. Word of their release from the <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>' delayed-entry program follows the dismissal of 30 recruits last month from boot camp at <LOCATION> Parris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION> All the dismissals stem from the discovery that high school diplomas were fabricated and criminal and medical records were disregarded by the <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> recruiting station, said <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Maj. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> McLean </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Parris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. Investigators concluded that recruiters signed up young men who were n't qualified in order to meet their recruitment quotas. Records of an additional 20 recruits in the delayed-entry program are being reviewed, he said Friday. <PERSON> McLean </PERSON> said earlier this week that Maj. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eberhart </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> recruiting station, and 15 of his recruiters were relieved of duty and that two additional recruiters received administrative warnings because of the improper recruiting. In all, there are 47 recruiters assigned to <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. None of the young men sent home from boot camp or released from the delayed-entry program faces any disciplinary charges, officials said. The actions follow an investigation triggered by a suburban <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> recruit's claim that his recruiter enlisted him even though he knew the young man had a severe stomach ulcer that should have disqualified him. The recruit had to be hospitalized while at boot camp. <PERSON> McLean </PERSON> said 30 recruits were sent home from boot camp after a review of 83 questionable cases. He told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday that in addition, 135 of nearly 700 recruits in the <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>' delayed-enlistment program were also released `` over the same reasons that the others were disqualified for. The delayed-enlistment program allows recruits to commit themselves to the Corps without reporting to boot camp until up to six months later. Rep. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Walgren </PERSON>, D-Pa., said he met with the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>' congressional liaison and was told the <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> `` have never experienced this widespread a problem in their memory'' with fabricated `` This is a very high number of recruiters in a relatively small pool for them all to be involved in what is clearly a serious violation of rules,'' <PERSON> Walgren </PERSON> said. `` That number suggests they are under extraordinary pressure to produce, or it's something far widespread beyond this recruiting station.'' The head of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> recruiting battalion in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> said Thursday that a surprise inspection in November found six instances of possible improper recruiting. Four recruits were recommended for dismissal and two cases have not been resolved, said Col. <PERSON> Randell </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkes </PERSON>.

 President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> today said whether <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> can continue to make payments on its foreign debt depends on the success of its austerity program. `` The crisis Latin American nations are undergoing has a name written with capital letters _ foreign debt,'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> told foreign correspondents at <ORGANIZATION> Miraflores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palace </ORGANIZATION>, the government headquarters. A newspaper today reported more than 300 people died and and 1,500 were injured since Monday in riots in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> and 11 other cities. The unrest was caused by government-imposed bus fare increases, which appeared to release pent up frustration over the nation's austerity program. Buses and cars circulated in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> today as the capital returned to normal, with early morning traffic jams and honking horns replacing some of the tensions of this week's unrest. Looters emptied the shelves of supermarkets and neighborhood grocery stores in the first days of rioting. Since then, part of the 22,000 police and soldiers ordered on alert in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> have guarded stores, where people have been waiting hours in line to buy such staples as eggs, bread and cheese. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, in a morning news conference, said payments on the country's $ 33 million foreign debt depends on `` how our economic program develops.'' <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, affluent during the 1970s thanks to its rich oil reserves, saw its fortunes slide along with petroleum prices in 1981. Real wages have since then fallen by a third, inflation is expected to double this year to 70 percent, and the $ 33 billion foreign debt is the fourth largest in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> after <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> suspended payments on $ 20.4 billion of the debt in January, and the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nacional </ORGANIZATION> reported last week that payments on another $ 5 billion of the debt was suspended. Earlier this week, the government asked the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> to include provisions allowing <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> to suspend all payments on its debt until September. <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> also asked for an additional $ 4.3 billion in loans from the institution over the next three years. Asked if he intended to delay repayment beyond September, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said it would depend on the success of his economic adjustment program. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, who has been in office for only one month, has blamed leftists for prolonging <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s worst unrest in 31 years of <ORGANIZATION> democratic </ORGANIZATION> rule. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Puerta </PERSON>, a former guerrilla leader, accused the government of inventing political motives for the disturbances, which he blamed on the failure of the government's economic policies. On Thursday evening, soldiers hunting snipers and seeking looters conducted house-to-house searches in downtown <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> and the western slums. Shooting was heard early today as soldiers fired into the air and at buildings to flush out snipers. It appeared the gunfire also was meant to enforce the government's dusk-to-dawn curfew by keeping people off the streets. <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nacional </ORGANIZATION> said in today's edition that more than 300 people had been killed and 1,500 injured in four days of violence _ the bloodiest in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s history. Other reports said the death toll ranged from 250 to 350. The newspaper said its reporters counted 237 bodies at the <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> central morgue and said there were other bodies in hospitals across the city. The dead included at least four children aged 3 to 14. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Reinaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Figueredo </PERSON> said the government is setting up a food-distribution network with supplies airlifted from the rest of the country.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spotted an oil slick off the northern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION> on Friday, but marine reserve officials said the two-mile spill apparently was no immediate threat to the area's popular reefs. The slick, of unknown origin, was 10 to 12 miles off the north Key Largo coast Friday afternoon, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Dye </PERSON>. `` Where it is, it would not be a threat,'' he said. Two or three dead birds were spotted, but it was not clear if they were killed by the oil, <PERSON> Dye </PERSON> said. Officials of two parks off Key Largo _ the <ORGANIZATION> Key </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Largo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennekamp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reef </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> _ sent boats out to survey the area after spotting some tar balls in the waters. `` We have tar balls measuring one-quarter to 4 inches in diameter that are washing near the southern boundary on the park,'' said <PERSON> Pennekamp </PERSON> director <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON>. `` But it is not a big spill. This is a normal occurrence from ships that pass by, and it wo n't have a big effect on the park.'' The 20-mile-long offshore state park, a favorite among divers, stretches north from Molasses Point off the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> shore of Key Largo. The federal Key Largo reserve covers about the same area, but outside the three-mile limit. The slick was first reported to be as large as 10 miles long, 2 miles wide, and as much as 4 feet deep, which would have made it a major spill. But an overflight Friday by a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> marine safety officer discovered the spill was only two miles long and a quarter-mile wide, and in some places was only a light stain. The spill could have been bunker oil released by a ship, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> marine safety office spokeswoman <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Mountcastle </PERSON>.

 The pilot who landed a jetliner after its side ripped open, ejecting nine passengers, said Friday that after the shock he said a quick prayer for his passengers and went back to work. Capt. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> was in charge of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> Flight 811 on its Feb. 24 non-stop flight from <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Auckland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, when shortly after takeoff the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747's right forward cargo door and an adjoining 10-by-10 foot section of fuselage tore away. In addition to the nine people missing, 27 were injured in the turbulence of the sudden decompression and the flight back to <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> said the accident outweighed anything he experienced in the military as a fighter pilot. After realizing the extent of damage to the plane, `` I said a prayer for them -LRB- passengers -RRB- momentarily and got back to business,'' <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> said at a news conference held within earshot of jets taking off and landing at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. First Officer <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Slader </PERSON> said simulated disaster exercises undertaken annually by <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> personnel were important but insufficient for the many problems that faced them. The crew `` reverted almost to survival instincts,'' <PERSON> Slader </PERSON> said. The crewmembers' answers were carefully controlled by airline officials, who prohibited them from answering questions pertaining to concerns about aging aircraft or the investigation of the disaster. <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> was on his next-to-last flight, after 38 years of military and commercial flying and he said he's looking forward to his next _ and final _ flight. Because the flight took off through a fierce thunderstorm, he said he had ordered passengers to keep their seatbelts fastened. Without that precaution, many more lives would definitely have been lost, <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> said. After the accident, the crew members said, they reached for oxygen masks but found the oxygen lines had been severed. <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> said the plane was `` quivering and shuddering'' and he could see flames from one wing. During the 25-minute flight back to <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, the crew had to dump 90,000 pounds of fuel, partly because with only two engines the plane was, in effect, overloaded. In addition, the gaping hole in the side created drag which affected speed and control. Part of the emergency descent procedure for getting the plane back down to breathable air is to lower the landing gear to create drag. But <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> said their decision not to lower the landing gear probably was critical to keeping the big jet from losing altitude too quickly before its remaining engines got it back to the <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> runway. If they had lowered the wheels immediately, there `` would have been a good chance we would have gone in the water,'' he said. The crew also agreed to gradually move landing flaps to angles not normally prescribed to keep the plane in the air. `` I do n't think a 747 has ever flown on two engines at that weight. My concern for being overweight was staying airborne,'' the pilot told the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Second Officer <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said he checked out the passenger area and saw `` no panic at all'' and that none of the passengers were moving. Normal landing speed with all four engines would have been 132 knots. The crew estimated that 170 knots would be safe. <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> said he chose to touch down at 200 knots because he was afraid of losing control of the jet if he slowed it further. Once the plane reached view of <ORGANIZATION> Honolulu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, he said he was confident of the plane's safe landing, which took up two-thirds of the runway because of their speed and not having reverse thrust from all four engines. `` There was a sigh of relief and we started looking after the passengers,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. After all remaining passengers had unloaded, <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> said he and the other two crew members left by way of an emergency chute. They inspected the damage, which he described as `` a hole you could drive a semi-truck through.'' `` My reaction was, I ca n't tell you what my reaction was, like ` Oh, -LRB- pause -RRB- you know what. Oh, dear.'''

 Leftist rebels on Friday called for a boycott of the presidential election scheduled for March 19, saying the vote would aggravate war and poverty. The insurgents have proposed postponement of the election until September. They said if the vote were put off, they would participate and respect its outcome. `` We call on the our people not to vote March 19,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> on its clandestine radio station. Despite more than five weeks of debate on the guerrilla proposal, the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> government and the insurgents have not been able to agree on when, where or how to negotiate its possible implementation. A leftist electoral front on Friday accused the government and the rightist <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, or <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>, of procrastinating in response to the plan. Arena controls the legislature and is favored to win the presidential election. It is adamantly opposed to postponement of the vote. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> are trying to take advantage of the situation for propagandistic electoral ends, thus manipulating the people's desire for peace,'' said the leftist Democratic Convergence. It alleged in a communique that the two parties intend to prevent postponement by stalling until March 19. The leftist alliance proposed rescheduling the election July 9. It also said the government, the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> and representatives of the political parties should meet in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> next week to negotiate an end to the 9-year-old civil war. `` The election of March 19 is designed to sustain the war after the previous five flawed elections have aggravated the original causes of the conflict,'' said the rebels on Radio Venceremos. `` We have proposed to compete in the political sphere, in which clear and clean results would conciliate the parties in conflict in light of the inviability of continuing the war,'' they said. `` But those who have made a living from the war have sought to close the doors to peace.'' `` The elections of March 19 will only aggravate hunger and misery, as they hold out no hope of real solution for the country's crisis,'' the rebels said

 Guatemalan President <PERSON> Vinicio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerezo </PERSON> said Friday political realities are pushing Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> to abandon a `` totalitarian'' blueprint and pursue a democratic outcome for his country. <ORGANIZATION> Cerezo </ORGANIZATION>, who is here for talks with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration and congressional leaders, said <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> `` does n't like democracy. He's trying to make a revolution'' through a `` totalitarian'' formula At the same time, he said, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> has had to pay attention to the demands of other Central American presidents that he embrace democracy, mindful that they would otherwise repudiate him. <ORGANIZATION> Cerezo </ORGANIZATION> spoke at a luncheon sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION>. Based on his discussions here, <ORGANIZATION> Cerezo </ORGANIZATION> said there are considerable doubts among <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials about <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s willingness to comply with the <ORGANIZATION> democratic </ORGANIZATION> promises he made at the recent meeting of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidents in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cerezo </ORGANIZATION> added that he believes these doubts are justified. The administration, he said, wants more assurances that democracy will be established in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in a time period comparable to that of the demobilization of the Contras. Still, he said, he believes the administration is convinced that it should emphasize a diplomatic solution in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> rather than continuing to attempt to solve problems through military force. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> spoke after administration and congressional officials disclosed details of the `` carrot and stick'' approach to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> advocated by Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. The policy includes unspecified rewards for <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> if it passes certain `` checkpoints'' on the road to democracy. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> made clear to lawmakers that he does not intend to abandon the Contra rebels, who now are subsisting on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> supplies in Honduran jungle camps along the Nicaraguan border. He told congressional officials he would seek to renew the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid, which runs out at the end of this month, for a year, according to some present at the Thursday meetings. Aid would continue to flow at current rates _ about $ 4 million a month _ and would keep the rebels available as a standby fighting force until after <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s national elections, which are being moved up to early 1990. At the Central American summit meeting, the five presidents agreed to try to draft a plan that would lead to the demobilization of the Contras in return for open elections in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and the release of most of the 3,300 jailed Contras and former members of the armed forces who served under the <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> family dynasty.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called Friday for banning the production and use of ozone-depleting chemicals by the end of the century if adequate substitutes can be found. His move to protect the world's ozone layer, which shields the earth from much of the sun's cancer-causing ultraviolet rays, came on the heels of a decision Thursday by 12 European countries to pursue a ban on the chemicals instead of only cutting back on production, as the world's industrial nations had earlier agreed to do. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> accounts for about one-third of the production of ozone-damaging chemicals, primarily chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, which are widely used as coolants in refrigerators and air conditioners and as a cleaning agent for electronic and computer equipment. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, had sought the stronger administration position on CFCs before he left Friday for <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, where representatives from more than 100 nations are meeting to discuss the ozone-depletion problem. In remarks at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> to a group of high school science award winners, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said `` recent studies indicate the 50 percent reduction -LRB- of CFCs under existing treaty -RRB- may not be enough.'' The president said he asked <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> to join other nations at the meeting in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to support the call `` for the elimination of CFCs by the year 2000 provided safe substitutes are available.'' <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, according to administration sources, had strongly recommended at a White House meeting Thursday that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> join its European allies and call for the complete elimination of CFCs, as opposed to cutting production by 50 percent as required by current treaty. Under the 1987 treaty, the industrial nations are committed to halving <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> production by the year 2000, but many scientists have said that such a cutback would not be enough to protect against serious ozone depletion. On Thursday, the 12 nations of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> announced in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, that they have agreed to a ban on the chemical in their countries by the end of the century. <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> is known to have wanted to carry a similar commitment with him to the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> conference, which is scheduled to begin Sunday. `` We intend to reaffirm the strong position of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> about chlorofluorocarbon manufacture and use,'' <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said Friday, adding that `` we intend to maintain our leadership'' in dealing with the ozone-depletion problem. Scientists have raised concerns about the chemical because it does not break down at lower altitudes and floats into the stratosphere, where it breaks down and interacts with the gaseous veil of ozone that shields against the sun's cancer-causing ultraviolet rays. After scientists detected increasing ozone depletion, the industrial nations agreed in September 1987 to a pledge of sharp cut in the production of ozone-depleting chemicals _ primarily CFCs but also three halon chemicals _ by the end of 1999. The treaty has been ratified by nearly 40 nations, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, most of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. But it includes a provision that allows additional measures, including a complete ban, if further ozone damage is found. The parties to the treaty are scheduled to consider an accelerated phase-out schedule _ which is provided for in the 1987 accord _ at a meeting in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, in early May. The meeting that will begin Sunday in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, attracting representatives from more than 100 nations, is described as a dress rehearsal for the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> session. According to the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> produces roughly one-third of the world's CFCs, with E.I. <ORGANIZATION> DuPont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nemours </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> the world's largest producer. There were 750 million pounds of CFCs produced in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year and about the same amount in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> Dupont </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Dupont </ORGANIZATION>, which accounts for about half of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> production, has announced plans to stop making the chemical, perhaps as early as the mid-1990s and will begin to offer substitutes next year. `` We think in the mid-90s is when we'll see the wide scale introduction of the alternatives,'' said <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Forte </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Dupont </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said in a telephone interview. The manufacturers of packaging for many food containers already have stopped using CFCs as a blowing agent in the formulation of plastics. But industry and <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials have acknowledged continuing problems in developing adequate CFC substitutes for some uses. A substitute for CFCs used widely as a cleaning solvent for computer and electrical equipment has been particularly difficult, suggested industry experts. The EPA is still conducting toxicity tests for a number of the <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> substitutes, said agency spokesman <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>. Ms. Forte at <ORGANIZATION> Dupont </ORGANIZATION> also said the substitutes `` are going to be more difficult to produce than the existing product.''

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> will offer next week to trim key conventional weapons systems by 5 percent to 10 percent while asking the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> to make even larger cuts, an alliance source said Friday. The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the proposal for cuts in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s main battle tanks, artillery and armored troop carriers would bring those weapons `` substantially beneath'' current levels. `` Since we are convinced that we ... -LRB- are -RRB- pretty much at the minimum of our defense this means for our military people a significant sacrifice,'' said the source, who outlined the plan to reporters at <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> headquarters. The plan also calls for <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nations to slash by more than half their main battle tanks and artillery. The Western alliance contends the Soviets and their allies have built up a huge superiority in conventional, or non-nuclear, weapons in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The alliance wants the East bloc nations to make much greater reductions in their forces to bring the two sides to rough equality. The proposal will be made Thursday when negotiators for the 16 alliance nations and the seven <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> nations begin talks in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> on reducing conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The discussions will cover weapons in the vast region extending from the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Ural </LOCATION> mountains in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The source said main battle tanks, armored troop carriers and artillery were singled out for initial discussion because they can be used in a surprise attack. He would only say <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> was prepared to reduce its holdings in tanks, artillery and armored troop carriers to 90 percent to 95 percent of current levels. The reduction, he said, ranges roughly between 5 percent to 10 percent. Under the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> formula, an overall ceiling will be set of 40,000 main battle tanks _ 20,000 for each side. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> said in a report last year that it has 16,424 such tanks in active units and an additional 5,800 in storage. It estimated the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact total at 51,500 with more than <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s in storage. The <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION>, in a recent count, put its tank total at 59,470 and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s at 30,690. For artillery pieces, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> will propose an overall cap of 33,000, or 16,500 for each side, according to the source. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> estimated its artillery, which includes mortars and multiple rocket launchers, at 14,458 pieces plus an additional 2,870 held in storage. It estimated the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc's at 43,400 with more pieces in storage than that held by the West. The <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact count put its artillery at 71,560 pieces compared to 57,060 for the West. On armored troop carriers, the source said the alliance will suggest an overall limit of 55,000, or 27,500 for each side. It was unclear, though, how that would affect the actual count because neither <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nor the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact has provided breakdowns for those forces. The <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> report said it has 4,153 armored infantry fighting vehicles plus 575 in storage, and that the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact has 22,400 with additional ones in storage. It also said the alliance has 35,351 other armored vehicles, including armored personnel carriers, and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact has 71,000. The <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> counts 70,330 infantry vehicles and armored personnel carriers for the East and 46,900 for the West.

 A Czechoslovak spy arrested last year while receiving secret radio messages from <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> was convicted of espionage on Friday and sentenced to 10 years in prison. <PERSON> Erwin </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Haarlem </PERSON>, 43, whose real identity is still not known to police, posed as a Dutch art dealer and infiltrated Jewish groups while sending information back to his superiors, said the prosecution. It said he was an active agent here for 13 years. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Haarlem </PERSON> pleaded innocent and was convicted by a jury after a five-day trial at the Old Bailey Central Criminal Court. Judge <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> recommended he be deported after serving his sentence. `` I have not the least doubt that you are a dedicated, disciplined and resourceful spy,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Haarlem </PERSON> was recording a coded message when arrested at his north <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> apartment on April 2, 1988, by police from <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard's special branch. Police seized six decoding guides hidden in a bar of soap, materials for `` secret writing'' and a list of locations for depositing and collecting material. Prosecutor <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Amlot </PERSON> told the jury that van <LOCATION> Haarlem </LOCATION> received 210 coded messages from <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> after arriving in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1975. Among his assignments was to find out what firms were participating in proposed `` Star Wars'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space-based defense system, <PERSON> Amlot </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Haarlem </PERSON> joined Jewish organizations such as Conscience, a group devoted to helping Soviet Jews, and the Women's Campaign for Soviet Jewry. After his arrest, van <LOCATION> Haarlem </LOCATION> was taken to a police station where he asked for a message to be relayed to the Czechoslovak Embassy: `` <PERSON> Erwin </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Haarlem </PERSON> has been arrested,'' said <PERSON> Amlot </PERSON>. This was done. The jury was told van <LOCATION> Haarlem </LOCATION> adopted the name of a Dutch child left by his mother in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> after World War II. <PERSON> Amlot </PERSON> said the real van <LOCATION> Haarlem </LOCATION>'s mother searched for and found the Czechoslovak spy in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, and he pretended he was her son. Tests determined he could not have been her child, and she was told this. It was not clear what happened to the real van <LOCATION> Haarlem </LOCATION>.

 Officials on Friday said a West German computer spy ring that sold stolen data to the Soviets represents a new and dangerous dimension in international espionage. `` The illegal entry into hundreds of data systems is an extremely dangerous new threat,'' federal Interior Minister <PERSON> Friedrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> said. `` Governments and businesses must now become extremely vigilant,'' <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> said a day after officials said they had penetrated a ring of `` hackers'' who sold thousands of passwords and codes from military and research computers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to Soviet intelligence agents. <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON>, whose ministry is responsible for counterespionage and domestic intelligence-gathering, called the hackers' operations `` a new dimension of Soviet bloc spy agencies.'' Although he said it was too soon to assess the full extent of the damage, he added the investigation had `` succeeded in dealing a major blow against the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> Soviet secret service.'' <PERSON> Juergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmid </PERSON>, a spokesman for the federal <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, called the incident `` extremely serious, but not drastic.'' `` The hackers were able to gain entry, but failed to penetrate deep into the secret areas of the databanks,'' he said. Security officials Friday said three men were in custody and another five were under investigation. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Prechtel </PERSON>, a spokesman for the federal Prosecutor's Office, said the suspects range in age from 25 to 35 He said several were involved with illegal drugs, but did not elaborate. <PERSON> Prechtel </PERSON> said police in <LOCATION> Hanover </LOCATION> arrested two hackers on `` suspicion of espionage activities for an Eastern European intelligence agency.'' Another suspect was arrested in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, he said. Officials of the federal <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wiesbaden </LOCATION> said more than 100 state officers and federal agents were involved in making the arrests and in subsequent searches of apartments in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hanover </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION>. A West German broadcast network, <PERSON> Norddeutsche </PERSON> <PERSON> Rundfunk </PERSON>, said Thursday the computer networks infiltrated by the hackers included the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s general databank, known as <ORGANIZATION> Optimus </ORGANIZATION>; a <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> and a Strategic Defense Initiative, or `` Star Wars,'' research computer; and computers tied to nuclear weapons and energy research at the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alamos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Fermi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accelerator </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. The network said attempts were made to gain access to the <ORGANIZATION> Lawrence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Berkeley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, which it called a key link in efforts to break into other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> computers. <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoll </PERSON>, an astrophysicist who did research at the laboratory, said up to 50 military computers were broken into through an astronomy computer, but that the hacker did not have passwords for classified information. `` We were amazed. Here's some guy breaking into an astronomy computer in <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, reaching out into military computers trying to search for information about SDI, about nuclear warheads,'' <PERSON> Stoll </PERSON> said in an interview Thursday from his home in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Stoll </PERSON>, who works at the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Astrophysical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said he and other researchers helped break the spy ring. He said someone linked to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc groups wrote the lab asking for related information, leading authorities to the hackers. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bardeen </PERSON>, head of the theory group at <LOCATION> Fermilab </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Batavia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, said Soviets participate in research there. `` So there are Soviet scientists living at <ORGANIZATION> Fermilab </ORGANIZATION> and using the computers. There is n't anything confidential or strategic in the computers,'' <PERSON> Bardeen </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alamos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>, said he knew of no evidence a foreign intelligence agency had gained access to its classified computer system. He said none of the lab's findings were secret <PERSON> Norddeutsche </PERSON> <PERSON> Rundfunk </PERSON> said the three suspects were detained following searches of at least six apartments in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hanover </LOCATION>. According to <PERSON> Norddeutsche </PERSON> <PERSON> Rundfunk </PERSON>, authorities believe the three hackers were recruited by the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 and `` were paid with cash and drugs ... and were later forced to provide the codes and passwords to the Soviets.'' The network said the three handed over information from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> at a 1985 meeting with two <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> agents in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. The hackers obtained information that would allow the Soviets themselves to gain access to the computers and develop technology based on the information, the network said. The information would also give the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> access to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military supply depot statistics and to computers belonging to several European institutes that deal with atomic and aerospace research, the network said. Officials at the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Particle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physics </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> said attempts were made in 1986 and 1987 to gain access to the lab's computers. A laboratory offical, who asked not to be identified, said Soviet and other specialists have been visiting researchers at the facility for years. In <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> officials said the West German hackers had penetrated a <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> computer in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Willy </PERSON> <PERSON> Helin </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, said specialists are trying to determine whether suspected Soviet agents had also gained access to other EEC computer networks. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, a lab official said unknown West German hackers broke into a computer system in a Japanese government research lab in 1985. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> For </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physics </ORGANIZATION> discovered that a research project was penetrated in mid-1985, said lab spokesman <PERSON> Shinichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON>. He said no sensitive information was stolen, and the lab has since heightened security by changing passwords and other measures. He said it was not known if the intruders were part of the alleged West German ring.

 <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s Charter 77 human rights movement has nominated jailed Czech playwright <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> for the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize, an emigre source said Friday. The announcement came one day after 2,000 Hungarians said they would nominate <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> for the prize during a demonstration in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> seeking his freedom. Last month, two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressmen had nominated the playwright, whose works are banned in his own country, for the prize. The London-based publisher <ORGANIZATION> Palach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, which monitors events in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, said a Charter 77 committee would submit the organization's nomination to the Norwegian Nobel Committee in <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION>. The committee is made up of <LOCATION> Czechoslovak </LOCATION> activists, mainly intellectuals, in a bid to publicize the imprisoned dramatist's case and gain support for his nomination for the prestigious prize, <PERSON> Palach </PERSON> <PERSON> Press </PERSON> said. Sen. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>., and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Steny </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyer </PERSON>, D-Md., also nominated <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> on Feb. 1 on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> Helsinki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, a human rights monitoring <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, 52, was convicted last month on charges of incitement and obstructing police for his role in a January rally in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, and he was sentenced to nine months in jail. The January rally honored <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Palach </PERSON>, a student who set himself afire to protest the Soviet-led invasion of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> in 1968. <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, who has appealed his sentence, had previously spent slightly more than four years in jail for his rights campaign. A translation of the Feb. 26 letter, made available to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Palach </PERSON> <PERSON> Press </PERSON>, reads: `` We therefore believe that the Nobel Peace Prize should be awarded primarily to those who, working outside their own profession and often with great personal sacrifice, contribute toward making life on this planet more just and respectable.'' Sources linked to the <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION> committee told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that several proposals exist for <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>'s nomination. He is one of nearly 100 candidates, including several organizations. The announcement of the prize usually comes in September or October.

 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> could be the first Cabinet nominee ever to stand on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor to answer questions from senators face-to-face, an ordeal that reporters were known to undergo during the 19th century. Senate Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> suggested the extraordinary appearance Friday to give the embattled nominee for <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary a chance to answer charges and questions about his personal life. Democratic leaders said they would consider any request. Associate Senate Historian <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON> said no one has been called to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor for questioning in more than 50 years, and only five times that are listed in <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> records. Leaks of secret material to reporters were the target of early grillings on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor and would be again if <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> gets his way. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> suggested Friday that <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> needed a chance to rebut the allegations about his personal life that the Republican leader said were based on biased leaks from the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report on Tower. The first recorded target of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> questioning was <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Duane </PERSON>, editor of the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION> newspaper. <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Duane </PERSON> had written stories about secret <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> deliberations on changing the way electoral ballots were counted, stories based on leaks from senators. But <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON> said <PERSON> Duane </PERSON> left the chamber to talk to his lawyer, fled the Capitol and never returned. Then in 1848 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Nugent </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> was questioned about stories on secret <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> deliberations over a treaty. Thirteen years later, <PERSON> Zebulon </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hiram </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramsdale </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Tribune were hauled before the senators, again to be asked about leaks of secret treaty deliberations. `` No one revealed their sources,'' said <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON>, adding that each of the three reporters was held hostage in <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee rooms to encourage them to cooperate. A more recent example _ cited by <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> _ came in 1933, when the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Sergeant-at-Arms <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> wrote a newspaper article some members found objectionable. `` Not all senators are crooks,'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> wrote, `` Just some of them.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> historian said that <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> was questioned on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor that February, grilled later by a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee and then fired. Then in 1934, three airline officials were called to answer questions about government contracts with airmail carriers. As a former senator, Tower has the right to come to the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, but does not normally have permission to speak to his one-time colleagues. Non-senators have spoken on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor on other occasions, including lawyers defending those charged in impeachment proceedings. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> can, of course, allow anyone to speak to them by voting to do so.

 Former national security adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> was given a suspended sentence and fined $ 20,000 Friday for misleading <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> with assurances that <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> was obeying its ban on helping the Nicaraguan rebels. The former <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant colonel became the first Iran-Contra figure to be punished for his role in the affair. He was sentenced by U.S. District Judge <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> for his guilty pleas to four misdemeanor charges of withholding information from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> suspended imposition of any prison term and instead placed <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> on two years probation and ordered him to perform 200 hours of community service during that time. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> could have received a maximum prison term of four years and a $ 400,000 fine. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> imposed the sentence and fine with little comment after <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Garment </PERSON>, called his client `` an honorable man.'' `` The public servants in this country are not to be found to be more decent and more honorable,'' Garment told the judge. `` Every action on his part ... was taken out of a high sense of duty, a strong sense of serving his country's interests.'' `` He stood up and rendered a faithful accounting of his public responsibilities when called upon to do so,'' Garment said, referring to <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>'s admission in court that he misled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about the Iran-Contra affair. `` Mr. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> and his family have suffered greatly and enough during these past years,'' Garment said, referring to the emotional trauma <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> experienced that culiminated in a suicide attempt several months after the affair was made public. Urging probation, Garment said: `` If ever there were a case that called for this act of discretion, this such a case.'' <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, in his characteristic emotionless monotone, told <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> that `` Clearly, this episode in our history has rendered enormous turmoil on our country's processes.'' `` To the extent that I contributed to that I regret it,'' <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> said of his role in the Iran-Contra affair. `` I tried to serve my country.'' The judge did not elaborate on the reason for his sentence, except to say that `` the nature of the offense and the totality of the circumstances'' required him to impose a $ 5,000 fine for each of the four counts. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said he would make further recommendations about the type of community service he wants <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> to complete during the two years of probation. Independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> did not oppose Garment's request for a suspended sentence Outside the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Courthouse, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> told reporters his office `` made no recommendation'' on the sentence and declined further comment. As he left the courthouse, <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> said he has `` strong faith and a terrific wife and a free country. I am looking to the future. That's all I have to say.'' He had looked tense as he entered the courtroom, walking hand in hand with his wife, <PERSON> Jonda </PERSON>. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said he had carefully read the extensive submissions, including a statement by <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, that were filed with him but which were n't on the public record. The sentencing occurred in the same courthouse where <PERSON> North </PERSON>, <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>'s former aide, is standing trial on 12 felony counts arising from his involvement in the Iran-Contra affair. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> is expected to be a key prosecution witness against <PERSON> North </PERSON> and had asked to be sentenced by <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> before he testifies in the Iran-Contra trial. On March 11, 1988, <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> pleaded guilty to four misdemeanor counts of withholding information from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and agreed to cooperate with <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s investigation of the Iran-Contra affair. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> admitted writing three letters in 1985 assuring two House committees that <PERSON> North </PERSON> was not helping raise money for the Nicaraguan Contras or providing military assistance in defiance of a ban on such aid that was imposed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> admitted to a fourth count of misleading the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Dec. 8, 1986 by denying any knowledge of efforts to solicit money from foreign countries to help the Contras after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> cut off <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid. Among the 12 felony charges against <PERSON> North </PERSON> are allegations that he drafted the three 1985 letters for <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>'s signature that were sent to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Permanent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Affairs subcommittee on <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION> affairs. In opening statements at <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s trial on Feb. 22, defense lawyer <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> complained that the former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide `` is charged with crimes for letters that his boss sent.'' `` <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> decided to write them, but the government wants you to convict <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> for them,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said, suggesting that <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> faces tough cross-examination when he testifies against <PERSON> North </PERSON>. Prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> told jurors in his opening statement that <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> `` is still reluctant to take the responsibility for what happened'' and `` is going to blame <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> for lying to him.'' Each of the four misdemeanor charges that <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> pleaded guilty to carried a maximum one-year prison term and a fine of up to $ 100,000. The two letters that <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> wrote to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> intelligence committee on Sept. 5, 1985 and Oct. 7, 1985, were in response to the panel's inquiries about news reports that <PERSON> North </PERSON> was helping raise money for the Contras and providing military advice. In one letter, <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> wrote: `` I can state with deep personal conviction that at no time did I or any member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> staff violate the letter or the spirit of the law.'' `` We did not solicit funds or other support for military or paramilitary activities either from Americans or third parties,'' he wrote. Rep. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, D-Ind., the intelligence committee's former chairman, testified as the first witness in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s trial, telling jurors that he relied on the information that <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> gave him `` I certainly relied upon the information given to me by the national security adviser of the president,'' <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> testified. `` I thought that information was accurate, honest and correct,'' he said. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, who tried to commit suicide in 1987 by taking an overdose of a tranquilizer, played a major role in the Iran-Contra affair after resigning as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s national security adviser in late 1985. He led a secret mission to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> in 1986 in an unsuccessful attempt to trade weapons for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostages. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, who accompanied <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> on the mission, carried a key-shaped cake and a Bible signed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. He also testified without immunity from prosecution during the televised congressional hearings on the Iran-Contra affair in 1987.

 About 2,000 students, protesting the selection of <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> as a trustee of <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, took over an auditorium stage Friday, forcing officials to move a convocation including presentation of an honorary degree to comedian <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON> was a scheduled speaker at a ceremony marking the founding of the predominantly black university 122 years ago. But students carrying signs demonstrated outside the auditorium, streamed inside, chanted and took over the stage. Others occupied an administration building for several hours, and some blocked reporters from entering. Police reported no arrests. The convocation was moved to an art gallery where there was a brief ceremony to give Cosby an honorary degree before he left the campus. `` The students at <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> have a tradition of being activists,'' university spokesman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hermesch </PERSON> said later. `` When they feel stongly about issues, they demonstrate.'' University President <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheek </PERSON> met with students who flocked to a convocation luncheon, and promised to meet with several representatives Saturday to discuss their grievances, <PERSON> Hermesch </PERSON> said. The students said their main complaint was the school's decision last month to name <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> to its board of trustees. Their comments indicated they identified <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> with controversial ads, during <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s presidential campaign last year, featuring <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>, a murderer who attacked a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> couple while he was on furlough from a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> prison. The <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> issue contributed `` to the rising anti-black sentiment of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, a spokesman for a group of students who organized the protest, `` and we feel that facilitated the election of former -LRB- <PERSON> Ku </PERSON> <PERSON> Klux </PERSON> -RRB- Klansman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> to the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> state Legislature'' recently. `` We've been down this road before,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>. `` The prison furlough issue has been explored ad nauseam,'' he said. `` That was not racially motivated whatsoever. It was simply an issue that was explored because of the peculiarity of the institution in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>,'' he added.

 A storm dumped up to a foot of blowing, drifting snow on the upper <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> on Friday, closing scores of schools and snarling highways, and freezing rain stymied airport traffic and downed power lines and a radio station tower. Winter storm warnings were posted over much of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, northwestern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, southwestern <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, south-central <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, much of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, most of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, and parts of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. In the <ORGANIZATION> Rockies </ORGANIZATION>, 16 inches of snow fell overnight at <LOCATION> Steamboat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo </LOCATION>. In the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, record cold hit a day after a record snowstorm blamed for four deaths that dumped up to 14 inches of snow in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s Puget Sound area. <LOCATION> Seattle-Tacoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, hit a record low of 24 degrees, <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, hit 29 and <LOCATION> Astoria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, had a record 24, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. Drifting snow closed a section of Interstate 15 in central <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> for about an hour during the morning rush and the <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> was so busy with reports of fender-benders it could not provide an estimate on the number of accidents. A foot of snow fell by midday at <LOCATION> Worthington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, with 1 to 3 inches over most of the rest of the southern part of the state, the weather service said. Two traffic deaths were blamed on the snow. `` Traffic is very slow and it's slippery in spots,'' <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> State Patrol Trooper <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said of conditions in Minneapolis-St. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> authorities reported 10 inches of snow in the <LOCATION> Eagle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Butte </LOCATION> area in the northwestern part of the state, with 6 to 8 inches elsewhere. The snow started falling Thursday and <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, in the state's southeast corner, had 6 -LCB- inches by Thursday night. `` People are wanting this snow, farmers especially, so we're giving them what they want,'' meteorologist <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Jansen </PERSON> said After several years of drought, the mountain snowpack in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> was near normal for the first time in seven years after the storm dumped more than a foot of snow in places, officials say. The weather service said <PERSON> Helena </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> already have exceeded their average annual snowfall, with <PERSON> Helena </PERSON> recording 60 inches and Great Falls 70.3 inches. `` Things are looking pretty good this year,'' said <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Farnes </PERSON>, snow survey supervisor for the <ORGANIZATION> Soil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` Statewide we area between 80 to 95 percent of our average.'' Northern Iowa got 2 to 6 inches, with northerly wind causing drifting. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, School Superintendent <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON> said he canceled classes for fear that buses might get stuck. `` We had light snow at 5 o'clock but it has turned to what I'd call heavy with 20 -, 30-mile per hour winds,'' he said Radio station <ORGANIZATION> WCCO </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, which regularly broadcasts school closing announcements, reported it counted more than 180 schools idled by the storm in southwestern and southern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. Up to 5 inches of snow accumulated in western <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and freezing rain glazed roads in the east, closing dozens of schools. <ORGANIZATION> Omaha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> buses started limited service more than three hours late because of icy roads, the city's <LOCATION> Eppley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airfield </LOCATION> was closed and garbage pickup was suspended. Freezing drizzle knocked out power lines in several areas of <LOCATION> northwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, and more than 300 utility poles were down in <LOCATION> Sherman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. There was no estimate on the number of affected customers. At <LOCATION> Oberlin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, KFNF-FM's 420-foot broadcast tower collapsed under the weight of ice from two days of freezing rain. `` At 8:30 I heard what sounded like pieces of ice breaking off and hitting the roof. It kept getting louder and louder and ended up sounding like a freight train,'' said <ORGANIZATION> KFNF </ORGANIZATION> operations manager <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bainter </PERSON>, who was alone in the studio at the time. <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Deremer </PERSON>, general manager and part owner of <ORGANIZATION> KFNF </ORGANIZATION>, said it would be at least a week before the station would be back on the air. Freezing rain also extended into <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> and Midway airports remained open, but flight delays averaged about an hour, the city's aviation department said.

<HEAD>Rebels Blamed for Butchering 39 Peasants in Peru</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AYACUCHO, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Shining Path guerrillas executed 37 men in a peasant village by cutting their throats, and shot to death a mother and her baby when the woman tried to flee, a military official said Friday. The attack Monday in a remote village was one of the bloodiest since the <ORGANIZATION> Shining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION> launched its insurgency in <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION> state in May 1980. In a related matter, the government Friday prolonged for two months anti-rebel emergency measures in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> and parts of seven states where more than half of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s 21 million people live. The measures suspend constitutional guarantees to travel and meet freely. They also permit government forces to conduct searches without a warrant and detain suspects for up to two weeks without filing charges. About 200 rebels in seven boats seized <LOCATION> Canaire </LOCATION>, a mountain hamlet located on the <LOCATION> Apurimac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> 55 miles east of <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION>. The rebels surrounded villagers who had assembled in the central plaza, executed 37 men and shot to death a woman and her 9-month-old baby when she tried to flee, the official said. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the violence was a revenge attack by the Maoist Shining Path guerrilla group. At the military's urging, <PERSON> Canaire </PERSON> had formed a peasant patrol against <ORGANIZATION> Shining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION> attacks and members were gathering in the village plaza to make rounds when the guerrillas arrived, the official said. Many of the attackers wore army and police uniforms and took the peasants by surprise, he said. Villagers were confined in the village church after the executions, which they were forced to witness, he said. Since 1980 both rebels and the military have been accused of slaughtering peasant farmers in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Andes </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>, mainly in impoverished <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION> state. In the largest massacre on record, guerrillas killed 87 peasants in 1983 in the village of <LOCATION> Lucanamarca </LOCATION>. In 1985, troops slaughtered 69 villagers in <LOCATION> Accomarca </LOCATION>. The Shining Path has systematically attacked villages that have organized peasant patrols under military orders to defend themselves against the rebels. Most peasant patrols are poorly armed with lances, slings and shotguns. The central and southern Andean highlands are populated by Quechua-speaking Indians who live in isolated hamlets. <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION> state, is located 235 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. The region is the cradle of the <ORGANIZATION> Shining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION> fight, which has claimed more than 12,000 lives. A state of emergency was first declared in <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION> in late 1982, and the measure has been prolonged periodically since. Other regions in the central highlands, the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> coast and the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> jungle were later declared emergency zones as insurgency spread.

 Radio stations nationwide are boycotting <PERSON> Cat </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> songs because the 1970s balladeer said he supported <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s murder threat against `` Satanic Verses'' author <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>. The former pop star, however, denied Friday that he wants to see the writer killed. He said he was `` totally abhorred'' by press publicity and headlines such as, `` Kill <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> says <PERSON> Cat </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, a Briton who took the name <ORGANIZATION> Yusuf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION> and founded an Islamic school in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> when he became a Moslem in 1977, said he had `` simply stated the Islamic ruling on the <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> affair'' when he was asked a question at <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Polytechnic </LOCATION>, a college near <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, on Feb. 21. He said in a statement issued in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> that his only fault was `` being honest.'' He also said the novel `` insults God and His prophets, including those prophets honored by Christians and Jews as well as Moslems.'' Stations such as KZPS-FM in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, WCXR-FM in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, WEBE-FM in <LOCATION> Westport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, WBZY-AM in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> KLSX-FM </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> have dropped Cat Stevens records from their programming. In <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, WRIF-FM promoted a `` No Cat Stevens Weekend'' by cutting into his songs with explosions or the sound of someone punching someone `` right after a very optimistic and non-violent line of dialogue,'' program director <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> said Friday. `` We're doing the ` No Cat Stevens Weekend' to make a point about one human being advocating the death of another. ... This guy carries a lot of weight, a lot of people grew up listening to his stuff,'' <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> said. The tempest stems from <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' remarks to Moslem students in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> last week in which he endorsed <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s call to kill <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> for writing the novel that many Moslems consider blasphemous. `` The Koran makes it clear: If someone defames the prophet, then he must die,'' the singer-turned-teacher told the students. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> was a leading singer-songwriter of the 1970s, with such hits as `` Moon Shadow,'' `` Peace Train'' and `` Wild World'' in 1971, `` Morning Has Broken'' in 1972 and `` Another Saturday Night'' in 1974. But he abandoned his career and stage name years ago. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said Friday that it is the duty of every Moslem to put forward the Islamic viewpoint `` and that is what I did.'' `` My only crime was, I suppose, in being honest. I stood up and expressed my belief and I am in no way apologizing for it,'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said in a statement. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' statement was headed in black type: `` Under Islamic Law, the ruling regarding blasphemy is quite clear; the person found guilty of it must be put to death. Only under certain circumstances can repentance be accepted.'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said Moslems in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> must observe British laws, but might have to become more involved in British politics if the government would not comply with their demands for a ban on <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s novel. <PERSON> Bender </PERSON>, who estimates WRIF only played Cat Stevens songs once or twice a week, readily admits ` we're just goofing around'' and he believes much of the fuss on the nation's airwaves has its roots in promotion. `` It's more ploy than politics,'' he said. In <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, disc jockeys at WGFX-FM dropped the singer's works and offered to swap their recordings for copies of `` Satanic Verses.'' Radio personality <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Leykis </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> KFI-AM </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> asked people to bring in records to burn, only to have that denounced by colleague <PERSON> Geoff </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, who was suspended Feb. 28 for refusing to run <PERSON> Leykis </PERSON>' promotions. <ORGANIZATION> KFI </ORGANIZATION> publicist <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Venema </PERSON> said a station announcement on the resolution of that conflict was pending. However, a bonfire scheduled for March 8 was canceled because the <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> revoked a permit it had granted, <PERSON> Venema </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Leykis </PERSON> said in a press release he would still destroy the records, perhaps by steamroller, but as an alternative he was trying to organize a celebrity concert protesting the death threat against <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>. A spokesman for WCXR in the nation's capital emphasized that the station pulled the records off the air Feb. 28 after serious discussion of listeners' complaints that they felt uncomfortable hearing <PERSON> Cat </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>. `` We did n't do this to generate publicity or to scream our call letters out,'' said promotion director <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Lapidus </PERSON>, calling the indefinite suspension of <PERSON> Cat </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> airplay a response to listeners' requests.

<TEXT>
 The White House, trying to save a <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> snake-venom researcher who was bitten by a rare snake, searched remote corners of the globe for serum and then used <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government contacts Friday to speed the medicine to his bedside. Two badly needed serums were located in out-of-the way parts of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and with the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> getting the Customs Service to waive normal clearance rules, were en route to <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> late Friday. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Haast </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Serpentarium </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION>, maintains 1,000 exotic, poisonous snakes at the lab, which provides venom to health organizations and others for research and use in manufacturing anti-venins. The 78-year-old man had been bitten nearly 150 times previously, and he thought he had built up immunity. <PERSON> Haast </PERSON> evidently did not initially consider Thursday's bite by a Pakistani pit viper to be serious. But he became ill and was in serious condition Friday at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, awaiting the rare serums that could give him a full recovery. He already has been treated with massive doses of antivenin, including a shipment the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> hospital obtained through an unusual airport relay involving a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> zoo, a helicopter and a <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> jetliner. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Studdert </PERSON>, a special assistant to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, said he got a call Thursday night from an associate of <LOCATION> Haast </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Studdert </PERSON>, who is from <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, had given a speech there recently describing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s `` kinder, gentler'' approach to human problems. An associate of <PERSON> Haast </PERSON> read an account of his speech, <PERSON> Studdert </PERSON> said, and called for help Thursday night. <PERSON> Studdert </PERSON> said the White House switchboard relayed the call to his home, and the associate, whom he did not identify, `` asked how we could help. The serum could not be located in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, only in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' The presidential aide said he immediately set up conference calls with people around the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and in other countries. He said doctors and other specialists advised the White House that the serums <PERSON> Haast </PERSON> needed were not available in this country. What then transpired is an unusual joint-effort involving people in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, with planes rushing for clearance and being met on airport runways by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government emissaries seeking to protect the serum and get it delivered. Over the next several hours, <PERSON> Studdert </PERSON> said in an interview, he arranged through <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, medical and other private sources for `` people-to-people, non-government'' contacts in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and direct government contacts between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Using an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> interpreter who speaks <LOCATION> Farsi </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Studdert </PERSON> put <PERSON> Haast </PERSON>'s representatives in telephone contact with serum specialists in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, who located one of the necessary serums about two hours from <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Studdert </PERSON> explained that two different serums were needed _ one for young Pakistani pit vipers and another one for the older snakes of the same kind. Then, he said, he put <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON>, a White House transportation office official, to work organizing the flight routes for delivering the serums. Vials of the Iranian serum were flown by <PERSON> Luththansa </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, where the flight was met by representatives of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Consul General's office and then transferred on an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France </ORGANIZATION> flight to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. The vial was then to be flown to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, picked up by a <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> helicopter and flown to <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> and put on an <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> flight scheduled to arrive in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> Saturday afternoon. Subsequently, <PERSON> Studdert </PERSON> and his colleagues located the second serum _ the one for younger Pakistani pit vipers _ at the <ORGANIZATION> English </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, and that a <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> flight was headed from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> with that package. `` Doctors are going to go ahead and administer the serum from the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> young-snake unit,'' he said. In addition, another supply of the necessary serum was obtained with through the <ORGANIZATION> Tashkent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vaccines </ORGANIZATION>, working cooperatively with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> through the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Studdert </PERSON> said. That serum was put on an <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> flight from <LOCATION> Tashkent </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and was being flown to <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> for eventual shipment to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` When I decided I should get involved, I clearly did not want to disturb the president,'' <PERSON> Studdert </PERSON> said. `` But I decided, this is what the president would have wanted us to do.'' `` We're not in the business of transporting pharmaceuticals,'' he said. `` But this was a case where the medical solution was not available in this country and we were happy to be able to play a role.''

<HEAD>New Era in Reporting on Private Lives</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A panel of present and former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> correspondents and former presidential press secretaries debated the limits of reporting on private lives of public officials Friday, with the <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> confirmation battle as a backdrop. The discussion took place during a symposium on the press and the presidency, sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Baines </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> <PERSON> Library </PERSON>. <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Clift </PERSON>, who covered the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and now covers <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION>, said there was an `` audible gasp'' when Tower was asked at a <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> luncheon earlier this week whether he had ever violated his marriage vows. Tower, whose drinking habits and relations with women have dominated debate over his nomination to be secretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION>, conceded he had done so, but said he did n't think he was alone. `` I think we all squirm a little when we get into these areas,'' Ms. <PERSON> Clift </PERSON> said. `` I think we all like to think there is a line beyond which we personally do n't go. I am uncomfortable. In the old days there was a clear rule. If it did n't interfere with the professional duties, it was n't news. Well, the line between private lives and professional duties is now so murky that almost anything spills over. So we do n't know where to draw the line.'' Although the discussion tounched on the Tower controversy, the question posed for the panelists was in the context of reporting about the private lives of presidents and their families. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerstenzang </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said, `` If the president is performing in front of us, if it's something we are finding out, we are seeing or hearing about him, that's usable.'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Cormier </PERSON>, retired White House correspondent of The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, told the group that when he was covering President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> aboard Air Force One, `` everything was off the record unless specified otherwise.'' `` It's very difficult for us in retrospect to realize how limited in a sense things were 25 years ago,'' <PERSON> Cormier </PERSON> said. In the <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, he said, `` things got very fuzzy'' as to what was off the record. `` I guess they've gotten less fuzzy now,'' he said. `` I guess anything's fair game.'' <ORGANIZATION> Marianne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hearst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION> said reporters `` are tougher on ourselves today in all these personal areas, as we are tougher on our presidents.'' Ms. <PERSON> Means </PERSON> said that when she first came to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, `` people took free trips from people they were covering; the bottles of booze would arrive at Christmas.'' <PERSON> Sid </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> correspondent for NBC News, responded, `` It is true that journalists today do n't take tickets and booze and airplane rides, but I am not sure on the substance of stories that the standards are better today than they were 15 or 20 years ago.'' `` In the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> era, we did hear stories about <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s private and social life, and those of us who covered <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> those days are often asked why we never put those stories on the air,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. `` The reason why we never put them on the air is because all we heard was rumors.'' `` There are things that happened when we were correspondents that we did n't put on the air that would get on the air today or into print today,'' he added. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON>, former spokesman for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, said intense competition, spurred by the advent of 24-hour television, `` is driving the news to be stretched awfully thin at points. Reporters are having to come up with some new angle on a story where there may be no new angle.'' Ms. <PERSON> Means </PERSON> said that the more `` packaged'' a candidate or president become, the more `` sort of a cardboard person,'' the greater is the pressure on reporters to `` get behind that and see what the person is really like.'' `` That's where we get into areas that we used to consider strictly private,'' she said. <PERSON> Jody </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s press secretary, said he was `` recoiling at the thought that the packaging of the candidates would suddenly cause us to begin writing about adultery. It seems to me that is not exactly why we are doing it.'' <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, deputy press secretary to President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, said, `` The press, I think all of us, must live up to a little higher standard and I think when reports are floated around about elected officials, both in the executive branch and on the Hill, I think we should spend more time trying to prove or disprove those reports.'' <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bureau chief for <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` All those candidates put out a press release every time they sneeze. They know that their life is going to be an open book.''

 Five Carmelite nuns who have spent five months barricaded inside their cloister, protesting what they call the liberalization of their order, said they would defy their eviction Friday by the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. Two of the women who had taken temporary vows which expired during the protest were told they must vacate the Monastery of the Most Blessed <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carmel </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Paterson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diocese </ORGANIZATION> announced. The diocese added that the two were no longer considered members of the religious order. Two others were told they should seek residence in a different convent, and the fifth, a 71-year-old nun who suffers from heart problems, would be allowed to stay in the convent, said <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Manning </PERSON>, a spokesman for Paterson Bishop <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodimer </PERSON>. <PERSON> Manning </PERSON> said he did not know if the five nuns would be forcibly removed if they refused to leave. `` I think perhaps that maybe a bit more time needs to elapse before those kind of decisions are made,'' he said. The nuns challenged the validity of the ruling Friday and said they would continue their protest, said a spokeswoman for the group. `` Nothing came here with a <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> seal on it,'' said the spokeswoman, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON>. `` It's the Bishop's final trick to get them out.'' Five of the cloister's 13 nuns locked themselves in the infirmary of their aged white-walled priory on Oct. 4 to protest the introduction of such things as television and sweets into their retreat. The nuns, saying they wanted the monastery returned to the Carmelites' traditionally austere lifestyle, drew international attention. <PERSON> Rodimer </PERSON> called the protest `` attempted anarchy.'' The rebel nuns had said they had feared they would be evicted for protesting the changes, which were initiated by their mother superior, prioress <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Hewitt </PERSON>. `` Despite the difficult situation created by some of the religious, the fundamental principles of religious life were firmly retained with prudence and charity,'' read the ruling from the Congregation for the Religious, the arm of the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> that oversees religious communities. <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Hewitt </PERSON> called the lock-in a `` scandal'' when the nuns took over the infirmary and criticized the unruly members of her flock for disrupting the cloistered lifestyle at the <LOCATION> Carmel </LOCATION>. The former Sister <PERSON> John </PERSON> was one of two nuns whose vows expired during the protest, <PERSON> Manning </PERSON> said. She is now known as <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON> <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON> and the other nun, the former Sister <PERSON> Bernadette </PERSON>, is now known as <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, he said. The other nuns were identified as Sister <PERSON> Philomena </PERSON>, who suffers from heart problems, and Sister <PERSON> Teresita </PERSON> <PERSON> Romano </PERSON> and Sister <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Ercalano </PERSON>.

 Gunmen killed a Marxist political leader and one othe person during an attack Friday at <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>'s international airport, authorities said Eight were wounded, including a senator. Police said one attacker was killed by bodyguards and three were captured. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Antequera </PERSON>, an executive board member of the Marxist-oriented <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, was fatally shot. Officials said he was the apparent target. He had received death threats from right-wing paramilitary organizations here. Also slain was <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, an official in the Attorney General's Office. Sen. <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Samper </PERSON> <PERSON> Pizano </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, a presidential hopeful, was wounded. Two little girls and passengers waiting to board planes also were injured. The attackers used 9mm automatic handguns. They struck at 3:40 p.m., when the political leaders arrived at the airport, escorted by bodyguards, to fly to <LOCATION> Cucuta </LOCATION>, near the Venezuelan border, and <LOCATION> Barranquilla </LOCATION>, on the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> coast. `` I had finished checking in my luggage to fly to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, when I heard explosions and I threw myself on the floor,'' witness <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Velez </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` I saw many people shooting indiscriminately.'' `` Everybody panicked,'' some another witness, who refused to give his name. `` Some people ran and other landed on the ground and other looked for shelter in the bathrooms and behind the airline counters. `` When the shooting finished, after 10 minutes, there were many people on the ground, wounded or dead.'' <PERSON> Antequera </PERSON> was dead on arrival at the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pedro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Claver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerra </PERSON>, an emergency service spokeswoman. Colombian paramilitary groups in the past three years have killed more than 400 political leaders and activists belonging to Communist and Marxist parties or affiliated with them.

 <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Keeler </PERSON>, whose affair with a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister shook <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON>'s government 26 years ago, was back on the front pages Friday because of a movie about <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s most sensational postwar scandal. The 47-year-old former call girl appeared at the world premiere of the movie `` Scandal'' Thursday night, accompanied by her 17-year-old son, <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON>. Critics loved the movie, but politicians condemned it for raking up memories of the affair that forced a minister to resign, caused the recall of a Soviet naval attache, and led to the suicide of a prominent <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> osteopath. Anglican Bishop <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> of <PERSON> Stepney </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s tough <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> End </LOCATION>, objected to the film for reviving interest in the downfall of Ms. <PERSON> Keeler </PERSON>'s former lover <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Profumo </PERSON>, who was minister of state for war. <PERSON> Profumo </PERSON> has long worked with alcoholics and the poor in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> End </LOCATION>, and in 1975 Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> made him a Commander of the Order of British Empire in recognition of his social service work. Ms. <PERSON> Keeler </PERSON>, who has had two failed marriages and lives on welfare in a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> public housing project, said she was glad the truth of those wild days of 1963 had been put on film. The movie recounts her introduction to Dr. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, a successful osteopath with left-wing sympathies and friends in high places. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> let Ms. <PERSON> Keeler </PERSON> live in his apartment and introduced her to Capt. <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivanov </PERSON>, an assistant naval attache at the Soviet Embassy. He took her to <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Astor </PERSON>'s country house, <ORGANIZATION> Cliveden </ORGANIZATION>, where <PERSON> Profumo </PERSON> spotted Ms. <PERSON> Keeler </PERSON>, then 18, swimming naked in the pool. After <PERSON> Profumo </PERSON>'s liaison with Ms. <PERSON> Keeler </PERSON> became public and it was revealed that she also had an affair with <PERSON> Ivanov </PERSON>, members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> expressed concern that government secrets might have leaked to the Soviets. <PERSON> Profumo </PERSON> denied in Parliament that he had slept with Ms. <PERSON> Keeler </PERSON>. In the face of growing evidence, however, he later admitted he lied to spare his wife, actress <PERSON> Valerie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hobson </PERSON>. He resigned June 5, 1963. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> was charged with living on immoral earnings and denied it. Just before his trial ended, when the case was going against him, he killed himself. Ms. <PERSON> Keeler </PERSON> swapped high living for <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Holloway </PERSON> jail in 1964 when she was given a nine-month sentence for perjury during the trial of another former lover, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> nightclub singer `` Lucky'' <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>. A major argument arose in Prime Minister <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON>'s Conservative government about how the matter was handled. <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Denning </PERSON>, then one of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s top judges, found no evidence that national security was endangered, but the Conservatives' image was badly damaged and they lost the 1964 election. Except for Ms. <PERSON> Keeler </PERSON>, real-life protagonists skipped the premiere of `` Scandal,'' but their screen counterparts showed up: <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Whalley-Kilmer </PERSON>, who plays Ms. <PERSON> Keeler </PERSON>; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON> as <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>; <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> McKellen </PERSON> as <PERSON> Profumo </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Britt </PERSON> <PERSON> Ekland </PERSON> as <PERSON> Mariella </PERSON> <PERSON> Novotny </PERSON>, a brothel keeper. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hattersley </PERSON>, deputy leader of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said of the movie about <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s most sensational postwar scandal: `` To rake it up ... seems to be a disgrace to our society.'' Conservative legislator <PERSON> Irvine </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> said: `` <PERSON> Profumo </PERSON> has paid the price and I think that to be dragged through it all again in what is a created reconstruction is totally and utterly unfair.'' <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s largest circulation tabloid, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION>, saw it differently: `` Anyone who remembers the Sixties will enjoy this film's nostalgia, anyone who does n't will still find it fascinating.'' <PERSON> Shaun </PERSON> <PERSON> Usher </PERSON> wrote in the Daily Mail: `` This account of the Profumo Affair is the most accomplished British commercial film in a long time _ fluent, engrossing, racing along the story capsuled long ago in that headline ` The Minister, The Model and The Russian Spy.''' <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> covered scandal for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> in those days and was one of the last people to talk with <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> before the osteopath killed himself. `` The film does not tell the whole story, but does tell it the way it was,'' he said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> said it cut its weekend schedule by nearly 75 percent Friday but had supervisors and other workers ready to keep the carrier operating `` indefinitely'' through a strike. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, executive vice president and chief operating officer, said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> was suspending service to nearly 60 cities on Saturday and Sunday. Service will be maintained to almost 50 cities, including <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s flights out of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and on its Northeast shuttle and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> routes, <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said. The schedule changes were made as a midnight strike loomed by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union. While nearly all of the more than 100 daily flights through <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> will be maintained, <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said, most flights will be suspended at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> hub. The company expects to gradually resume suspended flights if a strike continued in to next week, he said. `` We do not want to operate a schedule that is not 100 percent reliable.'' Eastern ticket offices were extending their hours to reschedule passengers from canceled flights `` to the extent that is humanly possible,'' he said. Eastern had strike contingency plans that would enable it to `` go on indefinitely,'' <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said. The airline had adequate cash reserves, <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said, which other sources have estimated at nearly $ 400 million. There were no plans for layoffs or asset sales `` right now,'' <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> told reporters Friday evening. He said the airline would use only Eastern pilots and that there were 200 experienced management pilots available. Although the 3,500-member pilots union planned to honor <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union picket lines, <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> predicted some union pilots would cross the picket lines. Eastern's extensive strike plans also included hiring 1,100 experienced mechanics and technicians to augment management maintenance workers, <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said. The company also has nonunion employees and supervisors ready to fill in for flight attendants, whose 5,900-member union said it would support the Machinists strike. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> had actually improved its on-time performance by 6 percent since sending the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> home Friday morning to prevent sabotage. The carrier has led all major airlines in on-time performance the past four months.

<HEAD>Federal Agents Mount Widespread Manhunt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal drug enforcers mounted their largest manhunt in years Friday, dropping all pending investigations and enlisting <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> aid to find an alleged drug dealer suspected of killing an undercover narcotics agent. `` We are going to get him,'' vowed <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stutman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. He assigned all 500 agents in his office to the hunt, with assistance from city police and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents nationwide. `` I am ceasing all other investigations in our office,'' the largest in the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Stutman </PERSON> said. `` Every agent will be working on nothing else until we apprehend this suspect.'' The search was for <PERSON> Constible </PERSON> <PERSON> Farace </PERSON>, 28, a paroled killer suspected of firing four gunshots into undercover DEA Agent <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> on Tuesday. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> had been trying to infiltrate a mob-run cocaine ring. `` We've had leads. We've had calls. We're doing everything we can,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Strang </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. `` Do we think we're close We think we are. We're going to continue to follow these leads until we find him.'' <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>, 46, was a 12-year veteran of the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and its first agent killed here since 1972. A <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran, he was unarmed when he was shot dead in his car in a remote area of <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. Outside a funeral home in <LOCATION> Booton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>'s widow, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>, blamed her husband's death on casual drug users who keep drug kingpins in business. `` A good man has been taken from us,'' she said, struggling to keep back tears. `` The loss that we feel is exceedingly deep, almost unbearable.'' `` Even through the grief and our loss, I must ask the question, who really killed <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>? Who are the ultimate guilty parties who create the market for the poison which he valiantly tried to remove from our society. `` We middle-class suburban Americans. We casual users, we dabblers in drugs, keep the market in drugs an ever-increasing one,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>. Agents assigned to trail <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> during his meeting with suspected drug dealers lost contact with him in heavy traffic shortly before finding him dead back at the meeting place. The Daily News reported that <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> bought about five ounces of cocaine from <PERSON> Farace </PERSON> in previous meetings and was negotiating a larger buy. The drug was thought to have been supplied by a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> distributor. Among other goals, investigators had been seeking to determine whether reputed mobster <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Chilli </PERSON>, allegedly a powerful figure in the <PERSON> Bonanno </PERSON> crime family, was involved in the drug ring. <PERSON> Farace </PERSON> was paroled in June after serving eight years for a kidnap-murder. His uncle and cousin are reputed to be members of the <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> organized crime family, the News, <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newsday </ORGANIZATION> reported.

 A small plane crashed into a front yard in a suburban neighborhood Friday, killing at least one person aboard the plane and setting a house on fire, officials said. `` It looks like it hit in front of the house and cartwheeled,'' said <LOCATION> Roanoke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Fire Chief <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuqua </PERSON> said. `` We've got parts throwed from one end of the block to the other end.'' Three people in the house escaped, said <PERSON> Fuqua </PERSON>, but no one aboard the plane was thought to have survived. State police Sgt. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Childress </PERSON> said investigators believe there was only one fatality from the plane, but said they were not certain because the wreckage was so scattered. `` We've got bits and pieces of airplane and body parts. We're trying to put everything back together,'' <PERSON> Childress </PERSON> said The single-engine <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> crashed in rainy and foggy weather, and the cause was under investigation. <PERSON> Dallas </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> said he, his wife, <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> and 20-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Trina </PERSON>, were in the house when the plane hit their yard. `` We just heard this loud explosion,'' <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> said. `` We were in the den and watching TV. I jumped up and hit 911.'' <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> said he went outside through a side door. `` The trees were on fire and it spilled gasoline all over the yard. It was foggy. That may have had something to do with it.'' <PERSON> Childress </PERSON> said a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> investigation team would arrive Saturday. <PERSON> Childress </PERSON> said the plane reportedly was registered in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and had taken off from an airport in northern <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> en route to <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polytechnic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Blacksburg </LOCATION>, about 25 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Roanoke </LOCATION>.

 A fleet of tugboats and salvage ships worked in rough seas and gusty wind Friday to refloat a grounded tanker and stop any more of its cargo of 3.7 million gallons of crude oil from reaching <LOCATION> Oahu </LOCATION>'s beaches. Some of the 117,000 gallons of fuel and crude that spilled from the 800-foot tanker continued to leak and washed ashore along a one - to two-mile stretch of shore at Barbers Point on <LOCATION> Oahu </LOCATION>'s southwest coast, according to <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> Capt. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Piche </PERSON>, commanding officer of the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, said tugboat crews planned to try to free the ship at high tide at 2 a.m. Saturday. Crews were unloading ballast water Friday afternoon and preparing to remove some of the crude oil onto a barge, he said. Oil washed up on a beach where a popular tourist luau is held, prompting the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> to post `` Polluted Waters'' signs, and at other areas as far as two miles to the north, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON>. Helicopter crews determined the oil slick was not edging toward <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>. `` It's staying close to Barbers Point, and not drifting that much,'' <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> said. Tugboat crews reported Friday morning that no more oil was escaping from the <LOCATION> Exxon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Alcantara </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> attorney for <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> The ship's 23 crewmembers were not injured and remained aboard, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s Pacific Area Strike Team was on its way from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> with equipment to clean up the spill, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said. A local oil spill cleanup cooperative, called the <ORGANIZATION> Clean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islands </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, was activated and on the scene, said <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>, the Houston-based domestic oil and gas division of <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` In addition, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> has initiated response steps, including authorization of more tugs, if needed, to free the vessel,'' he said Elsewhere, an oil slick was spotted Friday off sensitive marine reserves in the northern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION>, but <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officials said the spill did not appear to be a threat to the area. Parks in the area reported small gobs of tar washing up, and said there did not appear to be major damage. Coast Guard spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Dye </PERSON> said dead birds were found out near the oil, but it was not clear if they were killed by the slick. `` We have no idea where it came from,'' he said. `` There are apparently no ships in the area.'' In <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>, the second oil spill in a month has been brought under control by Chilean navy personnel using chemical solvents to fight a kilometer-long slick created by a grounded Peruvian scientific ship, a Chilean navy spokesman said Friday. Leaks in two damaged tanks on the Humboldt were sealed by divers, he said. On Jan. 28, an Argentine navy ship, the <LOCATION> Bahia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paraiso </LOCATION>, ran aground off an <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION> some 300 miles from the site of the Humboldt's accident, creating a major oil slick. It was eventually cleaned up by ships and personnel from <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> spill occurred Thursday evening about 15 miles from <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, but an <ORGANIZATION> Oahu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said it was unlikely the oil would reach famed <LOCATION> Waikiki </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> to the east. `` The chances of that happening are very, very slim,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Apel </PERSON>. `` It's just too far away.'' There was no trace of oil along the shoreline beyond <LOCATION> Barbers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said, and there was no immediate move to close any beaches. There also was no evidence of affected marine life or seabirds being washed ashore, he said. Currents normally would carry the oil to the northwest away from <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, but gusty wind was blowing it in the opposite direction, he said. Nine tugboats worked to refloat the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION>, which broke free of its moorings and apparently drifted onto a reef during rough seas Thursday evening, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said. The ship's hull suffered minor damage, but was sitting in 16 feet of water and was in no danger of sinking, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said. `` We do know that one of the ship's fuel tanks and at least one of the empty cargo tanks have been breached,'' said <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>. The vessel was three-tenths of mile off Barbers Point on <LOCATION> Oahu </LOCATION>'s southwest coast and had just unloaded 16.8 million gallons of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Slope </LOCATION> crude oil to the Hawaiian Independent Refinery when it broke free of its moorings, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said The crew initially declined <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> assistance, but the ship's captain, <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Dick </PERSON>, later reported that the vessel was `` hard aground'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said. An estimated 25,000 gallons of crude oil spilled when the tanker broke free during unloading, and 92,000 gallons of heavy bunker fuel oil spilled when an aft tank was ruptured when the tanker went aground, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said.

 A Chilean couple who were denied political asylum in <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> tried to give away their five children Thursday by advertising for a foster home in a Norwegian newspaper. `` Is n't there a nice Norwegian family that wants to be parents to <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON>, 10, <PERSON> Luis </PERSON>, 6, <PERSON> Nicolas </PERSON>, 4, <PERSON> Natalia </PERSON>, 2, and <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON>, three months?'' asked the couple in the Faedrelandsvennen newspaper in the southern town of <LOCATION> Kristiansand </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Patricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Arrancibia </PERSON> <PERSON> Collao </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Raquel </PERSON> <PERSON> Quesada </PERSON> <PERSON> Molina </PERSON> took the painful step because they feared their children would be killed or disappear if they returned to <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, the national news agency <ORGANIZATION> NTB </ORGANIZATION> reported. `` This is the first time we've seen anything like this,'' said <PERSON> Tove </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnsen </PERSON>, manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Kristiansand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigrants </ORGANIZATION>' Office. `` I consider it very serious that a family has reacted so strongly to a rejection that they would give their children up for adoption rather than take them out of the country,'' she told the news service.

 Six leaders of a violent, multimillion-dollar crack ring were charged Thursday with nine murders and seven attempted murders, officials said. The defendants, all from <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, were in `` the business of death,'' said District Attorney <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Holtzman </PERSON>. `` These gang members allegedly killed not only members of rival drug gangs but tried to enforce their writ by killing their own employees to enforce discipline.'' The leaders also were accused of murdering three innocent bystanders in the course of operating the multimillion-dollar crack ring, <PERSON> Holtzman </PERSON> said. `` I think we got one of the major gangs,'' said <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief of Detectives, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Colangelo </PERSON>. `` There are several others but none have its scope and violence.'' A 70-count indictment charged the six men with enterprise corruption under the state's version of the federal racketeering statute. They also face numerous counts of murder, attempted murder, assault, weapons and drug charges. The crimes outlined in the indictment occurred between June 1987 and last month. If convicted, the defendants would face up to life in prison. The drug ring had about 50 members and six retail locations in east <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that each brought in $ 10,000 to $ 25,000 daily, officials said. `` The group was particularly callous in terms of sellin to youths,'' said <PERSON> Colangelo </PERSON>, who noted that two of the locations were near public schools. The gang's alleged leader was identified as <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Edmonson </PERSON>, 28, who was on parole for a robbery conviction. The other defendants are <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Amante </PERSON>, 31; <PERSON> Kyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, 24; <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Breland </PERSON>, 32; <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Easterling </PERSON>, 19; and <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, 28. <PERSON> Edmonson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Amante </PERSON> were arrested Wednesday and the other four were arrested earlier, officials said. In addition to the arrests, authorities seized $ 106,000 in cash, various guns, more than 400 vials of crack, the highly addictive cocaine derivative, and three ounces of cocaine, <PERSON> Holtzman </PERSON> said.

 A judge ruled Thursday there is sufficient evidence to try U.S.-born <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> for drug trafficking and violating <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rican </LOCATION> security by providing arms to Nicaraguan rebels. Judge <PERSON> Maximo </PERSON> <PERSON> Esquivel </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> tribunal in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carlos </LOCATION> would not say what evidence he used to make his decision. The judge said evidence indicates that between 1982 and 1986, <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> worked with a Costa Rican citizen to provide arms to Nicaraguan rebels, known as the Contras, in their guerrilla war against the lefist Nicaraguan government. A trial date has not been set. <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> will be tried in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carlos </LOCATION>, about 105 miles northwest of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, because the crimes allegedly were committed in that jurisdiction. <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>, 69, a former <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> resident, has lived in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> for 20 years. He has said he became a Costa Rican citizen eight years ago. <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> has acknowledged supporting the Contras and has said that in the past he let them use his property in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chiles </LOCATION>, 81 miles northwest of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> was been in custody since Jan. 13, when he was arrested by Costa Rican authorities. Since Feb. 14 he has been jailed in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carlos </LOCATION> after spending time in a hospital for heart problems. Sources in the Office of Judicial Investigations have said they acted after residents near <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>'s farm on the Nicaraguan border denounced activities by him that were seen as possibly endangering relations between <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON>, said Thursday said she would appeal the judge's ruling. She and other defense attorneys have tried unsuccessfully to have <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> released on bail. The 4th District Court in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> provisionally set bail at $ 12,500, but the superior court tribunal in <LOCATION> Alejuela </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION>, where the trial was later moved, denied bail because of the severity of the charges. <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> has argued that <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>'s arrest was politically motivated. <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> in the past has strongly denied any connection to drug trafficking. Witnesses testifying before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on illegal arms shipments to the Contras said <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>'s ranch was a way station for gun smugglers and cocaine traffickers. <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> was among 29 people named in a civil suit filed last year by two journalists. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Avirgan </PERSON> filed the suit with his wife, <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Honey </PERSON>, after being wounded in a 1984 news conference bombing blamed on the defendants. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> district juddge in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> ruled in favor of the defendants, saying the plaintiffs failed to prove their contention that a conspiracy was behind the bombing. Eight people were killed in the bombing and the apparent target, then-Contra leader <PERSON> Eden </PERSON> <PERSON> Pastora </PERSON>, was wounded.

 A communist rebel leader on Thursday rejected President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s demand that the guerrillas lay down their arms in exchange for peace talks, and guerrillas killed an outspoken anti-communist mayor. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jalandoni </PERSON>, foreign liaison officer of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> based in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, said in an interview with a <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> radio station that the rebels were willing to find a peaceful solution to the 20-year conflict. `` The -LRB- Front -RRB- is very willing to find a solution, a negotiated political settlement for a just and lasting peace,'' said <PERSON> Jalandoni </PERSON>, a former priest. `` But the condition that we should surrender is a pre-condition that is impossible.'' Last week, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said she was willing to renew peace talks if the 24,000-strong <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> lays down its arms. The Front is an umbrella organization of 12 Marxist groups, including the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philippines </ORGANIZATION> and its armed wing, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jalandoni </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s stand showed the president `` closed her mind to the reality that the <ORGANIZATION> NDF </ORGANIZATION> is a political force that has been struggling for years, that it has influence over 10,000 villages and that it can not surrender areas and people who sacrificed because of their principles and programs.'' The military claims <PERSON> Jalandoni </PERSON>, who has both <LOCATION> Dutch </LOCATION> and Filipino citizenship, is a member of the central committee of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jalandoni </PERSON> is believed to be in charge of rebel fund-raising activities in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> opened peace talks with the Front in 1986 but negotiations collapsed in January 1987 after she refused rebel power-sharing demands. Last week, Front spokesman <PERSON> Satur </PERSON> <PERSON> Ocampo </PERSON> said the rebels would consider resuming peace talks if the Aquino government agreed to close the six <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> military bases here when their lease expires in 1991. Also Thursday, police said <PERSON> Capistrano </PERSON> <PERSON> Legaspi </PERSON>, mayor of the town of <LOCATION> Kinogitan </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Misamis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oriental </LOCATION> province, was slain Wednesday by three suspected rebel assassins. The report said <LOCATION> Legaspi </LOCATION> was waiting for a ride home when the rebels approached and opened fire in the town about 470 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Legaspi </PERSON> was an outspoken opponent of the rebel movement.

 Mortality rates in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for two of the three leading causes of death _ heart disease and stroke _ are headed down, the national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. However, the second-leading cause of death, cancer, is going up. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> death rate from heart disease in 1987 was 313 per 100,000 people, down from 318 the year before. For stroke _ or cerebrovascular disease _ the rate was 61 per 100,000, down from 62. There were 196 cancer deaths in 1987 for every 100,000 Americans, up from 195 the year before. Heart disease, cancer and stroke account for about two-thirds of the 2 million deaths that occur in this country every year, the Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said in its weekly report. In actual numbers, heart disease killed 762,820 of the 2.2 million Americans who died in 1987. Cancer killed 477,190, and stroke killed 149,220. A year earlier, 2.1 million Americans died, including 765,490 from heart disease, 469,376 from cancer and 149,643 from stroke, according to Dr. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>, a researcher with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>. `` What we are seeing ... is the continuation of some long-term trends,'' <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> said. The decline in deaths from heart disease and stroke has been going on for a decade, said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Thom </PERSON>, an epidemiologist with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION>, Lung and <ORGANIZATION> Blood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. Most experts believe the decline can be attributed to improvements in personal health, greater prevention of disease, improvement in medical care for heart or stroke patients, or all of those factors, <PERSON> Thom </PERSON> said. `` The decline is ... very real, and very consistent,'' he said. `` There's got to be something doing it.'' Specifically, he cited trends toward quitting smoking, controlling high blood pressure and lowering cholesterol levels, as well as `` increased physical activity and, generally, health consciousness.'' At the same time, cardiac intensive care units have come into widespread use in hospitals, and heart surgery has become commonplace. `` There are plenty of reasons to think all those reasons contributed,'' he said. <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> said the cancer rate, which has been rising as those Americans age whose lifestyles included more smoking and more unhealthy foods, should fall in the coming years because of changing lifestyles among the young. `` We see the beginnings of the overall decrease in cancer mortality in a decrease among all age groups of people younger than 55, particularly young males,'' he said. Among 45 - to 54-year-olds, <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> said the cancer rate dropped from 181 per 100,000 in 1979 to 166 per 100,000 in 1986 He said preventive measures of the past two decades, such as improved diet and less smoking, contributed to that drop. Complete mortality figures from 1988 are not yet available, <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> said. The mortality rate from heart disease was showing a slight increase from 1987 levels in the 12 months from October 1987 to September 1988, he said, but that might be traced, in part, to an influenza epidemic last winter which preyed upon those at increased risk of problems from flu _ such as patients with chronic heart disease.

 A <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> air force helicopter burst into flames over <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> on Thursday and crashed into a heavily populated area, killing the three crew members but causing no injuries on the ground, police said. The front of the helicopter hurtled into the empty recess area of the <PERSON> Blas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Otero </PERSON> secondary school, said a <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> police official who asked not to be identified. He said the tail landed 60 yards away in a private courtyard. `` The students were apparently inside the building, in class, at the time of the accident,'' he said. The police official said firefighters quickly extinguished the burning wreckage in the heavily populated southeast <LOCATION> Aluche </LOCATION> neighborhood and added the crash had no impact on a shopping center about 100 yards away. `` There was an explosion, then -LRB- the helicopter -RRB- started doing somersaults and the rotor broke loose and then the tail disintegrated,'' a witness to the accident told <ORGANIZATION> Spanish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's a good thing the helicopter pilot managed to avoid crashing into the tall buildings that surround the area,'' <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Barranco </PERSON> told reporters on the scene. `` Thanks to the cool courage of the pilot there were n't any more deaths,'' the mayor said. <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Cmdr. <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Torregrosa </PERSON> said the accident killed the helicoper's pilot, co-pilot and mechanic, whom he identified as Capt. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Vidal </PERSON> <PERSON> Montero </PERSON>, 33; Capt. <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrido </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Parra </PERSON>, 30; and 2nd Lt. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Montero </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> said the French-built <ORGANIZATION> Puma </ORGANIZATION> helicopter was on a routine training mission.

<HEAD>Japan, France To Cut Iranian Oil Imports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> plan to cut imports of Iranian oil, officials said Thursday, but neither depicted the move as being in reaction to a death threat against novelist <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> A French oil company official, however, said the French decision was linked to worsening relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> after <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s revolutionary and religious patriarch, attacked <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> over his book `` The Satanic Verses. Many Moslems find the book blasphemous. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s cutback will be up to 20 percent over the next three months. Officials in the trade and foreign ministryies said it was because of a seasonal decline in demand and not motivated by the <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> affair. `` It's true that there will be a decline in coming months but it has nothing to do with political issues,'' said <PERSON> Tsukasa </PERSON> <PERSON> Kawada </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s Energy Resources Division. In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, an <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said oil companies were urged to slacken imports about 10 days ago. While <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> issued no formal directive on cutting oil imports, a senior official from the <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s hydrocarbons service `` suggested'' to French oil companies that they trim imports following <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s death threats against <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, according to industry sources speaking on condition of anonymity. The suggestion was not overtly linked to the <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> matter. Officials suggested only that a high level of imports was `` inappropriate'' at this time. But one official at a major <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> oil company said, `` It was suggested to us it would be inappropriate for us to increase our imports of Iranian crude, or to maintain them at a high level, in the present diplomatic context.'' <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s call on Feb. 14 for Moslems to kill <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> provoked some economic backlash in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, notably <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. All member nations of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> recalled their ambassadors from <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> condemned the death edict but did not withdraw its ambassador. So far this year, Japanese purchases of Iranian crude averaged about 300,000 barrels a day, greater than in previous months because of the larger winter demand. Purchases are likely to drop to 240,000-250 ,000 barrels in the second quarter, oil company officials say Last year, Iranian oil accounted for 5.7 percent of total Japanese oil imports, a drop of 18.3 percent from 1987.

<HEAD>China May Have 260 Million Surplus Workers by End of Century</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will have up to 260 million surplus workers by the end of the century, threatening serious economic disruption if more jobs are n't found, an official daily said Thursday. The Economic Daily said more than 200 million of the surplus laborers reside in overpopulated rural areas. The report came as cities in this nation of 1 billion try to cope with a deluge of rural migrants looking for better-paying city jobs. The prosperous southern province of <LOCATION> Guangdong </LOCATION> has put out an emergency appeal to the state to help it handle 2.5 million mostly rural outsiders who have flocked to the province in recent weeks. The daily, citing a report by the <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s labor force is growing by an estimated 10 million a year, outstripping the number of new jobs. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> said earlier this week that the urban work force increased by 3.6 million last year to 135.7 million. The report did not estimate how many of the surplus workers would be unemployed. Although the government has called on businesses to operate more efficiently, most state-run plants continue to retain their excess workers rather than lay them off. Economists say 20 to 30 million of the urban work force is excess manpower which could be cut without affecting production. In the countryside, about 80 million peasants have left the farm to work at small rural enterprises that have shot up during the past decade of economic reforms. However, many of these enterprises are now in trouble or closing down because of inefficiency, lack of energy and basic materials, or a cutoff in credit as the government moves to slow down the overheated economy. The report said that while laborers exceed job opportunities in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s underdeveloped areas, there is still a demand for labor in developed sections of the country. It suggested an easing of the nation's strict residence regulations to allow for greater worker mobility. The country should also set up a special rural labor development organization to organize rural laborers for work on the international labor market, it said.

 The Common Market has agreed to cut its use of chlorofluorocarbons, the synthetic compounds that destroy the Earth's ozone layer, by 85 percent and seek a total ban on its production by the end of the century. Chlorofluorocarbons, invented in 1930, are used in aerosol sprays, refrigeration coolants, cleaning agents and several other products. The compounds are blamed for depletion of the ozone layer that protects the Earth from the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays and for an increase in skin cancer.

 A city program considered a national model for steering contracts to minority businesses was overturned as too `` intrusive'' by the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, a ruling officials say could halt contracting for months. The court based Thursday's 7-0 decision on a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling in January that overturned a similar program in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. It was the high court's first reversal of an affirmative action program after years of upholding them.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called Friday for banning the production and use of ozone-depleting chemicals by the end of the century if adequate substitutes can be found. His move to protect the world's ozone layer, which shields the earth from much of the sun's cancer-causing ultraviolet rays, came on the heels of a decision Thursday by 12 European countries to pursue a ban on the chemicals instead of only cutting back on production, as the world's industrial nations had earlier agreed to do. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> accounts for about one-third of the production of ozone-damaging chemicals, primarily chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, which are widely used as coolants in refrigerators and air conditioners and as a cleaning agent for electronic and computer equipment. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, had sought the stronger administration position on CFCs before he left Friday for <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, where representatives from more than 100 nations are meeting to discuss the ozone-depletion problem.

 Airports handling heavy <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> traffic are boosting police patrols, designating picket areas and mapping contingency plans for the expected strike this weekend of the airline's <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union. In <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, home region of the Miami-based carrier, all three regional airports began planning days ahead of the Machinists' strike deadline at 12:01 a.m. Saturday how to keep operations running smoothly In <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, a federal judge issued an order barring <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' 21,000-member Machinists' union from staging a sympathy strike in the event of a walkout. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Magnuson </PERSON> said his temporary restraining order `` is in the best interests of the public'' to avoid disrupting flights. The order, which had been sought by the Eagan-based airline, remains in effect until a March 13 hearing on whether to grant <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s request for a preliminary injunction against the union. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, chairman of the Machinists' local at <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, called <PERSON> Magnuson </PERSON>'s ruling `` another nail in the coffin of labor people.'' At <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, adjacent to <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s corporate headquarters, extensive preparations have been made `` to maintain the airport operating and protect the public's right of access to the airport,'' according to <ORGANIZATION> Dade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Amalia </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>. There will be heavy weekend staffing, strictly designated picketing areas, extra tow trucks to keep ramps and roads clear, and additional Metro-Dade police officers on duty throughout the sprawling facility, Ms. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> said. Additional staff will be assigned to airport terminals to help stranded or delayed passengers, she said. On Thursday, a caravan of about 2,000 Machinists slowly drove vehicles past the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> airport terminal, causing a massive traffic jam that angered airline passengers. Similar protests were held in several other cities, including <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>. At <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale-Hollywood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> north of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Broward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's Lt. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Greeney </PERSON>, Executive Office of the department's airport division, said he plans to double airport deputy patrols Friday night <PERSON> Greeney </PERSON> said he has been in touch with both the local Machinists' union and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> management to seek cooperation in keeping heads cool in the event of a strike `` We've informed both of them we're not going to tolerate any acts of violence from anyone,'' <PERSON> Greeney </PERSON> said. At <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, operations spokesman <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, like his counterparts at several other Eastern-linked airports around the country, spent Thursday meeting with police and city officials for strike preparations. Additional security arrangements also were established at airports in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. In both <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, officials expressed additional concern over possible rail strikes in solidarity with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s machinists In the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> area, commuter railroads are expecting to be hit by a secondary strike if the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> walk out as threatened. The <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rail </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION>, which has about 135,000 daily riders, and the <ORGANIZATION> Metro-North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commuter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION>, which carries 95,000 daily commuters, both are vulnerable, along with <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> and freight railroads. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the head of <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> said the national passenger railroad would continue limited operations for only a few days if picketed by workers supporting any strike against <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Claytor </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>, also said that if Eastern is struck and sympathetic workers do not picket the railroad, <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> would add trains between <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and possibly between <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said a strike in the area by rail workers would affect 5,000 commuters who travel daily by train into and out of the capital.

 Federal mediators said a new contract offer was being considered by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and its Machinists, and they expressed hope of averting a Friday midnight strike that could disrupt travel nationwide. The union said Thursday the company had made the new offer, but <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> declined to confirm that, citing a news blackout. Eastern pilots, meanwhile, rejected a separate company offer designed to keep them from staging a sympathy strike with the Machinists. Both the pilots and flight attendants said they would refuse to cross picket lines if a strike is called after the end of a federally imposed cooling-off period Friday night.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> showdown pits one of the airline industry's most feared bosses against a union leader who may be the industry's most stubborn. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, 48, is a <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, son of <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> immigrants, <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> graduate and aggressive builder of the nation's largest airline company He's had no success dealing with <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union District 100 President <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, 55, a West Virginia-born mechanic and magnetic, self-educated man who says he takes his strategies from Zen, the Bible, <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and the ancient Chinese author <PERSON> Sun-tzu </PERSON>'s `` The Art of War.'' With a <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union strike deadline set for midnight EST Friday, about the only point the two driven men agree on is that Eastern may not survive a strike. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> bought Eastern three years ago with a warning that `` there ai n't no <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION>,'' and his new management sent <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s usually tense labor relations plummeting to new lows with wage concession demands, toughened work rules and thousands of layoffs, firings and suspensions. His Eastern management has added to a union-busting reputation he gained when he ended a labor confrontation at <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> in 1983 by taking the carrier into bankruptcy reorganization and getting union contracts abrogated. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> has outraged Eastern unions by taking over <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s computerized reservations system, collecting tens of millions of dollars in `` management fees'' and loans from <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, and agreeing to sell <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s profitable and prestigious Northeast shuttle service to developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> That $ 365 million sale is not final. Management says it has tried to work with <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, but that the union leader wants to run the airline himself. A booklet titled `` Charlie Says ...'' put out recently by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> warns: `` If <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> is n't stopped, he will destroy Eastern.'' Former Eastern chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Borman </PERSON> says <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> has `` a certifiably insane dream'' of running the airline himself, and <PERSON> Borman </PERSON> recently compared <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> to cult leader <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who led a mass suicide of followers in <LOCATION> Guyana </LOCATION> in 1978. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, elected president of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s largest union in 1980 and overwhelmingly re-elected twice, got <PERSON> Borman </PERSON> to back down and give pay increases in 1983 on the last day of a <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> strike deadline. In 1986, with Eastern facing bankruptcy, <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> refused to join the pilots and flight attendants in making wage concessions unless they were tied to <PERSON> Borman </PERSON>'s ouster. Eastern's board of directors refused, and sold the company to <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, who built tiny, money-losing <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> into the Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> that took over <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Frontier </ORGANIZATION> and other small carriers. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, who initially indicated he would n't involve himself in <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s labor situation, ignored a post-sale telegram from <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> asking for a meeting. But last year, as negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> stalemated and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> unions fought management with myriad lawsuits and political lobbying, <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> had dinner with <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. The dinner only led to more disputes and <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> continued to hope for a buyout of Eastern. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> contends that Eastern has been badly mismanaged for years at the employees' expense, and that workers would increase productivity and service with more input into how the company is run. Corporate kingpins <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> and <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> have all been approached by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> unions about buying <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, but <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, which has posted record losses since taking over the airline, has said there are no buyers on the horizon. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, a mechanic since 1956 at an airline whose last strike was in 1966, has seen his union rolls reduced from 12,000 to 8,500 since the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> takeover. `` Our people have been frustrated, there have been attempts to provoke wildcat strikes,'' <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> said recently. `` They have been brutalized by management that does n't care about the company's future. While promising `` a wing-ding of a strike,'' <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> also worried that the company may not survive. `` We've fought them as long as we could and we've had some success,'' he said. `` Unfortunately, our system does n't seem to look out for the working man.'' <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, meanwhile, made a last-ditch personal appeal to <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> pilots this week. In a videotape showing a shirt-sleeved <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> in a homey easy chair, he urged: `` Eastern is either going to make it through this period, make the changes that are necessary and go on and succeed ... or I'm afraid <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> is going to go through this juncture and perhaps end up in the corporate graveyard.''

Representatives of the two biggest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> computerized reservation services, Apollo and <ORGANIZATION> Sabre </ORGANIZATION>, said the criticism came at a time when they were taking steps to correct the situation. `` I'm surprised that they would be saying this now with all the things that have happened in the recent past,'' said <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' Sabre system. Since December, <ORGANIZATION> Sabre </ORGANIZATION> has offered travel agents two ways of displaying flight information, one of which is more favorable to European airlines, Ms. <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said. Apollo plans to offer two display options starting later this month, according to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McIntyre </PERSON>, director of products marketing for <ORGANIZATION> Covia </ORGANIZATION>, the parent of Apollo. The European accusations echo accusations by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines that <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> discriminated against other carriers with their reservation systems. Since 1984 the <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> has required the systems not to give any preferential treatment. <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> said he would raise the issue in a meeting with <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> officials this month. To date, `` There has been a marked reluctance from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government to open its ears to what has been said by the Europeans,'' he added. Reservations made through <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> computerized reservation systems often involve `` unnecessarily lengthy journey times with long overlays at connecting points'' because the computers favor <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers, <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> said. He said they list <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers on the first screen while flights of European carriers are tucked away on remote screens that booking agents do not check unless travellers say at what hour they want to leave. The five <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> systems are known as Apollo, <ORGANIZATION> Sabre </ORGANIZATION>, Pars, Datas-II and System One. <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> said none gives priority to flights to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> where warranted. As an example, he cited a non-stop <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco-to-Paris </LOCATION> flight on <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> UTA </ORGANIZATION> airline that he said is up to 5 -LCB- hours faster than flights on major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers that make stopovers. Yet Sabre puts the <ORGANIZATION> UTA </ORGANIZATION> flight on screen 9 rather than on the first screen, he said. Flights of <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Lufthansa </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Alitalia </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> SAS </ORGANIZATION> get similar treatment though they get travelers from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> hours faster than <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers, he said. <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> said the 22 <ORGANIZATION> ECAC </ORGANIZATION> nations will issue next week rules of conduct for <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s two main computerized reservation systems, Amadeus and <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION>. These rules, he said, give non-European carriers first-screen priority if their flights are more convenient. He called on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government to do likewise.

 <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakolta </PERSON> won a skirmish and now she wants to start a battle against what she says are sexually oriented and violent programs that cut into the network television fare her children can watch. `` The American family is beng painted into a corner. It's an invasion of my privacy at this point,'' <PERSON> Rakolta </PERSON> said Thursday. A flurry of letters starting in January brought <PERSON> Rakolta </PERSON> apologies from advertisers on the top-rated, prime-time `` Married ... With Children'' program. Some pulled their ads on the <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> series. <PERSON> Rakolta </PERSON> said Thursday she objects to having to monitor prime-time television for shows she does n't want her younger children to watch. `` If people want that stuff, they can pay for it, or rent it, or go to the movies,'' she said. <PERSON> Rakolta </PERSON> said she intends to start a group, or join existing ones, to organize national boycotts of advertisers. `` One person can really make a difference if they push the right buttons. And the right buttons are not the producers in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, they're the people that pay the money for the show,'' she said. The activism is new, said <PERSON> Rakolta </PERSON>, 40, who lives in affluent <LOCATION> Bloomfield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. She has daughters ages 18, 10 and 9, and a son, 8. Her husband, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakolta </PERSON>, is president of a large construction company. `` I've never been involved in a cause. I've been involved in civic groups, but nothing cause-oriented,'' she said. But she said that when she and her children watched `` Married ... With Children'' one Sunday night in January, she ended up shooing the children out of the room. The situation comedy, which began in 1987 and is <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>'s most successful show, is about a blue-collar family headed by shoe-store clerk <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rakolta </PERSON> said the first show she saw featured a man's visit to a lingerie store `` In the store, one woman removed her bra for strangers, asking how she looked. It showed a man that worked there, an older man, walking around in a garter belt. They mentioned vibrators on the show,'' <PERSON> Rakolta </PERSON> said. `` I was thinking it was a family program because it was prime time, 8:30 p.m. I was horrified. I wanted to know what kind of sponsors would sponsor a show like this,'' she said. <PERSON> Rakolta </PERSON> said she watched other episodes to see who advertised. On one, she said, the father asked his children, with his wife standing nearby, what women and `` dog do do'' have in common, and told them, `` They get easier to pick up as they get older.'' Since <PERSON> Rakolta </PERSON> wrote them, <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Kimberly-Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Tambrands </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> have told their advertising agencies not to buy time on the program. The president of <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON>, said his company will screen future episodes more closely. `` I must tell you that I am corporately, professionally, and personally embarrassed that one of our commercials appeared in this particularly unsuitable program episode,'' <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> wrote <PERSON> Rakolta </PERSON>. Fox officials defended the show. The <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> family is `` a comedic counterpoint to other fictional television families who enjoy above average incomes, greater opportunities and have more refined tastes,'' wrote <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bay </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> vice president. Some episodes in the parody of life `` in a lower socioeconomic family'' may offend some viewers, wrote <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lieberthal </PERSON>, chairman of its producer, <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> _ whose parent company is owned by <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` Hopefully, many people -LRB- though we know not all -RRB- will be entertained by the outrageously absurd lives and off-center values of the Bundy family.'' <PERSON> Rakolta </PERSON> said she did n't see the humor. `` They're exploiting women. They're stereotyping poor people,'' she said.

<HEAD>Whittle Reports No Advertiser Defections From TV News Project</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The architect of a plan to send commercials along with a news show into classrooms says advertisers backing a test run of the program are standing firm despite growing criticism of the proposal. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Whittle </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Whittle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> LP </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, said eight sponsors have signed contracts to buy 80 percent of the commercial time available during the test that starts Monday. `` No one who has signed has even called and said they were worried,'' he said Thursday in response to reports that a second major education group has gone on record opposing commercials in school. Whittle refused to identify the eight sponsors, saying it would become evident who they are once the test run starts in six schools on March 6. As part of the test, <LOCATION> Whittle </LOCATION> has equipped six schools with about $ 50,000 each in television monitors, recording equipment and sattellite dishes so they can receive the 12-minute daily news show he is producing for teen-agers. The schools, in exchange, are to run the show each school day. The show, called Channel One, will include two minutes of paid commercials. The advertising has outraged some educators, who say big business should not be allowed that kind of access to the classroom. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parent-Teacher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that its 22-member executive committee opposed sending commercials into the schools. Earlier this week, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Secondary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Principals </ORGANIZATION> voted to urge principals to avoid programs that have commercials. <ORGANIZATION> Levi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strauss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the San Francisco-based apparel maker, is one of the sponsors of the test, but <PERSON> Levi </PERSON>'s marketing manager, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Chew </PERSON>, said the uproar has n't prompted the company to reconsider its support. `` We are very sensitive to the public debate and we are monitoring it and listening as closely as anyone else,'' he said. But he said that public reaction to the idea of including ads on a news show for schools is only one issue on `` a long list of criteria'' for making a decision on whether to continue advertising on the show if Whittle proceeds with plans to make it available next year in 8,000 schools. <PERSON> Whittle </PERSON> said many schools would not be able to afford a topical, daily news program like he is producing or the hardware. He says allowing two minutes of commercials is a reasonable way to finance it. He said his company has made presentations to 15 advertisers seeking their support for the program and that only three, whom he declined to identify, have declined. In addition to the eight that signed contracts, he said he is continuing negotations with four others and is hopeful that two of three of them will buy the remaining commercial inventory. <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON>, spokesman for sneaker maker <ORGANIZATION> Converse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reading </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, said Converse is n't interested in being a sponsor, though it counts on the teen-age consumers that Whittle is courting. `` Our feeling is that there are plenty of opportunities to reach the teen-age audience and we just feel that doing it in the classroom is maybe overdoing it a little bit,'' he said. In another development Thursday, <PERSON> Whittle </PERSON> said it had reached an agreement to send non-sponsored programming to the test schools from the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Network </LOCATION>, which represents public television stations in 13 western states. An unspecified number of programs will be delivered over the same satellite system that carries the Channel One program, and schools are free to use the shows as they choose. Whittle already publishes a number of magazines and sponsored posters that are distributed in schools across the country, and he notes that the advertising in those publications has not come under fire. But critics say a sponsored television show that is being shown in classrooms will be more difficult than other media for students to ignore.

<HEAD>GAF Stockholders Approve Management Buyout</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Chairman <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Heyman </PERSON>'s buyout offer for <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, once a casualty of the stock market crash, ended 18 months after it was launched when shareholders accepted the $ 1.46 billion bid. <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> told shareholders at a brief annual meeting Thursday that 94 percent of the shares for which votes were submitted approved the acquisition by a management group headed by <PERSON> Heyman </PERSON>. The deal will likely be made final in two weeks when financing arrangements are completed, <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> said. Stockholders will receive $ 46 in cash and an estimated $ 7 worth of subordinated debentures for each share. The transaction is backed by $ 885 million in bank loans led by <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and $ 285 million in high-yield `` junk'' bonds underwritten by <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Heyman </PERSON> and management group members are investing $ 100 million through the purchase of senior subordinated increasing rate notes. A maker of specialty chemicals and building materials, <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> in 1988 earned $ 90.8 million, or $ 3.18 a share, before extraordinary credits, on revenues of $ 961.4 million. As the announcement was made, the trial of <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> and Vice Chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON> continued in federal court in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> with the second day of the defense presentation. The government accuses <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION>, two subsidiaries and <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON> with illegally trying to manipulate <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> stock before <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> planned to sell <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> shares in 1986. `` We are extremely gratified by the outcome of the shareholder vote,'' <PERSON> Heyman </PERSON> said in a statement. `` It clearly demonstrates the success of a process which was designed from the outset to realize for shareholders the highest current value for their ownership interest in the company.'' <PERSON> Heyman </PERSON>'s first offer came in September 1987. It was valued at $ 2.3 billion, or $ 66.50 a share, and was withdrawn after the Oct. 19, 1987, crash, after which <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> shares traded at a low of $ 31.50. The following December, stockholders were offered $ 48.50 a share and the bid was sweetened last year to its current $ 53 a share. One analyst said the new ownership will have to do something to pay for the purchase. `` One thing is very clear: cash flow from the current operations can not pay down the debt,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. Rose of <ORGANIZATION> Oppenheirmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` It's hard for me to imagine any assets being sold,'' he said. `` Maybe there's a lot more of earnings potential to be realized.''

<HEAD>Racy TV Show Loses Several Major Advertisers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The defection of several advertisers from the television comedy `` Married ... With Children'' highlights concern among image-conscious corporations over TV's increasingly racy fare, some industry insiders said. Two major advertisers quit buying time on the <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> situation comedy. Others have spurned selected episodes for fear the show's frank language and references to sex would offend viewers, executives of the advertisers said Thursday. Advertising already is tough to find for `` tabloid TV'' programs such as `` Geraldo'' that delve into kinky sex, devil worship and similarly salacious subjects, advertising executives say. Some defectors from `` Married,'' which is the fledgling <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>'s top-rated show, were influenced by an energetic letter-writing campaign by a Detroit-area mother, <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakolta </PERSON>, spokesmen said The show, about a blue-collar family named <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>, features references to sex and bathroom humor, buxom women and frequent portrayals of the husband berating his wife. Two advertisers, <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, bought some ads on the show but have decided against further sponsorship, spokesmen said Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> officials said they had decided against running national advertising on the show, though individual, locally purchased ads for the two had run. <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>, whose president, <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON>, wrote an apology to Mrs. <PERSON> Rakolta </PERSON>, continues to screen `` Married'' episodes for content, but has n't found one suitable for advertising since her complaint Jan. 15, said spokesman <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Tortorici </PERSON>. Advertisers' concerns were summed up by <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON>: `` We felt that the whole theme of the show is basically one we do not want to be associated with. We were concerned about the negative portrayal of American family life.'' <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, which purposefully appeals to the young adult audiences advertisers covet in its efforts to build a fourth television network, has n't had any trouble selling ads on the show, which is broadcast Sunday evenings, said spokesman <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Turell </PERSON>. `` The show is completely sold out,'' he said, adding that news reports of Mrs. <PERSON> Rakolta </PERSON>'s campaign prompted calls of support from viewers. `` We have received literally hundreds of telephone calls today from across the country from viewers saying that this one woman's opinion is getting too much attention and hoping that we wo n't change the show,'' <PERSON> Turell </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION>, which makes hundreds of household products, bought ads on several `` Married'' episodes last year, stopped from October through December then sponsored two shows in January, Ms. <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON> said. After receiving Mrs. <PERSON> Rakolta </PERSON>'s letter, officials reviewed the show and decided against further ads, she said. American Home Products, which makes goods ranging from Jiffy Pop to Woolite, had already decided to disassociate itself from the show before receiving Mrs. <PERSON> Rakolta </PERSON>'s letter, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Emerling </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Tambrands </ORGANIZATION>, which produces feminine hygiene products such as Tampax, planned to advertise on two `` Married'' episodes but canceled the second after a review prompted by Mrs. <PERSON> Rakolta </PERSON>'s letters, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Konney </PERSON>, a spokesman in the company's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> headquarters Advertisers face a dilemma in deciding whether to sponsor racy shows, which often attract big audiences but may offend some vocal consumers. So-called tabloid TV shows like `` Geraldo'' have difficulty attracting advertisers because of what many see as their exploitation of the weaker side of humanity. A recent survey of advertisers and ad buyers found resistance to such shows, topped by the often-outrageous `` The <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> Jr.'' talk show, said <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, vice president of <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Righter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> firm that helps television stations sell air time. Virtually all big companies have guidelines for what kind of shows are acceptable for their ads, and most hire screening companies to check shows in advance for problems. As television presses the outer limits of taste _ boosted by more lenient federal regulations and greater competition for ads with other media _ finding an appropriate spot for an ad be difficult, said McDonald's spokeswoman <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Skurdy </PERSON>. `` Ours is a children's and family business,'' Ms. <PERSON> Skurdy </PERSON> said from the company's <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brook </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, headquarters. `` It has become increasingly difficult to find family programming on prime-time television.'' But <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Isaacson </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rubicam </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> advertising agency, said complaints about shows' content did n't appear any more frequent now than they ever have Those who seek to influence television content through pressure on advertisers are attempting censorship, said <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Sobel </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> attorney. `` If you do n't want to watch it then do n't watch it,'' Ms. <PERSON> Sobel </PERSON> said. `` I think what is inappropriate is to force your views on anyone else.''

<HEAD>Higher Rates To Restrain Spending But Retailers Unlikely To Suffer
Soon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

 Economists say rising interest rates have started to influence people's spending decisions, but purchases of clothing and other everday items will be among the last things affected. There was no evidence of a slowdown in consumer spending in reports Thursday from the nation's largest retailers, which showed many of them enjoyed healthy sales gains in February. A continuing turnaround in women's apparel and renewed demand for other consumer and household goods contributed to last month's gains for department stores, discount chains and general merchandise vendors. Retail sales measure important aspects of consumer spending activity, which accounts for about two-thirds of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic activity. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Kudlow </PERSON>, chief economist at the investment banking firm <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said the recent rise in interest rates, partly reflecting the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s effort to squeeze inflationary pressures, may be changing people's minds about spending. `` I think we are already in the early stages of a slowdown in consumer spending,'' <PERSON> Kudlow </PERSON> said. `` You are seeing a higher savings rate, which is the flip side of slower spending.'' Higher interest rates will have the most impact on purchases typically financed over time, such as cars and home appliances. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Feiner </PERSON>, a retail industry analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said the effect on sales of clothing and routine items will be much more limited. `` We still remain relatively sanguine about the retailing outlook, given the improvement in women's apparel as well as our belief that retailers will maintain very strong control over inventories and expenses,'' he said. For many of the retailers, February marked the start of their 1989 financial year. Balance sheets showed signs of improvement last year, analysts said, due largely to unexpectedly brisk business before and after Christmas. February typically is a low-volume month as merchants prepare for a seasonal shopping pickup in the spring. But analysts detected favorable omens in the latest tallies. One good sign was stronger sales of apparel, apparently because women are finding the latest styles more appealing than last year's fashions <ORGANIZATION> Limited </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the apparel retailer, said sales rose 22 percent in the four weeks ended Feb. 25 from the year before and sales at stores open at least a year _ called same-store sales _ went up by 19 percent. Retailers and industry analysts say same-store sales give a more accurate reading of a company's performance than totals that include sales at newly opened stores. Not every retailer reports same-store sales. At <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest retailer, sales of sporting goods, toys and auto accessories posted strong gains, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bozic </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merchandise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, which on Wednesday inaugurated a new low-pricing policy at all of its more than 800 stores, said sales for the four weeks ended Feb. 25 went up 13.2 percent from the year-earlier level and same-store sales rose 6.6 percent. K mart Chairman and Chief Executive <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonini </PERSON> said sales of small appliances, home electronics and items in its pharmacy division contributed to overall sales growth. K mart's sales for the four weeks ended Feb. 22 grew 8.3 percent and sales at stores open a year or more were up by 3.5 percent. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Howell </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> J.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said promotions for Valentine's Day and President's Day boosted sales, particularly for men's merchandise and home furnishings <PERSON> Penney </PERSON> said sales in the four weeks ended Feb. 25 increased 5.3 percent and same-store sales gained 2.5 percent. The company has discontinued lines such as home electronics, some sporting goods and photographic equipment over the year and, excluding those lines, sales for February rose 9.8 percent. Among other retailers reporting Thursday: <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the fast-growing discount and general merchandise chain based in <LOCATION> Bentonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, recorded a 25 percent sales rise in February. Same-store sales rose 11 percent. Minneapolis-based <ORGANIZATION> Dayton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hudson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said sales for the four weeks ended Feb. 25 were up 11 percent over the year and same-store sales rose 4.7 percent. The results reported Thursday were from most of the biggest general merchandise chains and apparel retailers, excluding <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> R.H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which do not release monthly figures. Unlike monthly retail sales figures released by the federal government, they do not include sales at auto dealers, supermarkets or restaurants.

 <ORGANIZATION> Minnetonka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, maker of <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> cosmetics, says it may offer itself for sale to maximize value for its shareholders. `` Comparable high-margin, luxury product businesses are commanding very high values in the private market,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Minnetonka </LOCATION>'s chairman, chief executive officer and largest individual shareholder. `` This underscores our belief that it is in the best interests of our shareholders to explore the sale of the company,'' he said in a statement Thursday. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Minnetonka </LOCATION>, which designs, manufactures and markets international lines of fragrance, personal care and leather accessory products, has retained <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> as its financial adviser to explore a possible sale and other alternatives to benefit shareholders <LOCATION> Minnetonka </LOCATION> on Wednesday reported a 1988 profit from continuing operations of $ 15.8 million, up 56 percent from the $ 10.1 million of 1987. Earnings per share from continuing operations were 94 cents, up 65 percent from 57 cents the previous year. Sales for the year rose 40 percent to $ 213.5 million, from $ 152.4 million in 1987. The company said its <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> cosmetics division accounted for $ 157.7 million of total sales, up 52 percent from 1987, and had a 66 percent increase in operating income to $ 27.7 million. `` The <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> cosmetics division has become the leading contributor to <LOCATION> Minnetonka </LOCATION>'s financial performance and has consistently delivered exceptional growth and profitability,'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Minnetonka </LOCATION>'s 1988 results included the launching of its <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> fragrance `` Eternity,'' which <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> predicted could match the success of <LOCATION> Minnetonka </LOCATION>'s `` Obsession'' fragrance. Both sell for around $ 185 an ounce. Sales figures for `` Obsession'' and `` Eternity'' are not available, said <PERSON> Elin </PERSON> <PERSON> Schomaker </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the company. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said the announcement that <LOCATION> Minnetonka </LOCATION> is considering the possibility of a sale does not guarantee `` that this exploration will result in proposals acceptable to the company or that any transaction will be consummated.'' `` We believe there is a significant gap between -LRB- <LOCATION> Minnetonka </LOCATION>'s -RRB- current share price level and the value that could be achieved in the private market,'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar held against most major currencies today, though some traders believed its recent rally was running out of steam. Gold prices rose. One trader in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> said the dollar's room for upward movement is limited by the continued worries about the health of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy. `` There are still too many fundamentals that are weak in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>,'' the trader said. Nonetheless, `` I'm not going to be selling dollars soon.'' Another trader in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> said that if the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rejects President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s choice of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> as secretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION>, the dollar would likely lose ground. `` The market generally likes a strong American president. But if Tower's candidacy fails, the ` wimp factor' will re-emerge,'' the trader said. The pound sank in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to $ 1.7205 from $ 1.7270 late Thursday. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar rose 0.05 Japanese yen to a closing 128.12 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 128.00 yen. Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.8443 West German marks, up from 1.8405; 1.5775 Swiss francs, up from 1.5710; 6.2740 French francs, up from 6.2575; 2.0831 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0735; 1,357.50 Italian lire, down from 1,360.50; 1.1935 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1945 Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 384.30 a troy ounce, up from $ 383.75 bid late Thursday. At midmorning, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $ 386.50. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, gold was trading at $ 386.50 at noon, compared with $ 383.25 late Thursday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold rose 86 cents an ounce to close at a bid $ 386.75. Gold dealers in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said the market appeared to be ignoring the dollar, while the metal gained strength from some short covering and buying interest out of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Dollar Steady Against Yen, Shares Off Earlier Highs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar held its ground against the Japanese yen at the end of trading today, while share prices toppled sharply from earlier highs to finish the week marginally lower. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar finished at 128.12 yen, up only 0.05 yen from Thursday's 128.07 close. It had started trading at 128.58 yen and moved mainly between 128.10-128 .70 yen during the day Dealers said the dollar was mainly supported by a West German decision Thursday not to change its interest rates. <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION>, the West German central bank, said it would maintain its discount rate and its Lombard interest rate at 4.0 percent and 6.0 percent, respectively. `` Because of the announcement, the dollar managed to touch 128.70 yen during the morning session, but fell back in afternoon trading,'' said a dealer with a major Japanese securities firm. He said a speech by Bank of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Satoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sumita </PERSON> in the afternoon erased gains made by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency, causing it to drop to 128.12 yen. In the speech to businessmen, <PERSON> Sumita </PERSON> said the domestic price situation is becoming `` more severe'' when compared to last year, and that it was important to act `` promptly and flexibly'' to deter inflationary fear. `` Market participants took that to mean <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> may hike its own interest rates,'' the dealer said, speaking on condition of anonymity. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s discount rate presently stands at 2.5 percent, the lowest among major industrialized countries. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> index also fell from earlier gains to close the week marginally lower at 32,000.10 points, down 73.63 points, or 0.22 percent. It had started trading with a strong 226.34-point gain, but lost steam because of profit-taking by cautious investors.

<HEAD>IRS Softening Health Plan Anti-Discrimination Rule</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> is temporarily softening the sting of a new law affecting the group health insurance of many American workers, but opponents say the only solution is repeal. A bill to kill the law, which requires businesses to demonstrate that their health plans do not discriminate in favor of upper-income employees, has been signed by 183 members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> LaFalce </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, says he expects a majority of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> _ 218 members _ to have signed his repeal bill within a few weeks. One employee-benefits consultant estimates that almost half the nation's companies with more than 1,000 workers can not say with certainty that their plans do not discriminate. The Internal Revenue Service on Thursday issued 220 pages of regulations explaining to employers how they could comply with the law, which is known as Section 89. The law was enacted as part of the big tax overhaul of 1986 and amended as recently as last November. Although the law took effect Jan. 1, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> said employers need take no action to comply with it before July 1. In addition, a good-faith effort to comply will be treated by the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> as having satisfied the law at least until next Jan. 1. Business representatives said the regulations do nothing to make th law more attractive `` Section 89 represents a major attack on our employee benefit system,'' said <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Berg </PERSON>, human-resources manager for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. `` In reality, it's a back-door effort to tax employee benefits. The length and complexity of the regulations make it clear that Section 89 should be repealed.'' `` It is obvious that they have failed to provide understandable guidance for Section 89,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sloan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> enacted Section 89 in an effort to extend health insurance to more workers. The provision requires employers to apply complex mathematical tests to their benefits packages to prove that they are not biased against workers making less than $ 50,000 a year. Many businesses complain that the law, by weighting them down with paperwork, could have the opposite effect by encouraging abandonment of employee health insurance. Treasury and <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> officials say their discussions with accountants indicate most businesses will have no major problem complying with the law. In large part, that assumption reflects that the general principles applying to health and welfare benefits are similar to those that have governed employee pensions since 1974. The regulations announced Thursday, on which the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> will take comments until May 8, apply chiefly to health insurance, since that is the benefit affecting most employers. However, the transition rules, including the date changes, also apply to term life insurance. Under the law, before an employer's benefit plan can be considered qualified by the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>, it must be written, enforceable, permanent and maintained exclusively for the benefit of workers. If a plan is not qualified, all employees pay tax on the benefit. A second set of requirements is designed to prevent the plan from being overly beneficial to higher-income workers. If an employer's plan fails this test, only the highly paid employees _ not rank-and-file workers _ would have to pay tax on the value of the excess insurance coverage In explaining the regulations, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> scoffed at a story repeated often by opponents of Section 89. This story holds that a hypothetical $ 20,000-a-year janitor whose $ 150,000 heart surgery is covered by insurance would have to pay tax on the full $ 150,000 if his employer's health plan failed to meet qualification rules. `` That result is not reached under these regulations,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> assistant chief counsel. The regulations state that if a plan does not qualify, a worker making under $ 50,001 would be liable for tax on only 10 percent of medical expenses that were reimbursed under the insurance plan. The percentage would rise with income; a worker earning over $ 150,000 would pay tax on the full reimbursement. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> said no penalty would be imposed for a small violation that was corrected within 90 days.

<HEAD>Slower Economic Growth Seen in 1989</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: Will be topped with 8:30 a.m. release of new report.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The economy is likely to continue its record peacetime expansion during 1989 but the pace of growth is expected to slow this year under the weight of rising interest rates, many analysts believe. While President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is pinning his budget and deficit-reductions plans on optimistic assumptions for a 3.2 percent rate of economic growth during 1989, many private forecasters expect the pace to be closer to 2.7 percent. The gross national product, the broadest measure of economic health, grew a robust 3.8 percent during 1988, but the pace fell to 2 percent in the final three months of the year. Most economists said 1989 opened on a strong note but that growth should slow as the economy responds to a yearlong campaign by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> to push up interest rates and cool the economy to restrain inflation. The government's main forecasting gauge of future economic activity, the Index of Leading Economic Indicators, was expected to show an increase for January. The report was scheduled to be released today. `` Growth will be very robust this quarter, but starting next quarter, I fully expect to see the effects of the higher interest rates,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, head of a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> consulting firm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON>, dean of the School of Business and Management at <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said economic reports so far this year give `` no indication that the economy is going to weaken substantially in the next half-year.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> last week intensified its anti-inflation fight, boosting its key bank lending rate a half-percentage point to 7 percent, in an effort to rein in accelerating inflation. At the same time, major banks boosted their prime rate, charged to their most creditworthy commercial customers, by a half-point to 11 percent, the second increase in two weeks. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s latest round of credit-tightening came as concerns about inflation had heightened with word that consumer prices rose 0.6 percent in January and wholesale prices rose 1 percent. Today's release of the leading index marks its first issue in a revised format. The revisions dropped two of 11 components from the index, revised two others, and added two new indicators of economic activity. Using data stretching back to 1948, the composite index has correctly predicted all eight recessions by dropping for at least three months in a row, but it also forecast four recessions that never materialized. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Moran </PERSON>, a spokesman for the government's <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Analysis </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday the changes make the index less prone to after-the-fact revision, less apt to make false predictions of future downturns and more precise at predicting when downturns will occur. A bureau study of how the new index would have done if it had been used in the past showed that its performance would have been similar to that of the old index. The two new indicators are a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> survey of consumer optimism and the measure evaluating manufacturers' unfilled orders. The components that were dropped _ changes in outstanding credit and the change in inventories on hand and on order _ were scrapped mainly because up-to-date data has not been available when the index first was compiled for a particular month. The index for that month was later revised to include the updated information.

<HEAD>Mexico To Reduce Crude Exports 5 Percent On April 1</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY ISAAC A. LEVI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> announced Friday it is reducing crude oil exports by 5 percent beginning April 1 in a coordinated move with other producers in an effort to buttress prices on the world market. Crude exports will be cut by an average of 68,600 barrels a day from the current average of 1.37 million, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mines </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. `` With this, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> fully acknowledges that strengthening the oil market is a joint responsibility by producers and consumers, since everyone benefits from a stable market and -LRB- fair -RRB- prices,'' it said. The statement did not give a time frame for the reduction but a source at <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION>, the state petroleum monopoly, said the cut will probably be maintained at least until the end of the year, depending on world market conditions. The cut was tentatively agreed upon Feb. 21 at a conference by <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> _ the world's fourth biggest producer and sixth largest exporter _ and the five other non-OPEC producers in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Two weeks of consultations and negotiations followed on the details. At the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> conference, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> proposed to cut exports by 5 percent provided the other non-OPEC nations did the same. The agreement came after the 13 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> agreed to cut exports during a meeting in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. Participating in the talks at the <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> were <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> and the state of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> province of <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION> sent observers. Although <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> refuses to join <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>, it has often used the international cartel's guidelines to set prices and export limits. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members <PERSON> Alberia </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gabon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> together were estimated to be producing in February about 19.5 million barrels a day. This was 1 million above their agreed production limit but well below their fourth-quarter production last year. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> has set a target price of $ 18 a barrel for the second quarter of this year. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s production averages 2.5 million barrels a day, and about half of it is exported to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, its principal customer in the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, buys about 180,000 barrels daily. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> also imports 56,000 barrels a day from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for its northern border region to save transportation costs. On Wednesday, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> reduced prices of its light Isthmus to <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and its extra-light Olmec to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by 10 cents a barrel, but kept the price of its heavy Maya crude unchanged. Olmec, which <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> began producing in mid-1988, is sold only to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION> establishes its prices by region, using a formula based on average prices on so-called world `` spot'' markets, where oil is auctioned to the highest bidder. But it sells only to fast customers under contract of one year or more. Thus, the price of Maya to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> averaged $ 12.38 a barrels during the first half of January, while Isthmus averaged $ 15.86 and Olmec $ 16.80. In <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Maya </PERSON> averaged $ 11.52 and Isthmus $ 15.71 a barrel and in the Far East Maya averaged $ 12.20 and Isthmus $ 14.85, according to <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION> figures.

<HEAD>CBOT Seeks Greater Accountability After Targeting by Federal Probe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, whose trading is under federal investigation, Friday announced measures to provide greater accountability and a better audit trail of floor trades. The <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors unanimously approved implementation of nine `` enhancements'' of the exchange's surveillance system, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowley </PERSON> The measures were approved after disclosure last month of a 2-year undercover federal probe into suspected illegal trading practices at the <ORGANIZATION> BOT </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. No indictments have yet been announced as a result of the ongoing investigation, in which <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents have posed as traders to look into allegations of pre-arranged trades and other illegal practices. `` The timing, obviously, has some ties to the investigation,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> official who asked not to be identified. `` But they -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> directors -RRB- have been making changes to improve the system since it went in three years ago.'' <PERSON> Crowley </PERSON> said most of the measures involve changes in the time-reporting system. Traders record trades within 30-minute windows on cards that are collected at 10:30 a.m. CST and again at the close of business in each trading pit. The new measures would double the number of windows, make them 15-minute sessions, and require collection of traders' cards hourly. Finally, the clocks of all brokerage houses operating at the exchange would be sychronized with the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>'s floor clock, ensuring greater uniformity in time-stamping trades. In another development, both the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> have asked member traders not to respond to a Wall Street Journal survey requesting opinions on the federal probe. <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> officials sent out a five-page letter urging members to beware of the `` deviously phrased'' survey. The letter also cites `` defects'' in 10 of the survey's 12 questions that <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> officials said are calculated to produce a `` distorted story.'' Board of Trade officials, meanwhile, told members that any survey responses `` may undermine our efforts to reinforce investor confidence in the integrity of our markets.'' The survey asked traders for their opinions on <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> tactics, on whether there was cheating at the exchanges and to what extent, and the effectiveness of internal disciplinary actions. A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, publisher of the Journal called the survey a `` standard reporting technique.''

<HEAD>Chrysler Slow To Pay Settlement In Odometer Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s delay in mailing settlement checks in a disconnected odometer case has cost the automaker loyal customers, some consumers said. The automaker negotiated the settlement with officials in 45 states more than 14 months ago. The agreement came after a federal grand jury charged two company employees with conspiring to sell more than 60,000 vehicles whose odometers were disconnected while they were driven by <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> officials. Consumers who bought the vehicles were supposed to receive $ 500 each, but the checks never went in the mail. `` If they had sent me the $ 500 I probably would have gone right out and bought another <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Doris </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Grosse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pointe </ORGANIZATION> said. `` But my husband went out and bought a Sterling and it runs like a dream. They lost a longtime customer.'' Many consumers say they have n't even received a claim form that they were told last August would be mailed to them shortly thereafter, the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. `` ` Shortly thereafter' in court terms can mean anywhere from one to two years,'' said <PERSON> Marcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Darling-Aud </PERSON>, a court employee at <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. The biggest problem at the moment is identifying all those entitled to receive the settlement checks, <PERSON> Darling-Aud </PERSON> said.

That means the eventual settlement may be more than $ 500, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Grain Futures End Mostly Lower; Corn Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Wheat, oats and soybean futures prices closed lower Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> but corn finished mixed in response to a lower-than-expected forecast for Argentine corn production. In a day of subdued trading, most of the selling was attributed to pre-weekend profit-taking after Thursday's steep rally in the soybean market, which raised prices to a 4-week high. Crop futures also were pressured by reports of widespread precipitation in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and the Plains, and by forecasts for more snow and rain during the weekend. The precipitation will help recharge soil parched by last summer's drought and provide protective snow cover for some of the winter wheat crop. Support for the corn market stemmed from the <ORGANIZATION> Argentine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s estimate Thursday of a 4.77 million-metric-ton corn harvest this spring. The estimate compares with last year's harvest of 8.88 million metric tons. The crop suffered heavy drought damage, effectively eliminating <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> as a major corn exporter during the 1989-90 crop year. At the close, wheat was 1 \ cents to 3 -RCB- cents lower with the contract for delivery in March at $ 4.32 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 1 cent lower to 2 -RCB- cents higher with March at $ 2.78 \ a bushel; oats were 2 cents to 4 -LCB- cents lower with March at $ 2.05 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were -LCB- cent to 7 \ cents lower with March at $ 7.67

 The stock market showed some scattered gains today in an indecisive session. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 8.04 to 2,273.75 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street. Gainers outnumbered losers by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 780 up, 587 down and 524 unchanged. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that the index of leading economic indicators rose 0.6 percent in January, in line with advance estimates on the Street. The figures elicited no strong response from the bond market, where prices were mixed. In the absence of any stimulus from that direction, brokers said, money managers at investing institutions continued some selective buying of stocks in the hopes of showing good results when they make their first-quarter reports to clients at the end of this month. But otherwise, traders seemed reluctant to make any big commitments. <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> fell ~ to 27.

 The anxiety of passengers and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> employees was evident Friday at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> terminals and in the air as the midnight deadline loomed for a strike against the ailing carrier. Operations seemed to be running normally at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s terminal at <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and there was no evidence of additional police presence Friday morning. But bitter employees were vocal about <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> management and pessimistic about the prospects for a last-minute settlement of the dispute between <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and its Machinists union. `` There's tremendous anger'' at <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, the chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said a male flight attendant onboard an early morning run from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` I would rather see the airline burn to the ground'' than have it continue under current management, said the employee from <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, who has worked for Eastern for 11 years. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York-Miami </ORGANIZATION> flight, which had been overbooked, was delayed nearly an hour while flight attendants offered free round-trip tickets on Eastern to passengers willing to give up their seats. There were few takers, but precious minutes went by as the gamblers left the aircraft and seats were found for the passengers replacing them. At the terminal, Florida-bound passengers worried about getting back to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> quizzed ticket agents _ some of whom, at least, seemed to be making an extra effort to be courteous and upbeat. The check-in lines were fairly long but orderly and fast-moving. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> `` is in a class by himself,'' said one agent, who reported she had been besieged by questions from passengers. She expressed optimism, though, that an 11th-hour settlement could be reached to avert a strike, as happened in 1986 when former <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Borman </PERSON> sold the airline to <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>. Some passengers joked about the hardship of not being able to get back to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> when temperatures in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> were running at around 80 degrees. But others were anxious. A young woman on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York-Miami </ORGANIZATION> flight, due to take another <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> flight from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, on Saturday was worried that she and the 190-member tour group she was escorting would n't make it. `` If the pilots go on strike -LRB- with the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, this airline is finished,'' she said. `` I'd hate to see another <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> company go under; I would rather see their prices go up than a company go under.'' An <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> pilot riding `` jump seat'' on the flight _ not working but transiting to his next assignment _ insisted that a Machinists' strike against <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> ca n't be effective without the support of the pilots The pilots union at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> has balloted its members, but the results have n't yet been announced. `` I do n't think -LRB- Eastern management -RRB- has run the airline very well,'' the 10-year pilot said.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> decided today to stay out of the threatened <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> strike, rejecting a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> recommendation and leaving the problem to company and machinists' union negotiators who face a midnight deadline. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> refused to use his authority under provisions of the Railway Labor Act to appoint a presidential review panel to investigate the labor strife _ a step that would have automatically delayed a strike for 60 days. `` I have decided not to accept this recommendation,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in a statement released at mid-afternoon by the White House press office. `` The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> has for many months attempted unsuccessfully to bring the parties to an agreement,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` and I have no reason to believe that an additional investigation or the 60-day delay that would be entailed would produce such an agreement.'' In light of the well-publicized threats of a strike and related activities, he said, the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> `` will monitor the situation and will, in addition, take whatever steps are needed to protect the safety of the traveling public.'' `` I urge responsible labor officials not to try to influence resolution of this dispute by disrupting the nation's transportation system through secondary boycotts against uninvolved parties,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` Such boycotts would unfairly burden millions of citizens, not only affecting necessary travel but also affecting shipments of consumer goods and the ability of workers to earn a living.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> noted that secondary boycotts are not permitted in other areas of the economy. He said that if the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> dispute threatens to disrupt essential transportation services, he will ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to pass legislation `` making it unlawful to use secondary picketing and boycotts against neutral carriers.'' `` We can not allow an isolated labor-management dispute to disrupt the nation's transportation system,'' the president said. Eastern, meanwhile, sent its machinists home this morning, citing `` significant amounts of vandalism,'' and saying the action was intended to prevent sabotage in the hours before the strike deadline. A federal court order allowed the action. Federal mediators, who were meeting with the negotiators at an undisclosed <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> location, said the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> offer Thursday brought hope of a settlement in the 17-month-old dispute. `` They likely will meet pretty much all day,'' said <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bushnell </PERSON>. `` I expect it will go right up to the deadline if necessary.'' Eastern's chief operating officer in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, said machinists were given a paid holiday and told to return to work for shifts starting at 12:01 a.m. EST Saturday, after the strike deadline. `` This is not a lockout and is not an attempt to affect the bargaining,'' <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said at a news conference. He said management personnel would handle maintenance and other ground duties for the rest of the day. Eastern pilots, rejecting an unusual videotaped offer by airline owner <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> in separate contract negotiations, said Thursday they would refuse to cross machinist picket lines. Other unions also pledged support in a plan to block work at other airlines, railways and sea transport companies if a strike is called by the 8,500-member <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> local of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>. A federal judge in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> ordered against any sympathy strike at <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, but the union was seeking orders in another federal court here to allow such action. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met in the Oval Office for more than a half-hour with Labor Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>. The airline wanted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to stay out of it, saying it is losing $ 1 million a day and ca n't afford the delay. Eastern, owned by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, has pledged to keep operating if the machinists strike. The <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> and 33 senators led by Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., had asked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to act <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> said other union members should honor the Eastern pickets wherever they are legally set up. <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, who bought <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> in 1986, of `` finding it worth his while to purchase a good company and strip its assets, rather than operate it fairly and decently.'' The union accuses <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> of planning to sell off <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> assets or transfer them to non-union <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, also owned by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>, asked after the Eastern offer what the chances of a strike would be if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not act, said, `` about a 100 percent chance.'' <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> and other union leaders, at a news conference, said they doubted there would be any settlement because they believe <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> wants to dismantle the airline, which they said is worth about $ 500 million. The senators' letter, signed by 31 Democrats and <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> Sens. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Specter </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, said 60 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities in 27 states depend on Eastern for passenger and freight service. `` Any interruption in this service will result in a major disruption of interstate commerce,'' the letter said. Eastern flies about 100,000 people a day with an average of 1,040 daily flights. It has 250 airliners. The letter noted that no president has refused to act on a mediation board recommendation to call a special panel in an airline dispute. Other airlines contend their workers would be violating no-strike clauses in their contracts if they honored picket lines set up by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> strikers. On Thursday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Magnuson </PERSON> in St. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> granted a temporary restraining order to prevent <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s 21,000-member machinist union from staging a sympathy strike The judge said the order `` is in the best interest of the public'' to avoid disrupting flights. Union lawyers were asking <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to stop the airlines, including <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, from blocking picketing of other companies which it says is allowed in a 1987 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision affecting transportation companies. <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroads </ORGANIZATION>, said the group was calling on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to outlaw such secondary picketing. <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Claytor </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>, said the commuter railroad would continue limited operations in the event of a sympathy walkout in the face of Eastern picketing, but only for `` a day or two.'' If there is no picketing and Eastern air service stops, the railroad would add trains, he said. Eastern's machinists said the new company offer was an improvement but still called for pay cuts rather than pay increases. Eastern originally wanted to cut salaries and get other concessions from the union totaling $ 150 million. The union wanted $ 50 million in raises. `` The company is still looking for major concessions, but it's not $ 150 million,'' said union official <PERSON> Wally </PERSON> <PERSON> Haber </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> after the new offer Eastern said the contract would reduce mechanics' pay but still keep their salaries 13 percent higher than employees who took a 20 percent pay cut when <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> took over the company in 1986. It said baggage handlers' cuts would be no greater than those of other employees.

<HEAD>Laura Ashley Says U.S. Retailer Copying Its Goods</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Laura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ashley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> Friday charged <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retailer <ORGANIZATION> Limited </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> with copying the bottles and packaging design of perfumes sold by a <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> subsidiary. A suit filed in federal court in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> and its <ORGANIZATION> Penhaligon </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary seeks to stop <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON>'s Secret shops owned by Limited from selling perfumes in bottles and packaging designs that allegedly are direct copies of ones used by <PERSON> Penhaligon </PERSON>'s. The complaint says Limited and <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON>'s Secret produced the knock-off line after they were unsuccessful in their attempts to acquire <PERSON> Penhaligon </PERSON>'s. Besides seeking to stop the manufacture and sale of the perfumes, <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> is seeking an unspecified amount in monetary damages. A statement from <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON>, which is a British company that sells women's fashions, fabrics and some home furnishings, said the suit was filed as a claim of unfair competition under the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trademark law and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state law. <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> has been expanding its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presence in recent years. <PERSON> Penhaligon </PERSON>'s, also based in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, has been in business since the 1870s as a perfume retailer and was acquired by <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> in 1987. Its fragrance products are sold in about a dozen <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> department stores and to over 2,500 mail order customers. The statement said <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wexner </PERSON>, Limited's chairman, is one of the mail order customers. <PERSON> Penhaligon </PERSON>'s perfumes come in glass-stoppered bottles with an unusual shape. The company has been awarded Royal Warrants from the Duke of <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION> and the Prince of <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> and its perfume packaging bears seals to reflect the endorsements. The suit claims Limited and <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON>'s Secret have tried to simulate the Royal Warrant on their perfume packaging.

 The stock market posted some spotty gains today in a quiet session. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that the index of leading economic indicators rose 0.6 percent in January, in line with advance estimates on the Street. The figures elicited no strong response from the bond market, where prices were mixed. In the absence of any stimulus from that direction, brokers said, money managers at investing institutions continued some selective buying of stocks in the hopes of showing good results when they make their first-quarter reports to clients at the end of this month. But otherwise, traders seemed reluctant to make any big commitments.

 Energy futures prices declined in volatile trading Friday, with crude oil soaring toward the $ 19-a-barrel level before settling lower in a wave of technical selling. Refined petroleum products also lost ground. `` It was a volatile day,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Beutel </PERSON>, an energy analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Beutel </PERSON> said prices started out weak following reports that production among the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> had been higher than expected during January and February But he said the market started to rally later in the session after non-OPEC nations <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> announced 5 percent cuts in their oil output. Several non-OPEC nations had agreed at a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> conference last month to cut oil production in coordination with an earlier production pact between cartel members.

Traders said prices declined in a wave of technical selling after the WTI April contract failed to pierce the psychologically important $ 19-a-barrel level. Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange, the April contract for wholesale home heating oil settled 1.07 cents lower at 50.80 cents a gallon. April unleaded gasoline settled at 51.53 cents, down 0.68 cent.

<HEAD>MAI Basic Four Launches Proxy Fight For Prime Computer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Intensifying the battle to take over <ORGANIZATION> Prime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> MAI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Four </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it will wage a proxy fight for control of Prime's board of directors at the May 12 annual meeting. MAI Basic announced a slate of nominees for the election, which will fill all seven seats on the board by a majority vote of the stockholders represented at the meeting. Prime spokesman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Gavaghan </PERSON> said the announcement was `` not unanticipated'' and that Prime will urge shareholders to retain the current board. MAI Basic, a computer firm based in <LOCATION> Tustin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, launched a $ 20-per-share hostile bid for Prime in mid-November. The offer is valued at $ 970 million. In a prepared statement, <ORGANIZATION> MAI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basic </ORGANIZATION> said its slate of directors would be committed to selling Prime, a manufacturer of minicomputers and computer-aided design and manufacturing systems. Prime, which has headquarters in <LOCATION> Natick </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, issued a response saying <ORGANIZATION> MAI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basic </ORGANIZATION>'s bid `` continues to be highly conditional, unfinanced and extremely leveraged'' and that `` the price does not reflect the intrinsic value of Prime.'' MAI Basic's takeover offer has been enjoined since Dec. 9, when a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> ruled that MAI Basic had not disclosed sufficient information about its financing arrangements with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Shrinking Timber Supply Puts Squeeze On</HEAD>

<DATELINE>GRANTS PASS, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 E.P. `` Bud'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> shakes his head when he looks at all the mature <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> fir timber standing on federal lands in the <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> and thinks about how little he can saw down. `` There have been years when we had fires or weather problems, but nothing that has the long-range effect this has,'' said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> C </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> D </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lumber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Riddle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, and the fourth generation of his family in the lumber business. `` There's a tremendous resource out here. It's a shame we are n't using it more completely.'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> likes to have two years' worth of timber under contract, but can get only seven to eight months' worth. The people who run the lumber and plywood mills throughout the Northwest are facing a problem that just a few years ago seemed impossible: They are running out of trees to cut at a time when demand is high. `` Business will probably be reasonably decent for those who can get timber,'' said <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, timber consultant <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ehinger </PERSON>. `` What you are looking at is bankruptcies in the middle of prosperity, because there is a good demand.'' While a <ORGANIZATION> Portland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> study blames increased productivity for more than half the timber jobs lost from 1976 to 1986, <PERSON> Ehinger </PERSON> blames timber supply for the closure of 22 sawmills and 16 plywood mills in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> since the start of 1988. `` The simple fact is there is no timber around to run these mills,'' he said. `` There are a lot of them on shaky ground today.'' The squeeze is partly the result of an environmentalist battle to save the last of the old-growth forests, a lag in the reforestation of private lands and greater demand for raw logs overseas. As a result, average prices bid for <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> fir on national forests rose from $ 156.33 per thousand board feet in 1986 to $ 248.04 in 1988. In the past, private forests owned by big timber companies accounted for the bulk of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> timber. They had first pick when the land was up for grabs in the early 1900s, and the leftovers went to the national forests. The private lands largely have been cut over and reseeded, but the next generation of trees wo n't be ready for 20 to 50 years. That focuses attention on public lands, particularly national forests, where the best of the mature timber now stands. `` There are big clouds on the horizon and it's starting to rain,'' said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Olympia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION> `` As more and more federal lands are set aside for spotted owls and other types of wildlife and recreation areas, the land available for perpetual commercial timber management decreases.'' The national forests in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> turned out 31 percent of the region's 15.2 billion board feet of raw timber in 1987. They are about to release management plans for the next 10 years and the outlook is for less timber as they struggle to juggle the demands of their multiple-use mandate. The 1980s management plan allowed the annual harvest of up to 5.5 billion board feet. The new plan will allow 4.7 billion board feet, said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a senior <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> administrator for the Northwest. With more land reserved for wilderness and scenery, and foresters getting a better idea of where trees grow best, the commercial timber lands have shrunk from 17 million acres in 1978 to 14.5 million acres under the latest plans. `` We always had this thing of ` Go west, young man,''' said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. `` Now we find there's a <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> and we fell into it. `` What you see is what you've got. And everybody is scrambling to get their piece of that.'' <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>'s state forester, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, predicts overall timber supply will decline 10 percent by the year 2010. <PERSON> Ehinger </PERSON> foresees a 20 percent drop. From the environmentalists point of view, the shrinking timber harvest is good both for the forest and the Northwest economy. `` Our timber industry has been scaled back to the ability of the land to produce in the long term,'' said <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerr </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> stock jumped Friday after Business Week reported rival aerospace giant <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> may try to buy the company. The `` Inside Wall Street'' stock-tipping column in March 13 editions of the business newsweekly, published late Thursday and available on newsstands next week, quoted unidentified sources as saying <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> is keenly interested in <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION>'s enormous defense contracting business. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> rose $ 1.75 a share to $ 49.50 in consolidated trading. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> rose $ 1.62 -LCB- to $ 65.12 -LCB-. The column quoted an unidentified money manager as saying <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> can easily afford to buy <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> because it has $ 4.2 billion in cash with little debt. <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION>'s market value at its current price is about $ 3 billion, although a purchaser would likely have to pay more to acquire the shares. The column also said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s own military sales are n't expected to grow this year, whereas <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION>'s have grown 30 percent annually since 1982. Both companies declined to comment on takeover speculation. <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Calabasas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, is a leader in research, development and production of aerospace and defense products. Seattle-based <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> also is deeply involved in defense-related projects and is the undisputed leader in the commercial jetliner industry. <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> ranked eighth in defense contracts in fiscal 1988, with $ 3.54 billion, while <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> ranked 10th with $ 3 billion, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said this week. <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION>'s stock also jumped late last year when <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, through his majority-owned <ORGANIZATION> Valhi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, sought clearance from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to buy up to 15 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Valhi </ORGANIZATION> so far has acquired less than 1 percent of the stock.

 The dollar declined against several key currencies in domestic dealings Friday after a mixed performance overseas. Gold prices rose. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a bid of $ 386.30 for a troy ounce of gold at 4 p.m. EST, up from $ 383.50 late Thursday. Currency dealers described trading as trendless, with little news to influence the dollar's movement. However, they said a sentiment persisted among market participants that efforts to relieve inflationary pressures, including increases in interest rates, may affect exchange rates soon. `` The market was basically featureless the last few days,'' said <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON>, manager of foreign exchange trading at the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> operation in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` We're waiting for some information to push the dollar out of the recent range.'' In European currency markets, dealers said the Bank of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> bought sterling several times during the session in a bid to maintain the British currency's exchange rate, but the action failed to prevent a fall. The pound ended the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> business day at $ 1.7240, cheaper for buyers than Thursday's $ 1.7270 and its lowest level in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> since Oct. 11. But later, in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, sterling fetched $ 1.72025, up from $ 1.7125 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Thursday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with Thursday's levels, included: 1.8437 West German marks, down from 1.8474; 1.57515 Swiss francs, down from 1.5824; 1.19505 Canadian dollars, up from 1.19485; 6.2645 French francs, down from 6.2880; and 1,358.00 Italian lire, down from 1,361.33 Other late rates for the dollar in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> compared with Thursday's late rates were: 1.8415 West German marks, up from 1.8405; 1.5765 Swiss francs, up from 1.5710; 6.2600 French francs, up from 6.2575; 2.0770 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0735; 1,358.75 Italian lire, down from 1,360.50; and, 1.1935 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1945. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar closed at 128.12 Japanese yen, up from 128.07 yen late Thursday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> late Friday the dollar was trading lower, at 127.98 yen, and at 127.815 yen in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, down from 128.435 Thursday. Gold and silver prices gained. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold bullion for current delivery closed at $ 386.60 a troy ounce compared to $ 383.80 on Thursday. The late bid price for gold in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> was $ 386.25 a troy ounce, up from $ 383.75. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the late bid price was $ 386.30, up from $ 383.25.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> approved rule changes Thursday designed to give investors faster notice when corporate auditors turn up fraud or other irregularities. Under the previous rules, a company had up to 15 days to report the resignation of its auditor in a dispute and an additional 30 days after that to make public a letter from the auditor outlining the disagreement. The new rule, approved on a 4-0 vote, requires companies to report the resignation of an auditor within five days and to file the auditor's letter with the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> within 10 days, thus tightening up the disclosure period from 45 days to 15 days. The changes come more than a year after members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> complained about the rule during a January 1988 hearing on the notorious ZZZZ Best fraud case. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON>, a teenage <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> financial wizard, parlayed a rug-cleaning business based in his parents' garage into a multimillion-dollar, publicly traded corporation. <ORGANIZATION> ZZZZ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Best </ORGANIZATION>'s independent auditor, <ORGANIZATION> Ernst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Whinney </ORGANIZATION>, discovered irregularities and resigned on June 2, 1986. But, the firm's suspicions were n't made public until July 16, 1986 In the meantime, unwitting investors continued to buy <ORGANIZATION> ZZZZ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Best </ORGANIZATION> stock, which became worthless. Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON>, D-Ore., had been pressing for even faster disclosure of irregularities turned up by accountants, by requiring the accountants to go directly to the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> with their suspicions But, <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> told <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON> at a hearing last year the commission lacked the power to require reports directly from auditors. <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> said he would support a change in the law giving the commission that power. The commission plans to publish its new rules within several weeks. They would become effective 30 days after that. <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleischman </PERSON> expressed concern that the tightened deadline would create a burden on firms, but the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> staff said there had been only about a half dozen cases within the past six months that would have been affected.

<HEAD>Merc Signs French Futures Exchange to Globex</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The French futures exchange <PERSON> Marche </PERSON> a <ORGANIZATION> Terme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to join <ORGANIZATION> Globex </ORGANIZATION>, an off-hours electronic trading system being developed by the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, officials said Thursday. The French exchange, which is known by its acronym <ORGANIZATION> MATIF </ORGANIZATION>, is the third outside exchange to announce its intention to join <ORGANIZATION> Globex </ORGANIZATION> and offer products for trading on the system. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, which trades primarily oil and platinum futures, and the <ORGANIZATION> Sydney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Australia </ORGANIZATION> previously announced plans to join <ORGANIZATION> Globex </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> MATIF </ORGANIZATION> is <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s highest-volume futures exchange and the first in the European time zones to join <ORGANIZATION> Globex </ORGANIZATION>. It lists a variety of financial and commodity futures including a French government bond futures contract and a stock-index futures contract based on 40 stocks traded on the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Bourse stock exchange. <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Melamed </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>'s executive committee, said the addition of the French exchange to <ORGANIZATION> Globex </ORGANIZATION> would give the system a partner in each of the world's three major time zones, making <ORGANIZATION> Globex </ORGANIZATION> `` the worldwide transaction system it set out to become.'' The automated system, which is expected to become operational this fall, will use a computer to match buy and sell orders during the hours that the member exchanges' trading floors are closed. The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>, the world's second-largest futures exchange, and London-based <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION> announced plans to create the system in 1987. Futures are contracts to buy or sell a commodity or financial instrument at an agreed-upon price at a specified future date. The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest futures exchange, announced last month that it was developing its own automated off-hours trading system to compete with <ORGANIZATION> Globex </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Supply Fears Fuel 5-Day Copper Rally</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Persistent supply concerns pushed copper futures prices sharply higher Friday on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, capping a weeklong rally that boosted copper by more than 10 percent. On other exchanges, precious metals also advanced; energy futures retreated; pork bellies plummeted, leading livestock futures lower; and grains and soybeans were mixed. Copper settled 2.4 cents to 5.6 cents higher with the most active contract, for delivery in May, at $ 1.437 a pound. The spot March contract finished at $ 1.53 a pound compared with the spot settlement price of $ 1.386 a pound a week earlier. Prices rose despite an apparent reduction in tensions between Peruvian copper miners and the government. In <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, the world's sixth-largest copper-producing nation, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> continued plans for a 3-day `` warning strike'' beginning March 26. The miners contend the government has not honored the agreement that ended a 57-day strike late last year. The union said Friday it was willing to accept some compromises in the interim before the strike, although workers did not rule out possibly extending the strike beyond three days. Copper's underlying supply-and-demand factors remained overwhelmingly bullish, with near-term availability extremely limited going into the second quarter, historically a period of heavy consumption. `` We have a convergence of the technical, fundamental and seasonal factors,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, research director with <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` This is an extremely positive period for the market.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> reported that copper supplies deliverable against the March contract increased by 113 tons Thursday to 17,446 tons. But analysts said copper stocks are so low that the increase had scant market impact. Precious-metals futures prices rose amid fears that a strike in the industrial-metals section of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Rustenburg </LOCATION> mining complex could spread to the platinum sector. <LOCATION> Rustenburg </LOCATION> is the world's largest platinum mine. A drop in the dollar's value against other major currencies also contributed to the rise in precious metal values, analysts said. Platinum settled $ 5.40 to $ 5.60 higher on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> with April at $ 539.30 a troy ounce. On the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, gold settled $ 2.70 to $ 3.20 higher with April at $ 389.30 a troy ounce; silver was 3.9 cents to 4.8 cents higher with March at $ 5.801 a troy ounce. Energy futures traded higher for most of the session on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> but finished lower after a late wave of profit-taking that erased nearly half of the previous day's strong gains in the crude oil market. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 16 cents to 22 cents lower with April at $ 18.56 a barrel; heating oil was .59 cent to 1.07 cents lower with April at 50.80 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .36 cent to .72 cent lower with April at 51.53 cents a gallon. Heavy profit-taking in the pork belly market led the decline in livestock and meat futures prices on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The March belly contract plummeted 2 cents a pound, the maximum daily price change permitted by the exchange. Live cattle settled .20 cent to .55 cent lower with April at 77.80 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .45 cent lower with March at 82.42 cents a pound; live hogs were .40 cent lower to .08 cent higher with April at 44.15 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 2 cents lower to .48 cent higher with March at 37.25 cents a pound. Wheat, oats and soybean futures prices settled mostly lower on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> but corn finished mixed in response to a lower-than-expected forecast for Argentine corn production. Most of the selling was triggered by profit-taking the soybean market, which soared to a 4-week high on Thursday. Wheat settled 1 -LCB- cents to 3 -LCB- cents lower with March at $ 4.32 -RCB- a bushel; corn was 1 cent lower to 2 -RCB- cents higher with March at $ 2.78 \ a bushel; oats were 2 -LCB- cents to 4 cents lower with March at $ 2.05 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 8 cents lower to -LCB- cent higher with March at $ 7.67 -RCB- a bushel

<HEAD>Bond Prices Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Bond prices were mixed Friday in lackluster trading, finishing little changed despite early declines in the face of an overnight drop by the dollar. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s benchmark 30-year bond was down 1-16 point late Friday. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, was unchanged from late Thursday at 9.12 percent. After surging Thursday, bond prices opened sharply lower in response to the dollar's decline overnight in foreign exchange overseas, analysts said. A declining dollar hurts bond prices by reducing yields available to foreign investors, who are sizeable holders of dollar-denominated debt. The market recovered some ground after reports that <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> was making payments on its $ 33 billion foreign debt conditional on the success of its government austerity program. The dollar finished lower, but did not drag the bond market with it, analysts said. Bonds were little affected by the government's report that the Index of Leading Economic Indicators rose 0.6 percent in January, while orders to factories for manufactured goods dropped 1.3 percent. `` There was no surprise there _ no news,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>. `` It looks like we're sitting and waiting for the next piece of news.'' In the secondary market for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds, prices of short-term governments ranged from unchanged to up 1-16 point, intermediate maturities were up 1-32 point and long-term issues were unchanged to down 1-16 point, according to <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the financial information service. The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $ 10 in the price of a bond with a $ 1,000 face value. The <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Bond Index, which measures price movements on all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues with maturities of a year or longer, was down 0.10 at 1,122.28. In corporate trading, industrials were higher. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, rose 0.16 to 296.88. In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds fell 3-32 point. The average yield to maturity fell to 7.74 percent from 7.75 percent late Thursday. Yields on three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills fell to 8.92 percent as the discount fell 3 basis points to 8.62 percent. Yields on six-month blls inched up to 9.17 percent as the discount gained 1 basis point at 8.66 percent. Yields on one-year bills dropped to 9.32 percent as the discount fell 2 basis points to 8.62 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the annualized return on an investment in a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bill. The discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at maturity. The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was quoted at 9 -LCB- percent, down from 913-16 percent late Thursday.

<HEAD>Coniston Revises TW Services Bid, Plans to Run for Board Seats</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it was dropping a key condition from its $ 1.4 billion offer for <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and said it planned to wage a proxy fight for seats on the food services company's board. In a letter to <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Salizzoni </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partner </ORGANIZATION> principal <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tierney </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said his group was dropping a condition of its $ 29-a-share offer that the <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> board approve the proposed merger. The revision came a day after a <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> refused to void <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>' `` poison-pill'' anti-takeover defense. Another Coniston principal, <PERSON> Augustus </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON>, said the court acted partly because of the merger approval condition. He said by dropping that provision <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> can return to court on the poison pill issue. He said <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> hoped for a speedy response to the revised offer from <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. In a statement, <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> said, `` We acknowledge receipt of the amended offer and the board of directors will respond in due course.'' In the letter, <PERSON> Tierney </PERSON> said that in the event that <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> fails to `` respond expeditiously to negotiate in good faith with us or to conduct a full and fair auction of the company, we intend to renew our motion to redeem the ` poison pill' in Chancery Court.'' Under the poison pill, <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> shareholders would be allowed to purchase additional stock in the company at a steep discount in the event of a hostile takeover. With more stock outstanding, the cost of acquiring the company would rise sharply. <PERSON> Tierney </PERSON> also said in his letter that his group intends to `` file all preliminary documents necessary'' to begin the process of having its nominess elected to the TW Services board. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, said three seats are up for election at the company's April 26 meeting. The board currently has 11 members. <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> launched a tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> last October. It already owns about about 19 percent of <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>' 48.5 million shares. <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> owns 1,200 <PERSON> Denny </PERSON>'s restaurants and 400 <ORGANIZATION> Hardee </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> restaurants, among other properties

<TEXT>
 The city's affirmative action-minority enterprise program was overturned Thursday by the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which said officials failed to produce enough evidence of past discrimination to justify it. The court also unanimously found that the <ORGANIZATION> Minority-Female </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> program, begun in 1975, was too broadly drawn and failed to consider alternatives to a yearly minority participation goal in city contracting. The program sets a goal of 35 percent of city contract dollars go to minorities. City officials declined comment on the ruling and its implications for the program, one of the nation's most recognized and most emulated. `` It is apparent the city had available to it less intrusive means of accomplishing the <ORGANIZATION> MFBE </ORGANIZATION>'s race-conscious purposes but had not fully explored those,'' Justice <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> B. <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> wrote for the seven-member court. It was not immediately clear whether the ruling on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Subcontractors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> effectively dismantles the program. City Attorney <PERSON> Marva </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> said an appeal is unlikely, but she said unspecified steps would be taken to save the minority program. Mayor <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> scheduled a news conference for noon Friday to discuss the ruling. <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Strong </PERSON>, the city's Contract Compliance director, said he expected that the city would declare a bidding moratorium for a few months on all city contracts, except for emergency situations, while a new program is developed. Among those pleased with the ruling was <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Southeastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, an Atlanta-based public-interest center that joined the lawsuit against the city. `` This means city contracts in the future must be let on a truly competitive basis, with no entrepreneur, black or white, receiving preference,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s program has grown steadily since it was created in 1975 by then-Mayor <PERSON> Maynard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. Some consider it one of the nation's most well-monitored and carefully designed programs of its type The city could appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. But in January the nation's highest court overturned a similar program in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. Still, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> officials hoped their program would survive. `` I think there are a number of differences between our case and the <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> case,'' Mayor <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said in January. `` It's the difference between a law based on the spirit of fairness and a law that seems to mandate'' minority set-asides. Last year, the city of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> awarded $ 29.4 million to minority-owned and operated companies, 36.7 percent of all city contracting business. More than $ 300 million in city business has gone to minority companies since the 35 percent minority participation goal was established in 1975. <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> DeKalb </LOCATION> counties have goals of 20 percent minority participation in country contracts. Their programs were not affected by the ruling Thursday.

 Car and truck sales in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> slipped 10.5 percent during February, led downward by a 30.7 percent decline in <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> car sales during the last week of the month, automakers reported Friday. Sales of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and imported cars and light trucks showed declines for late February, for the entire month and for the first two months of this year compared with the corresponding periods of 1988. During the Feb. 21-28 period, car and truck sales reported by the eight domestic vehicle producers were down 14.3 percent this year compared with the same time last year. Vehicles sold at an average daily rate of 46,336 during the period this year, compared with a daily rate of 54,044 vehicles during late February last year. Industry insiders have predicted that 1989 sales will be softer than in 1988, the second-best calendar sales year on record. Part of the reason for the good year last year were strong sales during January and February due to heavy use of incentives. Incentives have been in effect this year, but on a smaller number of cars and light trucks. The sales slides in late February and for the month surprised analyst <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Healy </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` They came in lower than I expected,'' he said, adding that some incentives for <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> ended during the last part of the month. `` It's leaving the industry with a lot of inventory.'' <PERSON> Healy </PERSON> estimated that <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> had 85 days' worth, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> 88 and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> 84. On Friday, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> announced it was extending for two more weeks a shutdown of its <LOCATION> Doraville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, assembly plant, which makes Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme cars. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> blamed the extended shutdown, which affected 4,000 workers, on high inventories. `` We've got too many cars out in the field,'' said <LOCATION> Doraville </LOCATION> plant manager <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>. Among the nation's Big Three automakers, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> alone showed increased sales during late February, the month or during the first two months of the year. But those gains were tiny. The nation's No. 2 automaker said it sold cars at a daily rate of 8,755 during late February this year, up 0.4 percent from the 8,721 daily rate during the same period last year. For the month, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s car sales slipped 2.3 percent and for the year, the company is selling cars at a rate 0.5 percent higher than the same time last year <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s sales of domestic cars skidded 30.7 percent during late February. Analysts and company officials have said the nation's No 3 automaker is suffering a bit from having too little variety in its product lineup. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s monthly sales were off 26.8 percent last month when compared with February a year ago. Car sales during the first two months at <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> are at a pace 18.4 percent below last year's during the same time. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s domestic car sales also fell dramatically compared with last year, dropping 25.4 percent in late February, 17.1 percent for the entire month and 14.6 percent for the first two months of the year.

 <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> indicated Friday it has been phasing highly saturated tropical oils out of its products since 1987, responding to a multimillionaire health activist's recent attacks on the cookie and cracker maker over the issue In a letter to <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, Neb.-based activist <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Sokolof </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> executive stated the company actively has been seeking to reduce the amount of saturated fats in its products. `` Specifically, on the fats of interest to you _ Tropical Oils and Lard _ we are committed to their removal from our products as expeditiously as technology and testing allow; in fact, we believe that we have led our industry in both the timing and number of products that we already have reformulated,'' wrote <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Manfredi </PERSON>, a senior vice president. Saturated fats can increase blood cholesterol levels; high cholesterol is a risk factor for heart attacks. <PERSON> Sokolof </PERSON>, 66, blames high cholesterol for the near-fatal heart attack he suffered 22 years ago. <PERSON> Sokolof </PERSON> said, after a phone conversation Thursday evening with <PERSON> Manfredi </PERSON>, that he had gotten the assurances he wanted. <PERSON> Manfredi </PERSON> followed up with the letter on Friday. `` Yesterday was the first unequivocal announcement,'' <PERSON> Sokolof </PERSON> said in a phone interview. `` I am elated.'' <PERSON> Sokolof </PERSON> says he has spent $ 2 million of his own money on his cholesterol-awareness campaign. In November he placed his first series of full-page ads in five newspapers warning of the dangers of tropical oils such as palm and coconut oil and listing brands that contained them. Since then, 11 other food giants, including <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mills </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oats </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Kellogg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, have announced they will drop tropical oils from some products. The latest ads, which ran Tuesday in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, singled out East Hanover-based Nabisco for lagging behind the nation's other major food companies in announcing they were changing their recipes to phase out the offending oils. <PERSON> Sokolof </PERSON> said more than 60 of the company's products have lard or tropical oil. The ad featured an array of Nabisco products including Triscuit, Ritz crackers, Fig Newtons, Oreos, Premium and <PERSON> Barnum </PERSON>'s Animals crackers <PERSON> Manfredi </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Friday that <PERSON> Nabisco </PERSON> some 2 -LCB- years ago began `` a very active program'' ago to determine what could be done to remove highly saturated fats from food. <PERSON> Manfredi </PERSON> said <PERSON> Nabisco </PERSON> on Monday would start making tropical oil-free Triscuit crackers, the last of the company's 100-item cracker line containing the fat. <PERSON> Manfredi </PERSON> said only three of 35 new products introduced in the last two years have lard or tropical oils, and many of <PERSON> Nabisco </PERSON>'s popular products have been reformulated to exclude them

 President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> on Friday blamed rioting that killed 300 people on the crushing burden of foreign debt and said <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> can keep making loan payments only if his austerity program succeeds. <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> owes foreign creditors $ 33 billion. On Friday, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced he would provide the country with a $ 450 million loan to help the struggling South American nation meet its short-term financial needs. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> told reporters that the four days of disturbances caused by price increases could occur in other Latin American countries. `` The crisis Latin American nations are undergoing has a name written with capital letters _ foreign debt,'' he said at a news conference. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> also bitterly criticized industrialized nations for giving little or no help to support democratic governments. <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> announced Friday it would send a $ 50 million loan to help <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> recover from the rioting. The unrest was caused by government-imposed bus fare increases, which appeared to release pent-up frustration over its austerity program. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> on Friday to express concern and support for <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>'s `` courageous and determined efforts to address his country's economic and financial situation. Later, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials disclosed that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was making the $ 450 million loan to help ease the financial crisis facing <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>' 29-day-old government <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> confirmed that at least 300 people had been killed and 2,000 injured since Monday. He put the number of arrests at `` barely 1,000.'' Newspaper reports estimated the death toll at 300 to 400, and said more than 2,000 had been arrested in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> alone. Martial law remained in effect Friday with a dusk-to-dawn curfew forcing stores to restrict opening hours. Soliers patrolled <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> on foot and in armored cars, and there was sporadic gunfire. However, the capital of 4 million people appeared to be returning to normal. Buses and subways ran regularly and downtown streets were crowded. Joggers were seen in parks early in the morning. Long lines still formed outside grocery stores, but the government set up distribution centers to relieve food shortages. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> linked the bloodiest civil unrest in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s history to the burden of foreign debt and said it was jeopardizing a new wave of democracy sweeping Latin American. He accused industrialized nations of inflexibility in demanding repayment of the region's $ 420 billion foreign debt without regard to a nation's ability to pay. `` I hope this painful sacrifice by our country will serve for the leaders of the industrial powers to reflect that we are not exaggerating when we say the crisis is serious,'' he said. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said whether <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> can continue to make principal and interest payments on its $ 33 billion foreign debt depends on the success of his austerity program. In a question-and-answer session with reporters, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> appeared to indicate that <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> had already suspended the debt payments. However, a senior <LOCATION> Venezuelan </LOCATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said later that `` there was an honest difference of opinion over interpretation'' of <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>' remarks, and stressed that <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> would continue to make the payments at least until the end of the month. <PERSON> Edgard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leal </PERSON>, the country's chief debt negotiator, also said <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> would continue to make payments. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, who came to office just one month ago, was referring to economic austerity measures required under an agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> exchange </ORGANIZATION> for a $ 4.3 billion loan over the next three years. Earlier this week, the government asked the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> to include provisions allowing <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> to suspend all payments on its debt until September. <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> also asked for an additional $ 4.3 billion in loans from the institution in the next three years. <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s austerity program includes price increases for a range of basic goods and services, including bus fares, food, gasoline and electricity. <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> is one of the few developing nations that has been servicing foreign debt, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said, complaining that Western banks had not recognized the effort by granting new loans. Oil-producing <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> has for decades been one of the wealthiest and politically stable nations in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. But a continuing fall in world oil prices, combined with debt payments, has depleted monetary reserves, creating the economic crisis. Real wages have since then fallen by a third since 1981, and inflation is expected to double this year to 70 percent. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> could expect six months of economic hardship. But after that, he said, the economy will start to expand. He said there was no immediate threat to Venezuelan stability, but warned that prolonged economic decline could `` undermine the foundations of democracy.''
