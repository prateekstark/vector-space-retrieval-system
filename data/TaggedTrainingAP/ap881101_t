 Two policemen were killed Tuesday in a shootout with a fugitive bank robber on a restaurant terrace in this <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> coastal town, police said. The fugitive, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>, was seriously injured.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday granted the Army an air pollution emission permit to burn Pershing II missile motors at its Pueblo depot to comply with an arms reduction treaty. The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> had been seeking the state permit since February, because the missiles must be destroyed under terms of the Intermediate Nuclear Forces treaty signed by leaders of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The permit imposes some restrictions on the method, frequency and wind conditions for missile destruction at the depot in southern <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Clouse </PERSON> of the department's Air Pollution Control Division. It also requires emissions monitoring for the three years the permit will be in effect, beginning on the first day of missile destruction. `` Under these conditions, there will be no adverse impact to <LOCATION> Pueblo </LOCATION> residents or to the residents east of the site,'' said <PERSON> Clouse </PERSON>. Gov. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> praised the department for allowing the burn `` while, at the same time, protecting our environment and the health of our citizens.'' `` I wanted <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> to help get rid of these missiles so that this country could fulfill its treaty obligation,'' <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> said. `` However, I wanted it to be done safely, and we have worked that out with the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Army.'' Slated for destruction at the depot are 234 Pershing II Stage I motors, each of which contains 7,940 pounds of propellant, and 223 Pershing II Stage 2 motors, each of which contains 4,940 pounds of propellant, state officials said. The rest of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s original stockpile of 849 Pershing II missiles will be destroyed at a site in <LOCATION> Marshall </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> officials said. `` We're very pleased. We're grateful to the citizens and the state of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> for the confidence they have placed in us. And rest assured, we do n't take that confidence lightly,'' said <PERSON> Pueblo </PERSON> depot spokesman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenitzer </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kenitzer </PERSON> said depot officials will travel to <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> in the next few days to pick up the permit, and the depot will send the health department a check later this week for about $ 25,000 for research and administrative costs. He said the Army will select a date to begin the missile burns and, under treaty terms, will give the Soviets 30 days' notice. Some state lawmakers had been concerned that if the state denied the permit, jobs at the facility might be in jeopardy. <PERSON> Kenitzer </PERSON> did n't know immediately whether the depot might hire more people as a result of the permit.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaigned like a president-to-be Tuesday, saying he hoped for a meeting with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> soon after moving into the Oval Office. Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said `` Made in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' was the only label he cared about as he bid for union support. The polls one week before Election Day showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a solid leader, and the contrast in campaign styles between the front-runner and the underdog could n't have been plainer. The vice president struck an above-the-fray pose in a speech at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Notre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dame </ORGANIZATION>, saying he wanted to meet <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> for a `` serious and direct examination'' of superpower relations. The GOP presidential nominee also pledged to appoint `` moderate persons of conservative views'' to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was in the political trenches, blending his appeal for blue collar support with an attack on alleged Republican influence peddling. `` As president, I'm not going to stand up for the sharp operators, I'm going to stand up for the lathe operators and machine operators,'' he said. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign also unveiled a new one-minute ad centering on the theme `` The Rich Get Richer'' and claiming <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' tax proposals would be fairer to the middle class. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' aides said their private polls pointed to a race that was narrowing. Privately, some Democrats expressed doubts, while <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> said its survey of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a leader by seven points in the nation's biggest state. A CBS News poll released Tuesday showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> holding a 12-point lead over <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, 53-41 percent. The survey of 1,065 probable voters was conducted Saturday through Monday and had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had an even larger lead in an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> poll, 55-42, which the network said was the largest lead in its polling since Labor Day. The survey of 1,099 likely voters Wednesday through Monday had a margin of error of close to four percentage points in either direction. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate, expressed irritation with <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> campaign managers after they abruptly switched his schedule to cancel a trip to South Bend, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>. _ the same city <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was visiting. Democratic vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> climbed into the cockpit of an F-16 fighter for the benefit of television cameras as he renewed his campaign to persuade Texans that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would be strong on defense. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> campaigned for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and other Republicans, ripping into <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for describing himself as a liberal in the mold of <LOCATION> Roosevelt </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is no `` <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> and he's no FDR,'' the outgoing president said _ and then depicted this year's <ORGANIZATION> Democatic </ORGANIZATION> candidate as a man pursuing the `` Carter-Mondale liberal agenda. Transition planners were on a schedule that could n't wait for the election. Stationery bearing the politically correct letterhead `` Office of the President-elect'' was on order to suit either <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> behaved like a man who thought he'd be using the stationery. In his speech at <LOCATION> Notre </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dame </LOCATION>, he said `` much progress has been made'' in superpower relations during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years and added it was important for him and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to `` size each other up correctly.'' He said he would ask his secretary of state to `` make it clear that I am prepared to meet with General Secretary <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at the earliest time that would serve the interests of world peace.'' `` My purpose in such a meeting would not be to achieve any grand breakthrough but to engage in a serious and direct examination of where we are and how we can best go forward toward further arms reductions, a decrease in regional tensions and further adherence to human rights and thus toward a surer peace,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> could n't resist a few sharp digs at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, saying now was no time for `` total inexperience'' in diplomacy and adding that his Democratic rival would name `` doctrinaire liberals'' to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. In a campaign matter that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> jumped on instantly, a top <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> fund-raiser denounced as `` rotten'' a report implying that he was trying to use his position to land a public relations contract for his firm with the government of <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who is not related to the vice president, said he had told his partner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Govan </PERSON> to `` forget it'' when it came to <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, but his partner had ignored the admonition and had written the nation's new president using <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s name <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> referred to the reports as he campaigned his way across the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, saying the country has had a `` bellyful of allowing representatives of foreign governments easy access to the White House.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' first event of the day was in <LOCATION> Youngstown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, a steel-producing region hard hit by recession. He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> likes to talk about labels, a reference to the way the vice president attempts to make him seem a liberal out of touch with the mainstream. `` You know what label I'm intereted in? ` Made in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>' is the label I'm interested in.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday said it would endorse neither <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for president, saying neither candidate `` has established a claim to the office that we find compelling.'' `` This has been a terrible campaign, a national disappointment,'' the newspaper said. With only a week to go, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' schedule seemed stretched almost beyond endurance. He arranged four appearances in as many states _ then was flying to the bedside of his wife <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON>, who was hospitalized with a viral infection in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. His marathon was brightened in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, where he was serenaded with a chorus of `` Happy Birthday'' two days before his 55th and presented with a new snow blower. That was a joking reference to the 25-year-old model that he keeps in his garage in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also took another crack at answering a question that many advisers felt he handled poorly in last month's televised debate, the issue of whether he would favor the death penalty if his wife were raped and murdered. `` I think I would have that kind of emotion,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, the newsman who asked the same question during the debate. `` On the other hand, this is not a country where we glorify vengeance.''

 The state seized more than $ 5 million in businesses and property belonging to a convicted cocaine smuggler Tuesday in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s largest civil racketeering confiscation. The seizures were made as prosecutors filed suit to collect $ 5 million in drug profits the state claims the <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, man funneled into a string of businesses in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and elsewhere. `` This is really a big lick for us,'' said statewide prosecutor <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonacci </PERSON>. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Brothers </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 51, was jailed last week after a <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> jury found him guilty of piloting two planeloads of cocaine from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> in 1986. `` Essentially, this is an action against property in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> derived from a pattern of racketeering,'' said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Zelman </PERSON>, an assistant statewide prosecutor. <PERSON> Zelman </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> sent the cash to a <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> banker named <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellul </PERSON>, who transferred the money back to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to be invested.

<TEXT>
 An ROTC commander recommended Tuesday that a former college student who disappeared with his new wife for four months last spring should serve four years in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> as an enlisted man because he violated his contract. The recommendation that <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON>, 23, serve in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> was made by Brig. Gen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Musselman </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Officers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> regional headquarters in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Knox </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky </LOCATION>. It now goes to Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>, at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monroe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, who will make the final decision, said Capt. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, an ROTC spokesman at <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Knox </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's not punishment, nor is it the final decision,'' <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> said Tuesday night. `` This is all administrative procedure. It was never intended as punishment.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Swansons </ORGANIZATION>' disappearance last April drew national attention as authorities in several states searched for them for four months. They surfaced in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, saying they had vanished to seek `` perfect love.'' <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> said he would abide by the <ORGANIZATION> ROTC </ORGANIZATION> decision and if he must serve in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, `` I'm going to be up front about it ... I'm going to serve proudly.'' <PERSON> Musselman </PERSON>'s recommendation differs from one offered by a three-member Army panel that reviewed <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON>'s case in August. The panel found that <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> had violated his ROTC contract when he and his wife, <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON>, disappeared April 2 before he had completed his military and academic obligations. But it recommended that he be expelled from the ROTC program. The panel also recommended <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> pay back more than $ 16,000 he received through the ROTC program for college tuition and other education expenses. He had been scheduled to graduate from <ORGANIZATION> Wheaton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> last May. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> said the contract is standard procedure for all candidates when they enter the advanced <ORGANIZATION> ROTC </ORGANIZATION> program in their final two years of college. The contract contains a provision stating that any breech of its terms can result in the cadet having to repay an ROTC scholarship, fulfill the contract as an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> officer or serve a term of enlistment, <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> explained. <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> `` knew the options going into it as does every cadet,'' <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> said. He said he did not know how long it would take for <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>, commander general of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> ROTC </ORGANIZATION> command, to make a decision.

 <PERSON> Ensign </PERSON> <PERSON> Deron </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> confidently barked out orders as the helmsman guided a sleek gray <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ship between red and green markers that dotted the smooth waters. Looking toward the bow, he directed the helmsmen to turn the rudder to the right. `` See your red buoy up here?'' asked the helmsman, Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON>. As the ship passed within inches of the red marker, <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> called out another order, then looked over the side and said under his breath, `` We did n't touch, did we?'' <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> had missed the marker, but it would n't have mattered if he had hit it. He and other young officers were the crew on a 36-foot fiberglass model of a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> supply ship gliding across <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bradford </LOCATION> at the Little Creek Amphibious Base. The officers were participating in a popular <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> course on ship handling that uses scale models of everything from a fast frigate to an aircraft carrier. Ship handling is a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> skill that attracts little attention unless something goes awry. The commander of the carrier <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> lost his job because the ship collided with an anchored Spanish collier in <LOCATION> Hampton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Roads </LOCATION> harbor Aug. 29. And the captain of the tank landing ship <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION> was relieved of his command because the ship ran aground during a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> exercise off the coast of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> on Sept. 12. The junior officers who take the one-week ship handling course are a long way from commanding a ship. But with other officers they share responsibility for navigating their ships into piers and anchorages and away from other vessels. The more than 400 officers who take the course each year have been assigned to a ship for at least six months. Most young <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officers get little experience aboard ship, however, because so many officers share the ship-handling duties, said <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON>, who oversees ship-handling training at the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amphibious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. In his 16 years in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> said, he has maneuvered a ship to the dock only twice. `` Here in one week a guy can make 15 pier approaches,'' <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> said as he showed off a 40-by-40-foot water tank where the students practice with remote-controlled ship models. `` Ships have gotten very expensive. You just ca n't afford to let everybody come in and try to take them alongside because if you do have a collision there's going to be a lot of damage,'' he said. The course allows the young officers to make mistakes with few consequences, <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> said. `` Here the captain's not watching,'' he said. `` It's not going to show up on their fitness reports.'' The course begins with the tank, a shallow blue body of water marked with an island, a bridge, a canal and several piers. A small fan provides the wind. With remote-control boxes, the students guide 3-foot models of frigates, destroyers and amphibious assault ships alongside the piers and under the bridge. In the afternoon, they head for the lake to practice in the 43-foot model of a Nimitz-class carrier and five other ships that cost an average of $ 74,000. With a crew of three or four, the ships powered by electric motors glide between the piers, moorings and channel markers set up in the lake. `` It builds confidence,'' <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, 22, of <LOCATION> Saratoga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, said after his turn at navigating. `` You can experiment more.'' Giving orders to the person whose hands are on the wheel teaches responsibility, the students said. `` We learn the basics and when we actually do get to do it, it's a lot more realistic,'' said Lt. j.g <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Kordyjak </PERSON>, 25, of <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> `` We have an idea of the theory behind it.'' <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> said the model ships probably have endured a few fender-benders since they were put in use in the 1970s. Since <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> and other instructors steer the ships, they can simply ignore students' orders if the vessel is about to crash into the dock. But do the students ever get to take a turn at steering? `` Let them have fun? No,'' <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> said with a grin as he turned the wheel of his miniature supply ship.

 The arrival of at least two new Soviet missiles in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> has raised <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concern about <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s security and whether there will be a delay in the second stage of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> The SS-1 Scud rockets were displayed in the Afghan capital after Undersecretary of State <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> complained to Soviet Ambassador <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON> on Monday about sending long-range TU26 Backfire bombers into combat there for the first time. The Soviets are backing the Afghan government against U.S.-armed rebels in a war that has raged for nearly nine years. On Aug. 15, the Soviets completed the pullout of more than half the 100,000 troops that had fought alongside the pro-Moscow government. The remaining troops must depart by Feb. 15 under an agreement signed in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> last spring. The Soviets hinted recently that the second stage would begin Nov. 15. But a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, who spoke Tuesday on condition of anonymity, said that might be delayed. He also said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would see to it that the rebels had an `` adequate'' arsenal, although missiles to match the Scuds probably would not be provided through <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Two Scud-B missiles, which have the range of about 175 miles, were displayed in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, the official said. It was not clear whether the Soviets delivered more of them, which are mobile and can reach the Pakistani frontier as well as vast areas of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` It's clearly intended to intimidate <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>,'' the official said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> weapons to the guerrillas are delivered through <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, which also has given sanctuary to millions of Afghan refugees. The Afghan news agency, in a dispatch Tuesday, accused <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> of instigating attacks by `` extremist'' guerrillas on population centers and demilitarized areas. `` This is why a new kind of weapon, mainly long-range missiles with a great destructive power, was adopted for service by the Afghan army,'' the Afghan general staff said. `` The missiles will be used to stop the criminal activities of the extremist group,'' the dispatch added, without referring specifically to the Scud-B. <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>, the spokesman for the Soviet foreign ministry, said at a news conference last month in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s support for the rebels could have `` unpredictable'' consequences `` We do n't want to be specific,'' he said. But he left open the possibility that the withdrawal of Soviet troops might be suspended. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> cautioned <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Tuesday that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was determined to protect <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. `` If the purpose of these latest military developments is to threaten <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> knows that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> enjoys our full support in this situation,'' he said. The version of the Scud the Soviets are believed to have provided to the Afghan forces is a mobile rocket, 37 feet long, 34 inches in diameter, and weighing 14,000 pounds. The Scud has a simple guidance system, uses liquid fuel, and can be equipped with either a nuclear or high-explosive conventional warhead. `` This action,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said, `` calls into question the Soviets' stated desire to achieve a genuine political settlement in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and their undertakings to us not to engage in offensive actions This display is only the latest attempt by the Soviets to prop up a desperate regime which lacks legitimacy among the Afghan people and clearly demonstrates that the regime is incapable of defending itself.'' In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, accompanying President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on a political speaking tour, issued this formal statement: `` We are concerned about the display of SS-1 missiles in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and the deployment of Soviet MiGs and Backfire bombers. These actions call into question the Soviets' stated desire to achieve a genuine settlement in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` This display of military hardware will only increase tensions in the region. Our support for <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> remains unshakeable.'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> welcomed, meanwhile, the visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of <PERSON> Burhanuddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabbani </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla group. He called Monday in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> for elections to create a new government after Soviet troops withdraw. `` Our position is that we can support any proposal for a political solution which reflects the will of the Afghan people and meets their aspirations for self-determination,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Rabbani </PERSON> will be in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> next week.

<HEAD>Activist, TMI Attorney Face Off Over Contaminated Water</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LANCASTER, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Representatives of the <LOCATION> Three </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> nuclear plant told federal officials Monday that allowing 2.3 million gallons of contaminated water to evaporate would pose no health threat, but an activist argued for storing the water at the site. The statements came before the <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Licensing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which will help decide what to do with the water contaminated by the March 1979 accident at <ORGANIZATION> TMI </ORGANIZATION> Unit 2 and the continuing cleanup. A battery of lawyers representing the plant owner, <ORGANIZATION> GPU </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, faced <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Skolnick </PERSON>, the lone representative of the citizen groups <ORGANIZATION> Three </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alert </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Susquehanna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> B </PERSON>. Block, chairman of the board, repeatedly reproached <PERSON> Skolnick </PERSON>, saying she was failing to prove her alternative was better than the <ORGANIZATION> GPU </ORGANIZATION> proposal. In his opening statement, attorney <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON> told the board <ORGANIZATION> GPU </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> wants to evaporate the water and bury the residue off site as commercial low-level waste at a cost of $ 4.1 million. `` The intervenors' alternative would cost at least $ 2.1 million for the pre-processing of the water, $ 9.1 million for the tanks they suggest, plus the unknown costs of ultimate disposal of the water,'' <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON> also argued evaporation would pose no health risk in the <LOCATION> Middletown </LOCATION> area. He said a conservative estimate of the average exposure to someone living within a 50-mile radius is 0.005 millirems of radiation, compared with about 300 millirems per year that people receive from natural sources. <ORGANIZATION> GPU </ORGANIZATION> Nuclear has argued that storing the water in tanks at the plant would be dangerous because during an accident, the entire load would flow into the nearby <LOCATION> Susquehanna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, which feeds into the <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Piccioni </PERSON>, a senior staff scientist at <ORGANIZATION> Accord </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, disputed the GPU Nuclear scenerio. <PERSON> Piccioni </PERSON>, testifying as <PERSON> Skolnick </PERSON>'s expert witness, said that `` there appears to be an overstatement by the licensee'' regarding the amount of contamination that would be released. Questioned during a break, <PERSON> Piccioni </PERSON> said the levels of contamination suggested by <ORGANIZATION> GPU </ORGANIZATION> Nuclear would not be reached if the activists' recommendations were followed. `` First, they assume that the water is not treated, which they plan on doing anyway,'' he said. `` Second, they assume all 2.3 million gallons would go into the river, and three, they assume people will eat shellfish from the <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> after the release, which would account for a majority of the dose.'' <PERSON> Piccioni </PERSON> acknowledged the alternative would cost more than <ORGANIZATION> GPU </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION>'s plan. `` But I do n't have an easy time associating dollar costs with cancer risks,'' he said. The four-day hearing continues Tuesday.

<HEAD>Shuttle Atlantis Set For Move To Launch Pad</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Space shuttle Atlantis will be moved to the launch pad early Wednesday for a late November liftoff with a secret military payload. The four-mile, six-hour trip to Launch Pad 39B was scheduled to start at 12:01 a.m., with the shuttle perched upright on the broad back of a giant tracked transporter called a crawler. The move was delayed two days after a three-inch wire was discovered Saturday pinned beneath a nut and washer that are part of structure that attaches the shuttle to its external fuel tank. Before the nut could be loosened to get at the wire, <ORGANIZATION> Atlantis </ORGANIZATION> had to be partially decoupled from the tank, to which it was attached last week. <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Malone </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adminstration </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, said the wire was removed Monday and engineers did not determine how it became lodged under the washer. At the pad, <ORGANIZATION> Atlantis </ORGANIZATION> will be readied for a launch in the last week in November. A date will be set Nov. 10 following a flight readiness review. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said Monday the launch would occur between 6:32 a.m. and 9:32 a.m. EST. Much of the flight will be cloaked in secrecy because of the classified payload, believed to be an intelligence-gathering satellite. A five-man crew of military officers will fly the mission.

<HEAD>Landfill Ruled Out At Sacred Indian Burial Ground and Recreation

 The state environmental agency has blocked a nine-year attempt by an excavating company to establish a landfill on land believed to be a sacred Indian burial ground. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shank </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, went to the <ORGANIZATION> Cuyahoga </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recreation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> between <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION> on Monday to announce his rejection of the landfill application. `` We won! The council fires will be burning tonight all over the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON>, a social worker at <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, who has worked to preserve the remaining 25 percent of the burial ground undisturbed by shale mining The council fires, similar to the `` smoke signals'' that Indians used to communicate, `` mean we have succeeded to keep from polluting the burial grounds,'' <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Shank </PERSON> said his decision, while affecting the burial site and the 33,000-acre recreation area, was based primarily on environmental risks to underground water resources. He said the geology of the landfill site, a 200-foot shale quarry in this <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> suburb, was inappropriate for dumping trash because of the risk of contamination of underground water resources. The company wanted permission to dump up to 2,750 tons a day. In addition, <PERSON> Shank </PERSON> said, `` This decision is based, in part, on my continued belief that a landfill has no business being placed in or near a park or recognized recreation area such as this one in the <LOCATION> Cuyahoga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>.'' The recreation area, which follows a 22-mile stretch along the <LOCATION> Cuyahoga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, attracts more than 6 million people a year. <ORGANIZATION> Boyas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Excavating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> had applied to operate a 31-acre landfill on private land within the park boundary for up to 20 years. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Gavin </PERSON>, an attorney for Boyas Excavating, said the company would probably appeal <ORGANIZATION> Shank </ORGANIZATION>'s decision because of the expense incurred in its nine-year battle to gain approval of the landfill. <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON>, 60, a member of the Choctaw Indian tribe of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, has visited the burial ground once or twice weekly for several years. He hopes to rebury bones found at the site in 1984 if Indians gain control of the land.

<HEAD>Stabilizing Interest Rates Forecast</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Interest rates have been falling in recent weeks, but many economists believe they will stabilize around current levels for the rest of the year and climb early next year. While the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> is not likely to take any action to drive rates higher for the rest of 1988, these analysts said the central bank will be forced into a series of rate hikes beginning next year to fight renewed inflationary pressures. The Federal Open Market Committee, led by <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, was meeting behind closed doors today to review how the economy has been performing and map monetary policy for the next two months. Analysts said they expected no dramatic change in course from this session, especially given the fact that the presidential election is just one week away. `` Right now there is no overwhelming need to change monetary policy and they certainly are n't going to stick their neck out one week before an election,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, chief financial economist with <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, forecasting firm. Various economic reports are suggesting that the economy slowed in the second half of the year. Last week, the government said the broadest measure of the economy, the gross national product, grew at a modest 2.2 percent annual rate during the summer, the slowest pace in almost two years. Many economists believe this slowdown is good because it will relieve the pressure on tight labor markets and factories already operating at peak capacity. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> began a series of credit-tightening steps late last March which culminated in August with a one-half percentage point increase in its discount rate, the interest it charges to make bank loans. Analysts give these changes part of the credit for slowing economic growth although some critics contend the central bank overreacted and has increased the chances of a recession next year. `` Economic growth has slowed to far below its potential,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahn </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is time for the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to reverse its mistaken interest-rate policy and lower the discount rate before slowing investment derails the 71-month-old economic expansion.'' While economic growth has slowed, many economists argue that it is not at all certain that inflationary pressures have abated. They predicted the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> would take a wait-and-see attitude, ready to react more quickly to signs of inflation than to fears of a recession. The performance of consumer prices, especially energy and food prices, and renewed downward pressure on the dollar will contribute to higher inflation next year, many economists said. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, head of a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> forecasting firm, said the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> will probably delay further increases in interest rates, however, partly out of fears that it could be accused of manipulating the presidential election. `` I think the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> would consider it extremely poor form to tighten right after the election. People would say they knew they had to tighten but they just held off until -LRB- <PERSON> George </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> got elected,'' he said. Mortgage rates have been falling in recent weeks, reflecting an easing of inflation fears on financial markets because of the various reports showing slower growth in the second half. Fixed-rate mortgages stood at 10.22 percent at the end of last week, according to a survey by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, down from 10.42 percent at the end of September. Reflecting this decline, the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> announced Monday that it was lowering its maximum interest rate for federally backed <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> home loan mortgages by one-half percentage point to 10 percent, effective Tuesday. But <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Lasko </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said he would not be surprised to see fixed-rate mortgages hit 11 percent by next spring, driven higher by borrowing demands on the part of the federal government and other factors. `` The economy is working at almost full capacity, there are some pressures on wages,'' he said. `` While these pressures are less ominous than they were two months ago, we are still forecasting higher interest rates.'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> predicted that fixed-rate mortgages could hit 11.5 percent next year. The official minutes of today's meeting will not be released until after the next <ORGANIZATION> FOMC </ORGANIZATION> meeting, scheduled for Dec. 13-14. On Friday, the central bank will release the minutes of the last policy session, held on Sept. 20.

<HEAD>Survey Says LA, Washington, Boston Are Best Real Estate Markets</HEAD>

 A new survey of real estate investment prospects in major cities says there are fewer `` best'' markets this year, although <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> remain the most favorable. It said the worst real estate markets are <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. The report released Monday said <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> was dropped from the list of `` most bullish'' property markets because it is `` just too expensive'' to live there. Even <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, while remaining on the list of top prospects, were said to face possible future problems due to their fast-rising housing costs. `` Fewer and fewer people can afford to live in or near those centers, and that will take its toll on economic expansion,'' the report said. But <ORGANIZATION> Real </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said that despite its current problems, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is `` a premier market that will return to favor as its inherent strengths prevail.'' The company said its survey was based on interviews with 90 real estate investors, lenders and developers around the country. It said there are fewer `` best'' markets than in the past and that `` no city or region offers good prospects across the board.'' <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> was called a prime investment prospect despite regulatory barriers. `` LA's pluses _ economic diversity, job growth, climate, quality of life, and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rim </LOCATION> access _ outweigh traffic congestion, smog, ridiculously high housing prices, and regulatory hurdles,'' said the report, `` Emerging Trends in Real Estate, 1989.'' Growth restriction, it says, `` is one of the things that attracts investors to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and to the other top-ranked areas. Developers complain, often bitterly, of the hassles, expense and risk, but they are increasingly resigned to them and willing to accept the responsibilities in return for unsurpass development opportunities, less competition, and upside profits.'' The report put <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> under `` places to be avoided.'' Also included in this category were <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>. `` Any meaningful turnaround is still a year or so off in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and two to three years in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>,'' the report said. `` <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, a much smaller market, needs a year-or-two respite. When it does come back, it wo n't be to the level of the early'80s.'' Here is what the report said of other cities as real estate investment opportunities: <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>: `` Overbuilt in every property type. Speculative S & amp; L-financed land deals, apartments and office space are in seriously long supply. The <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> economy is slow and steady -LRB- resort pizazz notwithstanding -RRB- and needs three years to rebuild enough momentum to justify new starts.'' <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>: `` share the distinction of receiving about as many positive votes as negatives.''

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> disputes hostage <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s videotaped statement that the administration bargained with terrorists, but says he still does n't know what happened in the Iran-Contra affair. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> commented Monday on the videotape of <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> that was released in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem kidnappers. `` I do n't think that was <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> speaking,'' the president said after a bill-signing ceremony in a hotel ballroom. `` I think he had a script that was given to him.'' `` When I was given a script, I always read the lines,'' the former movie actor said to laughter in the room sprinkled with film luminaries. Hollywood executives and such stars as <PERSON> Charlton </PERSON> <PERSON> Heston </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Cyd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Charisse </ORGANIZATION> had come to watch <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> sign a copyright bill affecting the entertainment industry. Reporters, however, zeroed in on <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s taped statements that the administration thwarted efforts for the release of the hostages and that Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had bargained with terrorists during the Iran-Contra affair and the 1985 hijacking of a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> airliner on a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> flight. `` There's never been any interference, nor have we ever been negotiating any more than we would with any other kind of kidnapper on a ransom type of basis,'' the president said. Asked specifically whether <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, now the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate for president, was involved in the <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> talks, the president said, `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> has been a part of everything that we've accomplished ... but in a constructive way, and that's why he's my choice in the coming election.'' When asked if this meant <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was involved in all his decisions on the Iran-Contra affair `` which wound up in a scandal,'' the president replied: `` Well, there was no scandal. That scandal ... I'm afraid has been artificially created by a media that I can not understand ...'' The president completed the sentence by saying that his administration sought to find out the facts `` the minute the news broke and the operation was exposed.'' `` And I am still asking, after 10 months of a congressional investigation _ I still do n't know who delivered the weapons and where the money came from,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, asked during an interview with <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> anchor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON> about <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s statement, said: `` I had no role that you are aware of or are not aware of, absolutely. So I do n't know what he's, what that refers to.'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 41, the chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, was kidnapped by the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jihad </LOCATION> on March 16, 1985. He is the longest-held of the 14 foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Nine are Americans. Copies of the 2-minute, 35-second tape were delivered to two Western news agencies in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> four days after <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> marked his fourth birthday in captivity. `` I have been very close to being released several times over the past three years, but each time it seems that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government uses its influence to stop any agreement and I do n't understand this,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said on the tape `` I am not asking <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to deal with terrorists, although Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did so in the Iran-Contra affair and <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> hijacking,'' he said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said `` any information'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> has must come from his captors. `` You have to recognize that no hostage is taking something upon himself,'' he said. `` They're telling him what to do.''

<HEAD>New Book, TV Special Reignite Debate Over JFK Assassination</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A new book and a TV report are reviving the emotional debate over the <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> assassination and whether reputed <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> mob chieftain <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcello </PERSON> conspired to kill the president. <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kwitny </PERSON>, a former investigative reporter for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, hosts an hour-long public television special that concludes there was a mob conspiracy to kill <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. The TV report points to evidence that both <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> assassin <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> and <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON>'s killer, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON>, had connections to <PERSON> Marcello </PERSON>'s crime syndicate. The show airs tonight on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> public television and elsewhere later in the month. It recounts a potpourri of evidence presented over the years by <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> authors, theorists and investigators, plus some new evidence unearthed by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, a cousin of <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> and author of a new book on Marcello and the JFK slaying. <PERSON> Marcello </PERSON>, who was a prime target of then-Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and was temporarily deported by <LOCATION> RFK </LOCATION>, was mentioned by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assassinations </ORGANIZATION> as a possible conspiracy suspect in the <LOCATION> JFK </LOCATION> assassination. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel concluded that <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was probably the victim of a conspiracy, breaking sharply with the <ORGANIZATION> Warren </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The commission, appointed by <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and headed by then-Chief Justice <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, concluded that there was no conspiracy, and two commission counsels who appear on The Kwitny Report reject the mob conspiracy theory as nonsense. Sen. <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>, R-Pa., who served as a commission counsel, said evidence presented by the theorists are `` snatches of a little fact here and there which really add up to nothing. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Warren </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> turned over every stone and found no conspiracy,'' <PERSON> Specter </PERSON> said. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Belin </PERSON>, the panel's chief counsel, scoffed at the notion that <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON>, who gunned down <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> in a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> police station, was a mob assassin. `` Mafia hitmen do not go ahead and kill their targets when they're surrounded by police, when they're sure to be apprehended and face life in prison and possible death,'' he said. <PERSON> Marcello </PERSON> reportedly hated the <PERSON> Kennedys </PERSON> for the 1961 deportation. A Las Vegas private investigator told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee that <PERSON> Marcello </PERSON> indicated to him a year before the slaying that he wanted to kill the president. `` You cut off the head, the tail dies,'' <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Marcello </PERSON> as saying. The tail allegedly was a reference to <LOCATION> RFK </LOCATION>. The evidence presented by mob conspiracy theorists include that <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON>'s uncle, who helped raise him, worked for the <PERSON> Marcello </PERSON> organization, and reports that <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> at least several times met <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrie </PERSON>, who was <PERSON> Marcello </PERSON>'s personal pilot. A new piece of evidence uncovered by <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> in his book, titled `` Mafia Kingfish,'' is an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report quoting a <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> businessman who said shortly after the assassination that he remembered seeing <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> earlier that year accepting cash from a man later identified as a top Marcello lieutenant. The author said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> never followed up on that lead. Ruby, according to one <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report, was not just a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> nightclub owner and a small-time operator but an important player in narcotics trafficking in the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> area, which would have fallen under <PERSON> Marcello </PERSON>'s turf. And the mob conspiracy theorists point to reports that <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON> went to visit <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> <PERSON> Traficante </PERSON> when the reputed <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> mob boss was imprisoned in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. `` Clearly, <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON>'s ties to the Mafia were n't just marginal as the <ORGANIZATION> Warren </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> suggested. He was exactly the sort of person to be assigned to an important and risky mission. And he was not the sort of person who would have suddenly shot <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> in sorrow for the <PERSON> Kennedys </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Kwitny </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kwitny </PERSON> points to several eyewitness reports that place Ruby outside the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> police station long before he shot <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON> said he just happened on the police station and killed <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> spontaneously, hoping to spare the president's widow the pain of coming back to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and testifying at <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON>'s trial. <PERSON> Belin </PERSON> dismissed the reports of those who say they saw Ruby earlier. `` Whenever you have a witness to an accident, to any sudden emergency, you're going to get different stories,'' he said. <PERSON> Kwitny </PERSON> also argues that the late Teamsters boss <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffa </PERSON> was involved with <PERSON> Marcello </PERSON> in the alleged conspiracy, noting <PERSON> Hoffa </PERSON>'s hatred of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> for his dogged investigations of union corruption <PERSON> Kwitny </PERSON> also quoted <PERSON> Hoffa </PERSON>'s son as saying his father had known <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON> since 1939, and law enforcement officials said <PERSON> Hoffa </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marcello </PERSON> were close. The Kennedy assassination, 25 years ago this Nov. 22, has triggered a never-ending flow of conspiracy theories, ranging from mob retribution to a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> scheme to a plot by <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>. Last week, a British television program claimed three French gangsters killed <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> on a contract from American mob figures. Some, including the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> assassinations committee, believe there was a second gunman standing on the grassy knoll as the president's motorcade rode through <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>' <LOCATION> Dealey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plaza </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has stood by the <ORGANIZATION> Warren </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> findings and closed its investigation into the slaying.

<HEAD>Commodity Prices Stabilize</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 New figures from the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> show that farm commodity prices, on the average, have held steady the last two months after peaking during the summer drought. Even so, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s preliminary figures released Monday showed that October prices still averaged 13 percent more than they did a year ago. The department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said prices rose from September to October for oranges, milk, lettuce and corn but were offset by lower prices for tomatoes, apples, eggs and soybeans. Meanwhile, prices paid by farmers to meet expenses _ a figure computed only every three months _ rose 1.2 percent from July and averaged 5.5 percent more than a year ago. Farmers paid more for feeder cattle and calves than they did in July, but feed and fuels were lower, the report said. Prices received by farmers for some major commodities are based on mid-month averages and then are revised the following month when additional information is available. The revised figures showed the leveling off actually began in September when the price index held steady at its August average. The preliminary reading for October continued at the August-September level. Prices of raw farm commodities began rising in May as the drought worsened and continued climbing in June, July and August, an increase of about 11 percent from last April. After holding steady during most of last winter, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> index rose 3.1 percent from April to May, followed by June, 2.2 percent; July 2.9 percent; and August 2.1 percent. The drought and searing heat during the spring and summer cut 1988 harvest prospects sharply and triggered the midyear price rise. Total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain production is expected to be down 31 percent from last year's harvest. Despite the leveling of the overall price index, some commodity prices were higher in October. Wheat, for example, rose an additional 14 cents per bushel to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm price average of $ 3.89 per bushel, the most since it was $ 3.95 in May 1981. Prices of livestock and livestock products as a group were unchanged from September, although dairy products gained 3.1 percent during the month and the index for poultry and eggs declined 5 percent. Compared with October 1987, the index was up 4.1 percent. The department's all-crops price index for October, although unchanged from September, was up 27 percent from a year earlier. Prices of feed grain and hay as a group rose 1.5 percent from September and averaged 62 percent more than in October 1987. Prices of commercial vegetables were down 5 percent from September but were still 8.2 percent more than a year ago. Although the projections are subject to change, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> economists say that net cash income of farmers may be in the range of $ 55 billion to $ 60 billion this year, compared with the record level of $ 57.1 billion in 1987. That is the difference between cash receipts and cash expenses during the calendar year. Department economists are holding to an earlier prediction that consumer food prices will rise 3 percent to 5 percent this year, compared with a 4.2 percent average increase in 1987. Before the drought took hold, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> was predicting a 1988 food price hike of 2 percent to 4 percent. Some <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> officials also have predicted that the drought may add 2 percentage points to food prices in 1989, above the expected increase in inflation, currently forecast at around 4 percent. That could mean a 1989 food prices increase in the range of 6 percent to 7 percent. The report said: _ Cattle averaged $ 67.90 per 100 pounds of live weight nationally, up from $ 67.20 in September and $ 62.90 reported for October 1987 Those are averages for all types of cattle sold as beef. _ Hogs averaged $ 39.40 per 100 pounds, compared with $ 40.70 in September and $ 48.90 a year earlier _ Corn, at $ 2.71 a bushel, was up from $ 2.60 in September and the average of $ 1.55 per bushel a year earlier _ Wheat prices at the farm, according to preliminary figures, averaged $ 3.89 per bushel, compared with $ 3.75 in September and $ 2.62 a year earlier _ Rice averaged $ 7.15 per 100 pounds, compared with $ 6.82 in September and $ 5.88 a year earlier _ Soybeans were $ 7.71 per bushel, compared with $ 7.94 in September and $ 5.04 a year earlier _ Upland cotton was reported at 50 cents per pound, compared with 51.8 in September and 65.1 cents in October 1987 _ Eggs were 58.7 cents per dozen, compared with 63.8 cents in September and 50.2 cents a year earlier _ Milk was $ 12.80 per 100 pounds, compared with $ 12.40 in September and $ 12.90 a year earlier _ Broilers were 37.5 cents per pound, live weight, compared with 39.2 cents in September and 25.1 cents a year ago

<HEAD>Documents Suggest Pilot Waited Too Long To Apply Full Power</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The pilot of a <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> flight that crashed last August near <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> waited at least 20 seconds after a stall warning before he applied full power, according to documents. The documents made public Monday by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> pointed to no specific cause for the Aug. 31 crash in which 14 of the 108 people aboard Flight 1141 were killed. The <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> investigation is not expected to be completed for a number of weeks. According to a transcript of the cockpit voice recorder tape on Flight 1141, an unusual `` snap'' was heard seconds after liftoff, followed almost immediately by a vibration of the control column _ a warning of an impending stall. A normal procedure for dealing with an impending stall close to the ground such as in a takeoff would be to apply full power and attempt to fly out of the problem, according to aviation experts. But the transcript showed that Capt. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, 48, a veteran <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> pilot, did not call for `` full power'' until nearly 23 seconds after the first sign of trouble and nearly 20 seconds after the so-called `` stickshaker'' stall warning. The call to full power came as the aircraft was about to crash and eight seconds after <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> could be heard on the tape saying, `` We're not gon na make it,'' according to the transcript. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, a 23-year veteran at <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> with 17,000 hours of flying including 6,500 in a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727, later told investigators, `` In retrospect, I should have pushed up full power immediately.'' A summary of the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> interview of <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> from his hospital bed was included among the documents made public Monday without further comment by safety board officials. The documents provided no apparent clear evidence as to specifically what caused Flight 1141 not to gain proper lift as it departed the <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> airport. The flight was bound for <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. The investigation continues to focus on the possibility that the flight crew failed to set the plane's flaps properly, inhibiting the aircraft's lift. The <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> previously had said that the wing flaps were found in a retracted position in the wreckage as was the cockpit lever controlling the flaps. But the cockpit tape transcript shows, as also has been previously disclosed, that co-pilot <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> specifically acknowledged during a pre-takeoff check that the flaps were in the proper 15 degree extension _ contradicting evidence in the wreckage. But that does not necessarily mean the flaps actually were in that position, sources close to the investigation have said. Among the documents released Monday were the results of a sophisticated sound analysis of the tape to determine whether there were any background sounds to indicate flaps being extended. The tests concluded that after an examination of the entire tape from Flight 1141 no noise pattern could be found to match the pattern of flaps actually being set on a test <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 aircraft. Two `` click'' sounds heard on the tape did not match the pattern of an actual setting of flaps on the test plane, the document said. <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> has told investigators he recalls nothing after the plane departed from the gate. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> has said he does not know whether the flaps were set properly, although he recalled <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> making the acknowledgment. A third man in the cockpit, flight engineer <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Judd </PERSON>, 31, said he believes that <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> set the flaps to their proper setting, but does not recall actually seeing the flap lever in that position. According to the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> documents, a takeoff alarm that should have sounded if the flaps were not properly set, was inspected 20 days before the accident and replaced because the horn was `` weak and intermittent.'' A new alarm was installed. Meanwhile, the cockpit tape, which began shortly before the aircraft pushed back from the gate, revealed that Flight 1141 had nearly a 30-minute wait before getting takeoff clearance, during which much of the time the flight crew _ sometimes with a flight attendant taking part _ engaged in casual conversation, including a lengthy exchange about the large number of birds at the <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> airport. At one point, the transcript refers to nearly eight minutes of `` nonpertinent conversation'' _ omitted from the transcript _ with a senior flight attendant. The exchange is cut short when <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> asks <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> about requiring to change frequencies to contact a second ground controller as the plane moved from the east to the west side of the airport. `` Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm sitting here talking to the flight attendant,'' apologized <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>. <PERSON> Judd </PERSON>, the flight engineer, later told investigators that when the plane was third in line for takeoff, he announced the plane would be taking off soon `` in part because of his concern about the flight attendant's continued presence in the cockpit,'' one <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> document said.

<HEAD>JFK's Legacy Echoing on the Campaign Trail in the Closing Days</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In Republican as well as Democratic accents, the name and the policies of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> are echoing in the waning days of the campaign for the White House. And to hear the Republican ticket tell it, Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is no <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> claims that on such issues as taxes and defense, he has more in common with JFK than <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> does. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been invoking the <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> political legacy all campaign long. On Sunday, after shrinking from the liberal label all season, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> declared that he is one, and said <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was, too. `` Yes, I am a liberal in the tradition of <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Roosevelt </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>,'' the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said. That's not the Kennedy legacy <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> cites. `` How much the national <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has changed since the days of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` How far it has moved from those policies of lower taxes and a stronger defense.'' A <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign commercial recalls the narrow 1960 victory that put <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> in the White House. `` My friends, they won that election by a margin of 112,000 votes out of nearly 70 million cast,'' he says. `` And remember what a difference <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> made in the lives of millions and millions of people.'' The Kennedy issue first was unleashed by Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee and unlikely enforcer of claims on the JFK legacy. In debate with Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> dismissed his rival's claim to congressional experience matching <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s with a stinging: `` Senator, you're no <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s brother, Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, was gentler and kinder to <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said that while they disagree on issues, he thinks the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator was treated unfairly in news accounts that questioned his record and abilities. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> used <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s belittling line Monday to dispute <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' claim to the venerable liberal tradition of <LOCATION> Roosevelt </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> `` I did n't know <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and I did n't serve with <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, but <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is no <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told a crowd in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. When he chose <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> as his running mate, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he was reassembling a <ORGANIZATION> Boston-Austin </ORGANIZATION> partnership that would win the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> as <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> did in 1960. He says that was `` a strong ticket, one of our best tickets,'' and that he and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> are out to match it. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has taken to reciting lines from <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> speeches, notably on a 1963 tax cut proposal. In <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, last Thursday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' election would mean higher taxes, smothering economic growth, and that it would then become virtually impossible to cut the budget deficit `` The reason for this was perhaps best explained by a previous Democratic president, none other than <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, back in 1962. ` It is a paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high today and tax revenues are too low, and the soundest way to raise the revenues in the long run is to cut the rates now,''' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said quoting the late president. In <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, insisting that his proposal for a reduction in the tax on capital gains would spur the economy and create new jobs, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> endorsed just such a plan. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has denounced the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposal as a tax break for the rich. In <LOCATION> Waterbury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> recalled a memorable <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> campaign rally shortly before his 1960 victory, when thousands of people waited long into a rainy night to see the young candidate from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` If we succeed here, then the cause of freedom is strengthened,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> told them. `` It's important to remember how President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> went about strengthening the cause of freedom,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` He signed one of the most important tax cuts in our history. He rapidly rebuilt <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s national defense. And from that position of strength he was able to negotiate a test ban treaty with the Soviets.'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> did not live to sign the tax cut he proposed. President <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> signed it into law on Feb. 26, 1964. There's sometimes a Kennedy flavor in <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' campaign speeches, more often in the six weeks or so since <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorensen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s friend, aide and speechwriter, began traveling with the Democratic nominee. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> tells people that `` we can do better,'' promises to `` get this country moving again,'' sometimes speaks of conquering new frontiers.

<HEAD>Supreme Court to Rule in Secrecy Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> will referee a dispute over congressional access to national security information, the latest conflict over checks and balances between the legislative and executive branches. The justices announced Monday they will consider reviving legislation limiting presidential authority to withhold classified information. A decision is expected by July. Justice <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, who had breast cancer surgery 10 days ago at <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, was back on the bench as she and her fellow justices returned from a two-week recess to hear arguments and issue orders. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, 58, has said the cancer was detected in an early stage and the prognosis is for a full recovery. The national security case involving classified information, a sticking point for years between <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and various presidents, stems from a 1983 directive by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The directive requires federal officials, before they are allowed access to classified information, to sign an agreement they will not disclose the information. The directive also created a standard form for officials to sign, promising they never will divulge classified or `` classifiable'' information without written permission from proper authorities. Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> said the president is seeking to abridge free-speech rights of federal employees and `` punish whistleblowers for making disclosures that embarrass their superiors.'' Opponents of the presidential directive also said the secrecy agreement federal employees must sign would bar them for life from revealing information to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> which lawmakers are entitled to receive. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> enacted legislation prohibiting use of funds during the 1987-88 fiscal year to implement the standard forms <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had authorized. A similar provision was attached to the spending bill for the current fiscal year. A federal judge declared the legislation unconstitutional last May because he said it tramples on presidential foreign-policy powers. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, representing members of the nation's diplomatic corps, and senators and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members from both political parties appealed to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to reinstate the law. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> announced last week that he was pocket-vetoing another measure intended to give new protection to federal employees who expose government fraud and abuse.

<HEAD>Experts Say Soviet Budget Gap Is Relatively Bigger Than US Deficit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> experts say the Soviet budget deficit that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has finally acknowledged is comparatively larger than that of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and could jeopardize the reform program of Kremlin chief <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The Soviets likely will try to ease the deficit by printing more money, raising prices and reducing subsidies on such goods as housing and food, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and two non-government economists, <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanous </PERSON>. But those steps could anger consumers as well as key interest groups such as the military, <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Vanous </PERSON> said Monday in telephone interviews. The Soviet finance minister, <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Gostev </PERSON>, said during a session of parliament last week that the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> expected to run a deficit of 34 billion rubles -LRB- $ 55 billion -RRB- on a budget of 493 billion rubles -LRB- $ 795 billion -RRB- in 1989. The Soviet government budget makes up the bulk of the socialist country's economy, in which nearly all enterprises are owned by the state. <PERSON> Gostev </PERSON> did not disclose the deficit for 1988 or previous years. A <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> report issued in September before <PERSON> Gostev </PERSON> spoke estimated that the Soviet deficit had grown from 11 billion rubles or 1.4 percent of gross national product in 1984 to 64 billion rubles or 7.4 percent of GNP in 1987. By contrast, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government deficit peaked as a percentage of GNP at 3.5 percent in 1986 _ $ 148 billion. Vanous estimated the Soviet deficit for 1987 and 1988 at 65-75 billion rubles per year. `` The actual deficit is much higher'' than the Soviet figure, said <PERSON> Vanous </PERSON>, who develops econometric models of the Soviet economy for <ORGANIZATION> PlanEcon </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> firm. `` What they have released to the public is a distortion.'' The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> analysis said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> `` needs to come to grips with the budget deficit. Most of the options open to him, however, impinge on the welfare of the population or key interest groups, such as the military, just at a time when he needs as much political support as he can garner.'' `` If the budget deficit is not brought down, it could lead to inflation much worse than the Soviets have experience in the postwar era,'' the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Gostev </PERSON>'s budget figures were `` probably meant as a warning signal to the population ... that prices will be going up and that subsidies will be going down.'' `` The whole thing is so bizarre, because they say now that the previous budgets were incorrect,'' said <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, the associate director of the <ORGANIZATION> Russian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>. `` Glasnost -LRB- greater openness -RRB- has been in effect for three years, and this is the first we have heard of the deficit. So we do n't know what is right.'' The deficit began to rise in 1985, the year <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> became <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> general secretary, and `` it really took off in 1987-88,'' said <PERSON> Vanous </PERSON>. Vanous attributed the jump to two factors: a 30 billion ruble revenue shortfall resulting from decreased sales of state-produced alcohol and a 40 billion decrease in oil export and related earnings due to lower world petroleum prices. While two main sources of revenue were drying up, said <PERSON> Vanous </PERSON>, outlays increased. `` <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> went ahead and kept spending,'' he said. `` They have already been running deficits, but they were typically quite modest, 2-3 percent of GNP, which was covered by increase in monetary supply, causing inflation,'' said <PERSON> Vanous </PERSON>. `` They always have hidden inflation, which was running at 2-3 percent per year. They are finally admitting it because it is so bad in some sectors,'' he said. Soviet economists, and <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, have said that the budget was also caused by new methods of accounting introduced under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to give a more accurate picture of the economy. The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> analysis said <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> economic figures are so far off that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence agency had developed its own method of calculating the Soviet ecomomy. Recent statements by Soviet reformers indicated that <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> estimates were in many cases closer to the truth than the previous official Soviet data, the analysis said.

 The chairman of the fund insuring commercial bank deposits says he's ready to help the comparable fund for savings institutions _ provided there's no request for money involved. `` The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> would like to help you in any way we can _ within limits, of course,'' <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> told delegates to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION>' 96th annual convention In remarks to reporters after his speech on Monday, <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said, `` I strongly oppose the banks having to pay for the problems of the thrift industry'' and that banks prefer `` to go it alone'' with their own insurance fund. However, he did not rule out merging the two regulatory systems, provided insurance costs were kept separate. He said the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> could help thrifts by providing use of its credit. At midyear, 497 of the 3,096 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> savings associations were insolvent, while another 408 were losing money. Regulators estimate it will cost $ 45 billion to $ 50 billion to clean up the mess, and the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls say they ca n't pay for the cleanup without help from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. In contrast, <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> fund, although it will suffer its first loss ever, is sound. It had $ 16.3 billion at the end of September and should shrink to between $ 15 billion and $ 16 billion by years's end, before growing by about $ 500 million next year, he said. <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said bank failures should decline from a post-Depression record topping 200 this year to between 175 and 200 next year. There are no more `` megabank failures on the horizon'' next year, he said. <PERSON> Theo </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitt </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Pioneer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, and outgoing chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L industry's trade group, said the organization will fight next year to preserve a separate regulatory system, arguing that it is crucial to the American home buyer. <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said Americans appear to want a separate S & amp; L system and government probably will preserve one, but, he said, `` I do n't think the world would necessarily come to an end if there were no thrifts. <PERSON> Pitt </PERSON>, opening the first day of a four-day convention, said bungled deregulation by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration bankrupted the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` We've had our troubles, but you know how we got there: as a result of ill-timed, poorly executed, ill-conceived deregulation,'' <PERSON> Pitt </PERSON> said. `` The regulators let some real sharpies slip into the system, high fliers who looked upon their institutions as personal piggy banks to serve their own irresponsible, sometimes criminal ends,'' he said. <PERSON> Pitt </PERSON> said the industry has spent $ 4.5 billion in extra payments to its insurance fund, can spend no more than an additional $ 3 billion, and should not be forced to contribute more because the crisis was not of its making. However, <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Selby </PERSON>, former director of regulatory affairs in the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees some of the most troubled savings institutions in the country, disputed <PERSON> Pitt </PERSON>'s account `` My God, the thrift industry has fought and fought and fought regulation,'' <PERSON> Selby </PERSON> said in an interview. `` They want to have their cake and eat it both.'' <PERSON> Selby </PERSON>, who now operates a consulting firm in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insignia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` They wanted deregulation. They got deregulation. They did n't want supervised deregulation, and they did n't get supervised deregulation.'' <PERSON> Pitt </PERSON>, outlining a part of the trade group's legislative strategy for next year, said the industry will push for regulatory reform as part of a package providing new money to the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION>. Among the reforms he mentioned were: tighter restrictions on S & amp; L investments in junk bonds and in commercial real estate projects, limits on the availability of high-priced brokered deposits, greater power for regulators to block the creation of new S & amp; Ls or the transfer of ownership of existing institutions, and limits on growth tied to the amount of capital an institution can raise from private investors.

 <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> pleaded innocent Monday to racketeering charges for allegedly helping her husband, deposed <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, plunder $ 100 million from their country's treasury. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> set bail for Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> at $ 5 million and said she could not return to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and her ailing husband until details of the bond are worked out. Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, 59, famous for her opulent lifestyle as first lady of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, arrived at the federal courthouse by limousine accompanied by an entourage of at least a dozen people. She wore a full-length, chiffon aquamarine gown with traditional Filipino butterfly sleeves, pearl earrings and black pumps, and her queenly appearance stunned the crowded courtroom into silence. Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> later found herself blinking back tears when the judge refused to allow her to return right away to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, where she and her 71-year-old husband have lived since he was forced out of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> in February 1986. `` I'm not going to let the lady go back to the <LOCATION> Hawaiian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> until I'm certain the bail is set,'' <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> said as a glum Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> brushed away a tear. He ordered her to return to court Thursday with her lawyers if they had not worked out a bail package by then with prosecutors. After being fingerprinted and photographed by federal marshals, she was released temporarily without bail and told not to leave the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> area. Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, who arrived Sunday, is staying at the posh <ORGANIZATION> Waldorf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Towers </ORGANIZATION> in a suite reportedly costing $ 1,800 a night. Aides said the bill would be paid by <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> friends they would not identify. The Marcoses were indicted Oct. 21 by a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> for a racketeering scheme that allegedly plundered the Filipino treasury of some $ 103 million. The money allegedly was spirited out of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> to foreign bank accounts and then used to buy prime <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> real estate and art objects. The court appearance was Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' first visit to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> since she and her husband fled their homeland. They have lived in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> since then and are forbidden to leave the island of <LOCATION> Oahu </LOCATION> without <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government permission. The former president remained in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> lawyers claimed last week that he was too frail to make the 10-hour plane trip. <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> postponed <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' arraignment pending an examination by a government physician, performed later Monday in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. Results were to be sent Tuesday to the judge and lawyers in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said Sgt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Shipp </PERSON>, a spokesman at <ORGANIZATION> Tripler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> sat with two lawyers on either side of her and spoke aloud only twice during the 45-minute proceeding: once to waive a reading of the six-count indictment, and once to answer, `` Not guilty.'' Outside the courthouse, at least a dozen sign-carrying protesters chanted `` Justice, justice must prevail. Send the Marcoses to jail!'' One woman, wearing a black cape and vampire fangs held up a sign that read: `` <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, bloodsucker of the Filipino people.'' But their demonstration was off to the side of an even bigger crowd that included hundreds of photographers, television camera crews and passers-by who stopped out of curiosity about the commotion. Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, coatless despite the chill autumn air, clasped rosary beads as she stepped from a caravan of seven autos and walked the gauntlet of reporters and photographers, who were held back by police barricades on the courthouse steps. In the courtroom, crowded with 200 artists, reporters and spectators, the bulk of the session was taken up with trying to set bail. After lawyers for both sides argued, <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> set bail to be secured by real estate, cash and personal possessions `` amounting to a reasonable market value of $ 5 million.'' Earlier in the hearing, the judge said he would not detain Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> but a hitch developed when prosecutors and defense lawyers could not agree on the property and cash to secure bail. Defense lawyers, who originally wanted Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> released without bail, had agreed to a bail package in which the couple would put up $ 1.2 million in Philippine pesos along with jewelry they brought to this country in 1986. But Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> LaBella </PERSON> balked, noting the jewelry is subject to subpoena in an ongoing grand jury investigation and the current <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> government has laid claim to the Marcoses' Philippine currency. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartko </PERSON> conceded `` there are conflicting claims to the property brought by the Marcoses to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>'' and that a federal judge in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> has frozen `` anything the <ORGANIZATION> Marcoses </ORGANIZATION> own anywhere in the world'' except for living expenses and lawyer fees. `` The Marcoses have been forced to live on borrowed funds,'' said <PERSON> Bartko </PERSON>, `` All of their collateral is subject to claims.'' <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> suggested putting up the hillside home the <ORGANIZATION> Marcoses </ORGANIZATION> occupy in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Makiki </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Bartko </PERSON> said the home was owned by an offshore corporation controlled by a Marcos co-defendant. Also suggested and rejected were the Marcoses' Swiss bank accounts and a home in <LOCATION> Woodside </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> eventually gave lawyers until Thursday morning to work out a plan They and Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> are to appear before him then if no agreement is reached.

<HEAD>Research Finds Hepatitis B Protein That May Switch On AIDS Genes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A test tube experiment shows that a protein produced in cells infected by the common liver disease hepatitis-B may activate production of the AIDS virus in human cells. Dr. T.S. <PERSON> Benedict </PERSON> <PERSON> Yen </PERSON>, an assistant professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, says the finding suggests an explanation of why almost 90 percent of AIDS patients are also infected by the hepatitis-B virus. But he cautions that more study must be done to determine the exact connection between the two viral infections. A team of scientists led by Yen studied the link between hepatitis-B and AIDS by inserting fragments of the hepatitis-B virus into human cell cultures containing the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, which causes AIDS. Yen said the group found that a protein produced by the hepatitis virus activates the production of the HIV genes, a necessary step in the replication of HIV. The protein produced by the hepatitis-B virus is called the `` X protein,'' said Yen, because it long had been a mystery. `` Nobody knew for a long time what it did or even if it existed or not,'' said Yen. `` Recently other people have found it can activate both its own expression and other viruses. We now know that includes HIV.'' Yen said researchers have long recognized that most AIDS patients are also infected with the hepatitis-B virus. `` That's the reason that for a while some people thought that hepatitis-B was the cause of AIDS,'' he said. Yen said it is believed that both AIDS and the hepatitis-B virus can infect the same cell at the same time. When this happens, <PERSON> Yen </PERSON> said, his studies suggest that the X-protein, which is produced only by hepatitis-B-infected cells, may contribute to the replication of the AIDS virus. Further studies, he said, are needed to confirm that AIDS patients have cells that are infected by both viruses. Also, he said, more study will be needed to verify that the X-protein is acting alone in triggering the reproduction of the AIDS virus. Yen said it could be that hepatitis-B is acting as an `` immune system stimulant'' and that it is this action that causes AIDS to replicate. He noted that other researchers have found that herpes simplex and a related virus both also cause cells to produce a protein that can stimulate the AIDS virus. The proteins from these two viruses, he said, are different from X-protein. Both AIDS and hepatitis-B can be transmitted by sexual contact and by the exchange of body fluids, such as blood. Both diseases are commonly prevalent among homosexual men and among intravenous drug users who share needles. Hepatitis-B attacks the liver and in severe cases can lead to jaundice, liver failure and death. There is a vaccine against the disease. AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a fatal disease that attacks the immune system and leaves the body defenseless against other diseases and some cancers. There currently is no vaccine against AIDS. A report on Yen's research was published Monday in the Proceedings of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>. Coauthors were <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Seto </PERSON> and Dr. <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Matija </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterlin </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> UCSF </ORGANIZATION>, and Jing-Hsiung Ou of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>.

 An <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> pet shop owner outraged at brokers of smuggled, possibly diseased Mexican parrots helped government agents run a two-year sting operation resulting in planned prosecutions in six states. <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Rueve </PERSON> said she and her husband, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, helped the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> investigate illegal parrot trafficking because `` it kind of rubbed me wrong'' when middlemen tried to sell them illegal birds. The investigation operated out of their Dayton-area Driftwood Pet Shops, where an undercover agent posed as the shops' parrot-buying agent from August 1986 to August 1988 The probe culminated Monday with the announcement that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> have agreed to seek indictments against 36 people the government believes have been buying parrots from smugglers who sneak them across the Mexican border near <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Two men already have pleaded guilty and are serving sentences in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, Ohio-based agent who for two years posed as the Rueves' bird buyer. `` <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> prohibits the commercial exportation of birds, but the dealers along the border in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> seem to operate in total impunity,'' he said Monday. `` It's a bad situation.'' The service had received complaints of the illegal trade for some time, but had trouble making cases because dealers claimed their birds were bred in captivity in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, he said. `` They dared you to prove they were n't bred here,'' he said. `` A bird selling on the border in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> for $ 100 can sell for $ 1,000 in a pet store,'' with certain exotic varieties bringing many times that, <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said that over the course of two years, he bought about 150 birds for $ 66,000. Investigators have seized parrots worth about $ 468,000, plus aircraft and vehicles worth another $ 93,000, the service said. Some of the birds seized during the operation are protected by a treaty outlawing international trade in them without permission of both the exporting and importing countries, or trade in officially listed endangered species under any circumstances. Those include the thick-billed parrot, an endangered species in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and thus illegal to import; and the black palm cockatoo and the scarlet macaw, illegal to import without permits from the Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the exporting country. Others include the double yellow-head <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> parrot and the Mexican redhead parrot, which may not be imported without export permits from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. In addition, yellow-nape parrots and red-lored parrots were seized because they were imported without undergoing quarantine, service spokeswoman <PERSON> Megan </PERSON> <PERSON> Durham </PERSON> said. Parrots may carry <ORGANIZATION> Newcastle </ORGANIZATION>'s disease, a highly contagious viral disease that can infect poultry, the service said.

 The legacy of the <LOCATION> Three </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> accident nearly 10 years ago includes 2.3 million gallons of radioactive water and continued debate over how much of the nuclear reactor's core melted A government scientist said Monday that at least half the material in the core melted during the March 1979 accident, a figure higher than most previous estimates. The material that melted included fuel and the tubes in which the fuel was contained, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Broughton </PERSON>, manager of the TMI-2 Accident Evaluation Program at the <ORGANIZATION> Idaho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>, said at a conference of the American Nuclear Society. `` Many of you may not be aware that at least 50 percent of the core melted during the accident,'' <PERSON> Broughton </PERSON> told industry officials. In the accident at the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> plant's Unit 2 reactor, uranium fuel was allowed to lose the vital cooling water that normally covers it, causing temperatures to rise dangerously in the core. <PERSON> Broughton </PERSON>'s estimate, based on an updated scenario of the accident, was higher than the 35 percent figure presented to the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on April 15, 1987, by <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> McPherson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>. As late as several years after the accident, it had been uncertain even whether any of the fuel had melted. <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Standerfer </PERSON>, who has directed the plant cleanup for <ORGANIZATION> GPU </ORGANIZATION> Nuclear, the plant operator, said in an interview that there was guesswork involved in figuring the core damage. `` It's not a science. They're just estimated numbers,'' <PERSON> Standerfer </PERSON> said. In 1986, he said, a scientist estimated that 70 percent of the core material liquefied _ a figure <PERSON> Standerfer </PERSON> said was too high. However, <PERSON> Standerfer </PERSON> said researchers had a better picture of the core now than ever before. `` Half the core clearly ended up as rubble, just undefined material,'' he said. `` What's important is that with the core damaged as badly as it was, it was maintained entirely in the reactor vessel.'' <PERSON> Broughton </PERSON> presented his remarks during a session in which executives of <ORGANIZATION> GPU </ORGANIZATION> Nuclear and former members of the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> convened to review lessons from the accident. `` To put TMI-2 into perspective, it was was a very useful event, one which could change the history of nuclear power and one which, I believe, in the end, changed it in a positive direction, rather than a negative one,'' said <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kintner </PERSON>, executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION> GPU </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION>. `` It was a good thing in that it provided a traumatic shock to all the institutions involved in nuclear energy applications _ a badly needed shock to make them aware of the special requirements for the safe use of this enormous new source of energy,'' he said. The TMI session was held as cleanup workers continued removing damaged fuel from the plant and performing other decontamination work in anticipation of mothballing the crippled Unit 2 reactor at the end of 1989. Its twin, Unit 1, continues to produce power. A troubling legacy of the accident remains 2.3 million gallons of water contaminated in the accident and in cleanup operations afterward. On Monday, two weeks of hearings before the Atomic Safety and <ORGANIZATION> Licensing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> began in <LOCATION> Lancaster </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, on the utility's request to boil away the water into the atmosphere. <PERSON> Standerfer </PERSON> said Monday that the water `` is clean enough now that any other reactor plant in the country could discharge it without approval'' by the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> or its information-gathering boards. However, citizens' groups favor leaving the water in storage tanks at the plant for the time being.

 A look at <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s election today for its 12th Knesset, or parliament:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>VOTERS AND POLLING</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Any Israeli citizen over age 18 is eligible to vote. There are 2.9 million registered voters, including 350,000 Arabs who live in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The country's total population is 4.4 million, including 750,000 Arabs. Included are 70,000 Jewish settlers who live in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> but are eligible to vote. Polls opened at 7 a.m. -LRB- midnight EST Monday -RRB- and close at 10 p.m. -LRB- 3 p.m. EST -RRB-. About 80 percent usually vote, and ballots are counted by hand.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>THE KNESSET</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION> has 120 members. Any Israeli citizen over the age of 21 is eligible for election.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>THE GOVERNMENT</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Israeli is a parliamentary democracy. The government is headed by a prime minister traditionally chosen from the party with the most seats in the <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION>. The prime minister forms a cabinet, which must be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION>.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>PARTIES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Israelis vote for parties, not individual candidates. The number of Knesset seats each wins depends on its proportion of the vote. Each party makes up numbered lists of candidates, and those gaining seats are chosen by their order on the list. Twenty-seven parties are running. The two major parties are the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc headed by Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and the left-of-center <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s history, neither major party has ever won an absolute majority, meaning the government is always a coalition and small parties have influence beyond their numbers. Labor and <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> each have three allied parties as likely coalition partners. There also are eight religious parties which use their seats as swing votes to gain backing for Jewish Orthodox causes; two Arab parties; an Arab-Jewish party that favors creating a Palestinian state, and eight others, most championing single causes.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>OPINION POLLS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Most polls predict a close race, either with <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> and its allies winning narrowly or a split vote that will again create a <ORGANIZATION> Labor-Likud </ORGANIZATION> coalition such as has governed since the last election in 1984. Then, neither major party could form a government without the other. The polls are regarded as less than reliable because most are sponsored by Labor or Likud. Also, most do not survey Arabs, religious Jews, soldiers and residents of collective farms.

<TEXT>
 Rep. <PERSON> Lindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON> has filed suit to determine who owns a gold, diamond and ruby brooch that turned up for sale at <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s auction house two years after she lost it. The <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Democrat filed the suit Monday against <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonanno </PERSON>, an antique jewelry dealer who bought the pin from a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> pawn shop, and <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which planned to sell it last year until Mrs. <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON> claimed ownership. The pin was made by <ORGANIZATION> Van </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cleef </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Arpels especially for Mrs. <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON>. It depicts a ballerina with arms outstretched. The dancer's face is set `` with an oval-shaped, rose-cut diamond, her headdress and costume studded with numerous rose-cut diamonds with small rubies,'' according to the <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s sale catalogue that listed the pre-sale price of $ 7,500 to $ 10,000. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleef </PERSON>'s said last year a replacement would cost $ 18,500. The brooch was given to Mrs. <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON> by an old friend, <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohlmeyer </PERSON>, 82, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> stockbroker who purchased it for $ 6,300 in 1983, according to the complaint filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON>, 72, lost the pin two years later and believes it was stolen, the lawsuit says. <PERSON> Kohlmeyer </PERSON>, described as Mrs. <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON>' `` best friend'' by her aide, <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoonmaker </PERSON>, offered to replace the pin last year. `` It was a unique thing that was made for her specially,'' said attorney <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Liebman </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> firm of <ORGANIZATION> Patton </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boggs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Blow.

A <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleef </PERSON>'s employee who sold the brooch to <PERSON> Kohlmeyer </PERSON> and discussed replacing it spotted the brooch in <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s December 1987 auction catalogue, the suit states. <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s withdrew it from the auction after <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleef </PERSON>'s confirmed that the serial number on the brooch in the catalogue matched the pin made for Mrs. <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON>, the complaint states The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> auction house sent Mrs. <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON>' attorney a letter on Dec. 22, 1987, stating that `` Sotheby's is not in a position to determine the merits of your client's claim of ownership. `` We will then, await your further advice as to whether an amicable resolution of this matter can be reached with the consignor, Mr. <PERSON> Bonanno </PERSON>. In the interim, the brooch will remain in our possession,'' the letter said. A Sotheby's spokeswoman, <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON>, declined to comment on the lawsuit, except to say the firm received no reply to the letter. <PERSON> Bonanno </PERSON> says he bought the pin in good faith and should be compensated for his investment. The owner of a <LOCATION> Fredericksburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, antique jewelry business, <PERSON> Bonanno </PERSON> said he purchased the pin for `` a couple thousand dollars'' from <ORGANIZATION> Livingston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> jewelry store and pawn shop. After Mrs. <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON> claimed ownership, <PERSON> Bonanno </PERSON> said he asked the pawn shop to reimburse him. `` They informed me they could n't give my money. They had cleared title with the police. It was never reported stolen,'' <PERSON> Bonanno </PERSON> said. `` If something was not reported stolen, in <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> pawn law it is not considered stolen merchandise.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has embraced the `` L word'' after weeks of avoiding it, and Republicans moved swiftly to exploit what they say is a misstep. `` After months of denying he was a liberal, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> conceded that he is one,'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign manager <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said. `` This is worse than a flip-flop. This is a gaffe bigger than putting himself in that tank.'' `` Miracle of miracles,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sarcastically said. With a week to go and facing long odds, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on Sunday said: `` I'm a liberal, in the tradition of <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Roosevelt </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>.'' It was a statement some had been urging <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to make, a defense of values as well as a political point of view long associated with <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> successes of old _ and <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> failures of late. But it was also viewed by Democrats themselves as a high-risk move by a candidate who trails nearly everywhere and has little choice but to roll the dice. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gearan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> made no mistake. He was advancing his `` I'm on your side'' argument, <PERSON> Gearan </PERSON> said, and asserting that it is he and not <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> who is in the tradition of those popular Democratic presidents. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had seemed to shy away from the word previously. In his second debate with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> quipped: `` If I had a dollar, <PERSON> George </PERSON>, for every time you used that label, I'd qualify for one of those tax breaks for the rich that you want to give away.'' After one debate statement by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told the vice president: `` I did n't hear the word ` liberal' or ` left' one time. I thank you for that.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has repeatedly asserted that such labels are meaningless and said he has conservative instincts as well. He points to his balanced budgets in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> as proof. In his interview on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Nightline'' last week, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is trying to misuse that label in a way which suggests that I'm somebody who does n't have a set of values.'' Any reluctance to embrace the word `` liberal'' can be understood with a glance at recent polls, which suggest it's no longer fashionable. Only 15 percent or so of the electorate accept that label to describe themselves _ even though many more may take `` liberal'' positions on specific issues. A <ORGANIZATION> CBS-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll conducted Oct. 8-10 was typical. It found 17 percent saying they were liberal, 34 percent saying they were conservative, and 43 percent identifying themselves as moderate. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, whose eight years in office have seen a growth in voter identification with conservatives, has been hammering <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with the liberal cudgel. In three speeches in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> one day recently, he used the word 50 times. The Republicans have used a handful of assertions to give a negative connotation to liberalism and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. They depict him as weak on defense, permissive toward crime, likely to raise taxes. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> succeeded in defining what a liberal is, in the most unflattering light possible,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Mellman </PERSON>, a pollster for Democratic candidates. `` Unfortunately to a lot of people right now to be a liberal means to be in favor of furloughs and in favor of higher taxes and so on. `` Those of us who call ourselves liberals, I think, would suggest that has nothing whatever to do with being a liberal and that's very much a distortion of what that ideological perspective is all about,'' <PERSON> Mellman </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on Sunday offered his own definition. He said liberalism means `` standing up for average Americans'' _ while also balancing budgets and recognizing fiscal constraints. As a three-term governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in fact was not known as a liberal. He was a moderate and a reformer in a state with a long liberal tradition. Liberals there assailed him for not doing enough on welfare, social services and the homeless. As governor, he faced Democratic primary challengers from the left as well as the right. Former House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, once the leader of liberal Democratic politics, last month disputed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s charge that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was liberal. `` Absolutely not,'' <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> said. `` He's progressive.'' But <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> politics is not the standard for politics elsewhere, and even <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> liberals acknowledge that. `` Being a centrist in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> makes him a liberal in general,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D-Mass., who often opposed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> from the left in their own state <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is a liberal in the `` broad sense'' _ that he sees a role for `` a vigorous public sector'' to help attain social goals. <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> suggested <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> might have had an easier time of it if he had accepted the liberal label earlier, and then spent time defining it in more favorable terms. `` He's made a tough task for himself _ to come in here at the end and try to redefine what liberal means,'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said. Democratic national chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> said liberalism means `` a prudent, positive, practical role for government, helping people.'' He suggested <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> might have moved sooner to defuse the issue. `` I'm one who happens to believe that as soon as the opening pitch is thrown you take a crack at it,'' <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> said. `` ... He might have done it earlier, but it's not too late.''

 For a sixth time, the leftist Sandinista government has extended for a month its truce with U.S.-backed rebels. President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> on Monday extended the 7-month-old cease-fire `` with the objective of enabling Contra -LRB- rebel -RRB- groups to put down their arms, take advantage of the amnesty and enter the normal life of the country,'' according to a statement released by his office. The cease-fire, yet another unilateral extension of a 30-day formal truce that took effect April 1, would have expired Nov. 1. The rebels have said the cease-fire is indefinite. The Sandinistas and rebels agreed on March 21 to halt offensive military operations. Two days later, they signed a pact to negotiate a lasting peace in the 8-year civil war. But talks on a definitive cease-fire stalemated in September. Each side has accused the other of violating the truce. The government newspaper Barricada on Monday urged Nicaraguans to prepare for a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion. Under the headline `` Rising Threat,'' an editorial said Honduran troops on Sunday harassed a Nicaraguan border village and accused <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> of what it called a recent series of cross-border attacks. The government claims the attacks are part of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan to provoke a border war with <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> troops then would invade to back <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. Most Contra fighters are at base camps just across the border in southern <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>.

 Polls notwithstanding, the presidential race is n't over until it's over, Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> tells television viewers in a new five-minute ad scheduled to run tonight on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. `` In recent days our campaign has been on the move. Thousands of Americans are joining our effort daily,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says. `` Next Tuesday, your one vote will be more powerful than all the pollsters and political commercials.'' Echoing his recent stump speeches, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor recalls the legacy of past <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> presidents and ridicules the Republican ticket's proposed capital gains tax break. `` Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Mr. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> know whose side they're on _ and it's not yours,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says `` What is their only new idea? A $ 40 billion capital gains tax giveaway for the very rich. If you make $ 200,000 a year you get $ 30,000 from Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. If you make $ 40,000 or less, you do n't get a dime.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also lays claim, on behalf of his party, to the `` kinder, gentler nation'' that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has invoked repeatedly since the GOP convention in August. `` I'm fighting for fundamental values _ the values that made the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> the party of the people; the values that make <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> a ` kinder, gentler nation,''' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says. A <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> administration will never try to cut college loans, he vows; it will make <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> first `` in health care, not infant mortality'' and get tough on nations that do n't open their markets to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> products. `` We'll sell cars and computers to the world _ not arms to the <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON>,'' says <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign also released long and short versions of an ad called `` Anthem,'' a feel-good musical spot scheduled to start Thursday. The ad features children, flags and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> at the Democratic convention, and lyrics that play on the ticket's `` best <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is yet to come'' theme. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> bought four slots for five-minute network commercials. He ran one five-minute spot twice last month. Tonight's is scheduled for 10:55 p.m. on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>; the fourth and final ad will air Saturday in slots on both <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign continued with two new economic spots introduced last week _ one positive, the other a blast at <LOCATION> Dukakis </LOCATION> _ as well as other spots including its famous `` tank'' ad mocking a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> tank ride and attacking his defense positions. <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullins </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> advertising aide, said the campaign would release a blitz of spots oriented to specific states, but declined to say where or when. In one of his new economic spots, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says 18 million jobs were created over the last six years, interest rates were cut in half, inflation is down, taxes are down and the economy is stronger. `` America is better off than we were eight years ago. And by building on the gains we've made, we'll all be better off in four years than we are today,'' he says. The other spot, called `` Tax Blizzard,'' shows a couple being bombarded by tax bills through their mail slot. It accuses <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of raising taxes on interest, dividends and meals, of raising corporate, payroll and state income taxes, and of signing a sales tax on items `` never taxable before.'' `` And now he wants to do for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> what he's done for <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>,'' says a narrator. `` American taxpayers ca n't afford that risk.''

 <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> says a public backlash over harsh criticism of his selection as <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Republican running mate has bolstered the ticket. `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people have a very distinct antenna for fairness, and they know I have n't been treated fairly,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said Monday. `` And I think there's a lot of sympathy out there for <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>.'' The question of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s impact on <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> prospects was raised anew as the senator arrived to campaign here. Told during a local television interview that some <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> editorial writers had questioned his selection, even while endorsing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> denied that he was a burden to the ticket. `` That's absolute nonsense, and you know it,'' he said. `` As a matter of fact, since I've been put on the ticket, we've done quite well,'' he said `` You recall, before I was on the ticket, we were down about 16 or 17 points. We're ahead now.'' The <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator, in the weeks immediately following his selection by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> during the August GOP convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, was besieged by questions about his enlistment in the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> in 1969, during the height of the Vietnam War, and his grades at <ORGANIZATION> DePauw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has said that no rules were broken in connection with the <ORGANIZATION> Naional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> sign-up, and that he was a `` C'' student at <ORGANIZATION> DePauw </ORGANIZATION>, but did better in law school. The senator was appearing at a local high school for a rally today before traveling to his native <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> to tour a steel plant and appear at a fund-raising reception for <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> gubernatorial candidate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mutz </PERSON>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was in a mostly upbeat mood Monday as he toured parts of western <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and visited a ski resort in north-central <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> before traveling to <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, where he rounded out the day taking part in a basketball game with aides and traveling press. The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidate said that if he had his druthers, he would debate <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential opponent <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> a second time. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> complained that reporters participating in the <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, debate last month never put <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> on the spot concerning what the Texan would do if the presidency suddenly fell to him. `` But he was n't the target,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` I was the target.'' Asked if he would like a second shot at <LOCATION> Bentsen </LOCATION>, the senator replied, `` my own preference is, yes.'' But he said that `` it's really too late. In the meantime, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> got a measure of revenge against <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> for the Texan's memorable debate declaration that `` you're no <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>.'' Chiding Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for identifying himself Sunday with <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> liberals of yesteryear such as <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, `` Yes, I did n't know <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and I did n't serve with <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, but I'll tell you one thing, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is no <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>.'' `` In 1960, President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> campaigned for the presidency on the very basis of building a strong strategic defense to protect <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` The man from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> is campaigning on cutting back on our national defense. He refuses to commit to modernizing our strategic deterrence, wants to ban flight testing of missiles and proposed to slash our carrier task forces.'' `` Can you imagine <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> having to ride around in a tank to prove they're tough on national defense?'' he asked.

 A collision of two helicopters was the apparent cause of a crash that killed four <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> during a training exercise on <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> military authorities said today. It was the second time in a week that <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> fliers were involved in fatal collisions in flight. Last Tuesday, nine <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> and an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officer died in a training crash in the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> desert, and <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> officials said the two helicopters they were in apparently collided in flight. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liaison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> announced Monday that four Marines had been killed in a crash on the southern Japanese island of <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION> that day, but no cause of the crash was given. Today, it issued a statement saying two CH-46 helicopters `` apparently collided while conducting routine training operations.'' One of the big twin-rotor copters crashed in mountainous terrain, killing all four men aboard, the other returned to <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futenma </ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION> with damage in the nose area but no injuries aboard, it said. The cause of the crash was under further investigation, the office said. The crash occurred in such difficult terrain that rescuers had to be lowered on ropes from a helicopter to reach the wreckage. Meanwhile, Japanese Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sosuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> expressed regret over the crash and concern at what might have happened if the collision had occurred over a populated area. He also said the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> had asked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military authorities to look into reports of live ammunition having been found after military exercises on <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION> and stray bullets hitting houses. `` There is rather a lot of carelessness,'' he said. His comments pointed to underlying friction between Japanese civilians and the military on <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION>, where about 30,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops are based. The Marine fliers were on six-month assignment to <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION> for training from their base at <LOCATION> Kaneohe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> statement said. It identified the four killed as Maj. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisloeffel </PERSON>, 34, of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cajon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; Capt. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, 31, of Bend, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, whose wife <PERSON> Constance </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> lives in <LOCATION> Kaneohe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>; Cpl. <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Timmons </PERSON>, 20, of Isle Of Palms, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, whose wife <PERSON> Stacy </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Timmons </PERSON> lives in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>; and Cpl. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dehn </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, 20, of <LOCATION> Glendale </LOCATION>, Ore.

 Republican strategists are pouring $ 1 million into a final-week advertising effort to tie their <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> candidates to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, hoping the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential front-runner's strength will give them a boost in selected cliffhanger races. At the same time, the ads are designed to exploit what the Republicans say is Democratic standard-bearer <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' unpopularity in some states, said <PERSON> Jann </PERSON> <PERSON> Olsten </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senatorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> `` We're not so naive as to believe this will dictate the outcome in each and every state around the country,'' <ORGANIZATION> Olsten </ORGANIZATION> said Monday at a briefing. But he said the generic `` vote Republican'' television spots would help <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidates in close contests remind voters of the differences between the two parties on matters of taxes and the economy. One of the ads notes the `` No new taxes'' pledge made by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> but characterized as unrealistic by other Republicans, including <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan. `` Democrats will raise taxes,'' the ad states `` Republicans wo n't. It's that simple.'' Democrats dismissed the move to maximize <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s coattails, saying he does n't have any in the first place. `` We do n't see any coattails,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Chlopak </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Olsten </ORGANIZATION>'s counterpart at the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senatorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> `` I think there are individual dynamics in each of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> races, and you just ca n't explain a Democrat leading in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> down big, and Democrats doing well in other states where <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was losing.'' Analysts constantly debate whether coattails exist. When they do appear, it often is because of a presidential candidate with a strong personal appeal or because of an overriding national mandate. Democrats say <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has neither. `` If there's one thing <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has not done in this campaign, it's convey a mandate, on taxes or any other issue,'' <PERSON> Chlopak </PERSON> said. `` It's a lot easier to know what he dislikes than what he stands for. For <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> candidates to attach themselves to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sort of falls through the cracks.'' The converse of that _ tying one's opponent to underdog <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> _ is seen by some GOP <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> contenders as a potential boost in states where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> holds wide margins. `` There is a dynamic at work, driven in large part by the presidential election,'' <ORGANIZATION> Olsten </ORGANIZATION> said. States where the ads will appear include <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Olsten </ORGANIZATION> said the ads would help candidates who want to `` press their opponents on what values they share and do n't share with <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.'' A <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign spokesman said the candidate would n't be going out of his way to help <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> candidates, however. `` We are not in a position yet where we have the luxury of comfort in some of these states,'' said the spokesman, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON>. `` We do n't feel our margins in some of these target states are at a level where we can afford to turn our sights away from our principal objective.''

 Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, blending mild praise with sharp criticism, says Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is `` a decent man, no doubt'' but would bring a return `` to weakness, inexperience and recession.'' Entering the final week of the presidential campaign, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appeared intent Monday on addressing the perception that he has been too personally critical of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, his Democratic opponent. At a rally in the recently refurbished Union Station in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> added a new dimension to his stump speech by saying that while <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was `` an inexperienced governor,'' he also was `` a decent man, no doubt, good family ... good with his family and they interact together.'' Quickly switching to the attack mode, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I do n't want this country to take a dangerous risk on an inexperienced liberal governor coming out of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, trying to run this country.'' By the next stop in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had dropped the praise and stepped up the criticism. `` The choice is simple: whether we are going to build on the peace and prosperity that we struggled so hard to attain these past eight years, whether we're going to pass on a sound and secure <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to our children and our grandchildren, or risk it all on a return to weakness, inexperience and recession _ out from the mainstream values,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. While <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has a sizable but narrowing lead in the polls, there are indications that the voters are not happy with the way he is waging his campaign. A Gallup poll taken for the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> company found that respondents, by a 52-43 percent margin, felt <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had been too critical of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. The same poll, released Monday, showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with a 50-42 percent lead among all voters surveyed and a 52-41 percent edge among likely voters. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was spending this morning in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, taping an interview with television personality <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Frost </PERSON>. Then he was flying to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bend </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, for an address at Notre Dame, and traveling to <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> for a rally. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will spend the night in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, where he will campaign on Wednesday. <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, the homestate of his running mate, Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, seems safe territory for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> remain key battleground states, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s strategists are planning his travel in the final days with an eye on states where the race is close. In addition to dealing with the problem of whether he's been too tough on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also spent part of Monday addressing criticism that the campaign has been dominated by negative television advertising and devoid of real issues. Waving a 347-page compilation of his speeches and position papers dating back to his announcement as a candidate on Oct. 12, 1987, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` Here's a message I've tried to deliver about sensible mainstream leaderhip and it's all right here. `` And yes, I have been talking about the issues and the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are listening and I believe that's why I'm going to win,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` This is our agenda.'' He derided <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for finally embracing the liberal label that Republicans have been pinning on him. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on Sunday said he was a liberal in the tradition of former Presidents <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. `` Miracle of miracles. Headline. Read all about it,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> chortled. `` My opponent finally ... called himself the big L, called himself a liberal.'' Noting that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had challenged him to an election eve debate, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` We do n't need any more debates. We had'em.''

Sunday's firebomb attack on a bus that killed 27-year-old schoolteacher <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> and her children was expected to boost the chances of Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, who advocates tougher measures against the Arab uprising in the occupied lands. `` There's no question it will help <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Elazar </PERSON>, a political analyst of the <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>. `` For most voters, this will only reconfirm their beliefs, but for those voters sitting on the fence something like this could push them off to the right.'' <PERSON> Zeev </PERSON> <PERSON> Eitan </PERSON>, a political analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Tel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviv </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Jaffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` In this election, that could be the difference between a clear victory by one party or a tie.'' Polls taken before the attack and published Monday in the newspaper Maariv either gave <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> the edge or indicated a dead heat similar to the one that forced <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> and the center-left <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> into a `` national unity'' coalition in 1984. Four different polls indicated Labor, led by Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, and its left-wing partners would win 47-55 of the <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION>'s 120 seats, with <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> and its allies getting 56-65. Some seats are expected to be taken by three Arab-oriented parties whose strong support of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> make them unacceptable in either major party's coalitions To guard against violence on election day, authorities ordered 14,000 police, border guards and other security personnel into the 17 election districts, which have 5,000 polling places. Final results were not expected before Wednesday and days may be needed to determine a clear winner, if there is one in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s complicated coalition politics A 48-hour travel ban prevented the 1.5 million Palestinian residents of the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> from entering or returning from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. It began at 11 p.m. Monday and also barred press coverage without army escort in the territories, where Palestinians have been in revolt since Dec. 8 against 21 years of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation. An army spokesman said privately the purpose was to ensure a quiet election and had nothing to do with the the attack on the Israeli bus Sunday nignt in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Jericho </LOCATION>. The killings prompted calls for revenge by leading politicians competing in an election that is expected to be a major element in deciding the future of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, a former defense minister and senior <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> politician, blamed Labor for the attack. He said the party's willingness to exchange occupied land for peace encouraged Palestinian violence `` All talk of withdrawal or pullbacks brings more and more firebomb attacks,'' he was quoted as saying by the newspaper Hadashot. He called for creation of special military units to `` eliminate terrorists and rioters.'' <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> opposes trading land for peace. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> spoke out for swift punishment of Palestinians responsible for the bus attack, which <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said `` provide nothing the way of hope for a solution'' to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Campaign rhetoric became increasingly harsh in the final days as the rivals sought to attract undecided voters, who pollsters say total 4 percent to 8 percent of the 2.9 million Israelis registered. An unsigned advertisement in Sunday's edition of Maariv included a photograph of <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> and Prime Minister <PERSON> Neville </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> meeting in <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> in 1938, with `` international conference'' printed below. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> has supported Arab demands for an international conference on <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace, including the future of the occupied territories. Labor immediately accused <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> of a `` horrific propaganda campaign'' and demanded an apology. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> denied paying for the ad and threatened to file a $ 10 million slander suit against Labor. A leaflet distributed by the underground <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leadership in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> urged <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers to vote for parties favoring an international conference. Soldiers voted at their bases and in the field Sunday and Monday. `` Dear soldiers, your leaders know very well that the Palestinian Arab uprising will not be crushed by force and they know that the solution is political,'' said the leaflet, printed in <LOCATION> Hebrew </LOCATION>. `` Vote for stopping the new <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> hand, vote for the international conference.''

<TEXT>
 Nine-year-old <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> <PERSON> DeShaney </PERSON> can make some awkward movements and guttural sounds and will need special care throughout his life because of a beating more than four years ago that left him brain damaged. The boy's mother blames a <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> county welfare agency for not preventing the injuries inflicted by the boy's father, and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> will hear arguments in her lawsuit Wednesday. `` We ca n't restore the tissue that's missing from <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON>'s brain, but we can make sure little <PERSON> Suzie </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> does n't become another <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, an attorney for <PERSON> Melody </PERSON> <PERSON> DeShaney </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Ms. <PERSON> DeShaney </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, filed the lawsuit on behalf of her son against the <ORGANIZATION> Winnebago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> and two of its employees. The multimillion-dollar lawsuit accuses social workers of violating the boy's consitutional rights by failing to come to his rescue after they had repeated evidence he was being beaten. `` They had a mountain of direct evidence that was higher than their eyebrows,'' said <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> DeShaney </PERSON> appealed the case to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> after the 7th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> dismissed the suit, saying it would place welfare agencies in an unfair predicament to require them to take custody of children who are suspected victims of abuse. Lawyers for <LOCATION> Winnebago </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, located in east-central <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> about 80 miles from <LOCATION> Wausau </LOCATION>, have said the case could put public employees in the impossible position of always having to make the right decisions or face lawsuits. The case is being watched very closely by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Counties </ORGANIZATION>, which filed a friend-of-the-court brief. `` We're all feeling very vulnerable,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Quam </PERSON>, director of social services for <LOCATION> Winnebago </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. `` It popped up here, but it could have happened anywhere.'' <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> was living in the county with his divorced father when he came to the attention of social workers. A county social worker assigned to his case visited the boy several times and a file of reports grew. Social worker <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemmeter </PERSON> reported she noticed a bump on <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON>'s head one time and `` a scraped chin that appeared to me to look like a cigarette burn'' another time. Ms. <PERSON> Kemmeter </PERSON> visited the <PERSON> DeShaney </PERSON> home on March 7, 1984, but did not ask to see the boy, according to court records. The next day, the then 4-year-old boy was in the hospital with head injuries that destroyed half of his brain. His father, <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> DeShaney </PERSON>, was later convicted of felony battery and child abuse and sentenced to two consecutive two-year prison terms. He served about two years and eight months before he was released in September 1987. <PERSON> DeShaney </PERSON>, who lives in central <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Portage </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and declines interview requests, will finish his parole Dec. 11, said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Netzel </PERSON>, his parole agent. <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> remains in the custody of the county and lives in a group home for children who are developmentally disabled, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bodnar </PERSON>, attorney for <LOCATION> Winnebago </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. The boy has no use of his legs or one arm and can only make awkward movements with one hand, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON>'s intelligence has been tested at less than a 1-year-old's, he said His mother wants custody but has filed no formal legal petition because she wants to be sure she can provide care for him first, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. `` We're going to ask -LRB- for -RRB- the money for <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON>,'' he said. Ms. <PERSON> DeShaney </PERSON>, who gave custody of her infant son to her former husband when she was divorced at 19, declined an interview request because of the pressures of the case, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. The fact that the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has decided to hear the case concerns the counties' association, said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruck </PERSON>, the general counsel for the Washington-based association. Counties acknowledge a general duty to protect everyone in the county, but that is not a guarantee everyone will be protected, he said. The case could raise a new class of lawsuits that not only review public employees' decisions with hindsight but may `` Monday-morning-quarterback a decision not to get in the game,'' <PERSON> Ruck </PERSON> said.

 The dollar rebounded against the Japanese yen Tuesday, and share prices also rose on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The dollar closed at 125.30 yen, up 0.30 yen from Monday's close of 125.00 yen.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is following an old performer's adage in the waning days of his administration _ every time he gives a speech, he tries to leave them laughing. Lately, at the end of each address, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> confesses he's got `` a new hobby,'' and proceeds to relate a joke he says, `` I can absolutely prove ... is invented by the people of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and told among themselves.'' And at a recent speech before the World Affairs Council, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> seemed to be enjoying himself so much he told not one, but several. Here are a few, in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s words: `` You know, in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, for a private citizen to buy an automobile, there is a 10-year waiting period. ... You have to put the money down too, 10 years in advance. `` So this man has gone in and he's doing all the signing, all the papers, and putting out his money. `` And finally when he makes that final signature the man behind the counter said, ` Now, come back in 10 years and take delivery.' `` And the man asked, ` Morning or afternoon?' `` And man behind the counter said, ` Well, 10 years from now, what difference does it make?' `` ` Well,' the man answered, ` the plumber's coming in the morning.'''

 <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> went on to tell one joke he said he'd relayed to Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> added, `` laughed quite heartily.'' `` An <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and a Russian are arguing about their two countries. And the American said, ` Look, I can go into the Oval Office, pound the president's desk and say, ` Mr. President, I do n't like the way you're running our country. `` And the Russian said, ` I can do that.' ` And the American said, ` You can?' And the Russian said, ` I can go into the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>, into the general secretary's office, I can pound on his desk and say, ` Mr. General Secretary, I do' t like the way President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s running his country.

 The president claimed <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> chuckled at this one, as well: `` You know, less than one family out of seven in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> owns an automobile. Most of the automobiles are driven by the bureaucrats _ the government furnishes them and drivers and so forth. `` So an order went out one day to the police that anyone caught speeding _ anyone, no matter who _ gets a ticket. `` Well, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> came out of his country home, his dacha; he was late getting to the Kremlin. There was his limousine and driver waiting. `` He told the driver to get in the back seat, he'd drive. And down the road he went. `` They passed two motorcycle cops. One took out after him, and pretty soon he's back with his buddy. And his buddy says, ` Well, did you give him a ticket?' And his buddy says, ` No.' `` ` Well,' he said, ` Why not?' `` Oh,' the cop said, ` Too important.' `` ` Well,' his buddy said, ` We're told to give anybody a ticket, no matter who it is.' `` ` Oh,' the cop said, ` No, no. This one was _ too important, I could n't.'' `` ` Well,' the buddy said, ` Who was it?' `` I could n't recognize him,' the cop said, ` But his driver was <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>.'''

 Here's one <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he `` would n't dare tell'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>: `` They had me in his limousine, with General Secretary <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, and the head of my <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> unit, and his chief security person. And we were ... sightseeing. `` And we pulled up by a waterfall. And supposedly we got out of the car to look at the waterfall and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said to my <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> man, ` Go ahead, jump, go over the fall.' `` And he said, ` I've got a wife and three kids!' `` So <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> turned to his own man, and said, ` Jump, go over the waterfall.' And he did. `` Well, my man scrambled down the rocks around the bottom and found the fellow wringing out his clothes, and apparently all right. `` And he said, ` Well, when he told you to jump and go over the falls _ why did you do that?' `` And the Soviet said, ` I've got a wife and three kids!'''

<HEAD>As President, Bush Might Withhold Information About His Health</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who doctors say is in excellent health, says disclosures about his physical condition as president would `` depend on what's happening in the world,'' according to an interview published today. Because such medical news `` might send markets plummeting or rising _ it would have to be sorted out by good standards,'' the vice president said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. `` If I did n't feel good today I would n't feel I had to rush out and have a press conference about it.'' Doctors interviewed said the 64-year-old <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is in excellent health. He runs two miles three or four times a week, has coffee and fruit for breakfast, and keeps his weight at 195 pounds. He is 6-foot-2. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he has had a few sleepless nights lately because he is worried about the election, but that he hates taking sleeping pills. He also said he handles stress much better today than he did 20 years ago, when he was a chronic worrier and suffered from two ulcers. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s doctors said the vice president has a mild enlargement of the prostate gland but that they do not expect corrective surgery to be necessary in the next four years. In 1986, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had a basal cell skin cancer removed from his face, but he has no symptoms of other cancers. He is allergic to bee stings but is receiving immunotherapy injections to stave off potentially life-threatening allergic reactions.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> mocked <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' sudden embrace of liberalism as the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nominee courted disenchanted Democrats. <PERSON> Underdog </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, in an appeal to women voters, assailed the Reagan-Bush administration for `` being on the wrong side'' of issues important to women. With Election Day exactly one week away _ and polls indicating a sizable but narrowing Republican lead, the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> ticket of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> exploited <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' claim that he is a liberal in the tradition of former Presidents <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. `` Miracle of miracles. Headline. Read all about it,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told an audience Monday in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION> `` My opponent finally ... called himself the big L, called himself a liberal.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> retuned Democratic opponent <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s debate putdown line of `` You're no <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'' to poke fun at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is no <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>,'' said the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator as he campaigned in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, seeking the support of women voters, said the Democrats are `` on your side'' on the issues of abortion, equal pay and parental leave. The Republican ticket, however, has been `` on the wrong side of every issue of special importance to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women.'' The Democratic nominee was campaigning today in <LOCATION> Youngstown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. He also was telling voters in a new five-minute ad scheduled to run tonight on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> that the race for the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is far from over. `` In recent days our campaign has been on the move. Thousands of Americans are joining our effort daily,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says. `` Next Tuesday, your one vote will be more powerful than all the pollsters and political commercials.'' Two new polls _ a survey by <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> and another done by Gallup for the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> _ showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> maintaining a strong lead among likely voters. In the Harris survey of 1,250 voters questioned during the weekend, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> led <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> 52-45 percent, a slight narrowing from 53-44 percent in a similar poll done Oct. 14-17. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> poll of 1,505 likely voters conducted Oct. 23-26 found <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ahead by 11 points, 52-41 percent. Both polls had margins of error of plus or minus three points. The front-running Republican ticket was concentrating on the Midwest today. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was speaking about law and order this afternoon at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Notre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dame </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bend </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, and campaigning in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> after taping an interview this morning with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Frost </PERSON>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was stumping in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and his home state of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. Democratic candidate <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was focusing on his home state of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. Former Democratic contender <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> joined <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> Monday night at a rally in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where the preacher-turned-politician responded to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s `` read my lips'' refrain. `` You watch our hips as we march,'' to the voting booth, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told the crowd at the <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Olive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator urged those in the audience to get out and vote. `` Do n't tell me your vote does n't count _ it does,'' he said. While <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> focused on <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and its third-largest electoral prize of 29 votes, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> sought support in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and its biggest electoral bounty of 47 votes. In his major appeal to women voters, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said the Republican ticket wanted to outlaw abortions. `` I believe a choice that personal must be made by the woman in the exercise of her beliefs,'' the Democratic nominee told an audience in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> cited <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s response to an 11-year-old girl's question last week about what she should do if she was raped by her father and became pregnant The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidate said that he favored childbirth over abortion even under those circumstances. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also challenged <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to an hour-long debate the night before the election, but the Republican nominee scoffed at his rival's idea and suggested that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> debate himself. `` The New Left versus the Old Left,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. The vice president, ostensibly concerned about a slight decrease in his lead, appealed to what he called `` abandoned Democrats,'' those left behind as he says the party moves away from the mainstream. `` So, my pitch here, in the last eight days, is to those good Democrats, the rank and file,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said during a stop in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION> `` I tell them: Have hope, have confidence.'' The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign also continued with two new economic ads, a positive spot citing the accomplishments of the Reagan-Bush administration and a negative commercial showing a couple inundated with tax bills. That ad accuses <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of consistently raising taxes, and the narrator concludes, `` And now he wants to do for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> what he's done for <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. American taxpayers ca n't afford that risk. The topic of ads arose in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s interview with NBC News anchorman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON>, who questioned the vice president about whether his commercial saying ` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> led the way' on the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was an exaggeration. `` Well, I hope it did n't indicate that I was out in front of the president,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. The vice president said he gives `` great credit to the arms control negotiators, and obviously the most credit to the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' Pressed as to why that is not mentioned in the ad, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied: `` Well, they're not running for president, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>, and I am.''

 Votes by 14 utilities to approve a $ 226 million settlement in the giant <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supply </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> fraud </ORGANIZATION> trial remove a `` burr in the saddle'' for the state, the governor says. The 14 public utilities from around the state voted Monday to approve the settlement that would let them out of the trial, which stems from <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION>' record default on $ 2.25 billion in bonds used to finance construction of two nuclear power plants that never were completed. The agreement, which also involves the state of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and the federal <ORGANIZATION> Bonneville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, leaves <ORGANIZATION> Snohomish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utility </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> the only remaining utility defendant. `` It's an opportunity to get it behind us,'' Gov. <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> said of the settlement. It removes a `` burr in the saddle.'' Snohomish contracted for the biggest single share, 13 percent, on the two partially built <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> plants that were abandoned in 1982. Under the settlement memorandum, <PERSON> Snohomish </PERSON> would be allowed to settle until Nov. 10. Snohomish officials said they welcomed the settlement proposal, even though they were not included. Attorney <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> said there was a risk remaining in trial, but it appeared settlement figures were coming down as the trial progressed and that could work to his utility district's benefit. But <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> and other Snohomish officials would not comment on the possibility of settlement, which would call for it to pay $ 48.7 million, based on the size of its interest in the abandoned plants. Other defendants remaining include two engineering firms and a financial advisor firm, out of nearly 100 entities originally sued. The trial, which was moved to <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, was recessed last week when attorneys reported a settlement was possible. It was scheduled to resume Wednesday. `` It's a -LRB- settlement -RRB- we can certainly live with and handle, and it wo n't have great diverse ... impact on our state,'' said <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Malanca </PERSON>, who engineered the agreement. Under the agreement, the 14 utilities would pay $ 181 million, <ORGANIZATION> BPA </ORGANIZATION> and the federal government would pay $ 35 million and the state would pay $ 10 million to plaintiffs who sued after <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> defaulted in 1983. The plants were begun but never finished after regional energy planners determined power from the plants would n't be needed. The region's economy suffered when <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> attempted to build five multi-billion dollar nuclear power plants and finished only one. Several utilities that agreed to the settlement said rate increases may be necessary but would be small. The governor said the state would pay $ 10 million toward the settlement, if the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> concurs. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state is not a defendant in the case, but a settlement should end a separate lawsuit against it involving the same plaintiffs, who are suing to recover $ 7.5 billion _ the $ 2.3 billion default plus interest. <ORGANIZATION> BPA </ORGANIZATION> participation still requires the approval of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>, which was expected this week, and final approval will have to come from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Browning </PERSON>, who is overseeing the case. `` A settlement now will put one of the region's major problems behind us,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jura </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> BPA </ORGANIZATION>. `` It would enable us to devote more of our time, attention and legal talent to productive work.'' Besides <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION> City Light, utilities agreeing to the settlement are the city of <LOCATION> Ellensburg </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cowlitz </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> No. 3, <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, <PERSON> Grays </PERSON> <PERSON> Harbor </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Okanogan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Skamania </LOCATION>, Wahkiakum, <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Klickitat </LOCATION> county Public Utility Districts. <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION> director of utilities <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Coates </PERSON> said the settlement would bring to $ 591 million the amount paid to plaintiffs. A class of more than 24,000 past and present bondholders and <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, a trustee for bondholders, are plaintiffs in the trial that began Sept. 7 and was expected to last a year. They alleged the defendants conspired to lie and hide information that might have discouraged potential investors.

 A generation after his polite parody of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s family sold millions of records, <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> <PERSON> Meader </PERSON> is playing honky-tonk music in out-of-the-way bars and enjoying life in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>'s `` slow lane.'' `` The First Family,'' which depicted JFK in press conferences, family settings at the White House and meetings with heads of state, sold more than 5 million copies before Nov. 22, 1963, when it became funny no longer. <PERSON> Meader </PERSON>, then commanding top billings around the country for his Kennedy impressions, got the grim news of the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> assassination from a cabbie in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> while en route to a gig. `` I said, ` What's the punch line?''' recalled <PERSON> Meader </PERSON>, 52. `` Then I heard it on the radio. `` I felt a sense of loss, that we lost something special,'' said <PERSON> Meader </PERSON>, then a strikingly handsome man in his late 20s. `` I went into deep hibernation.'' After two months in seclusion, <PERSON> Meader </PERSON> tried to renew his act, without <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> humor, but bookings continued to be canceled. `` I was a reminder of that tragedy,'' <PERSON> Meader </PERSON>, who has a gray beard and often sports a cowboy hat, recalled somberly in an interview. `` It was over.'' `` As <PERSON> Lenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> said, that day they dug two graves in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, one for <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and one for <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> <PERSON> Meader </PERSON>,'' said the ex-comic, who after the assassination stopped using <PERSON> Meader </PERSON>, his middle name, and started to go by the surname he was given at birth, <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON>. Lighthearted and respectful by today's bare-knuckled standards of political humor, `` The First Family'' also featured sound-alikes of <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON>, <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. `` It was very daring at the time,'' said <PERSON> Meader </PERSON>, whose performing career began in his <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> days in the mid-1950s when he formed a country band. His act then was sprinkled with <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Snow </PERSON> imitations. <PERSON> Meader </PERSON> studied broadcast technique in 1959 and began a career as a piano-playing comic at small <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> clubs. He grew tired of mother-in-law jokes, and about 1960, as the JFK juggernaut gained full momentum, he injected political humor into his act. He brushed his hair into his face like <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and did impressions of the charismatic <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> senator `` because I had a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> accent anyway,'' said <PERSON> Meader </PERSON>, who was born in <LOCATION> Waterville </LOCATION> and lives in this small city. The act took off when <PERSON> Meader </PERSON> closed an appearance on the `` Talent Scouts'' television program with a <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> news conference, winning <PERSON> Meader </PERSON> critical acclaim, TV appearances and billings at some of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s top clubs. He was pictured in Life, jabbing his finger a la <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> at a mock news conference. After being turned down repeatedly by record companies that did not want to take a chance with political humor, `` The First Family'' finally appeared in 1962 on the <ORGANIZATION> Cadence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> label. It was recorded before an audience of 200 on the night <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> announced a naval blockade to keep Soviet missiles from reaching <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> in October 1962. `` If the audience had heard that speech, the album would have never gotten off the ground,'' <PERSON> Meader </PERSON> said. A few cuts on the air by a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> disc jockey sent listeners to their phones demanding more, said <PERSON> Meader </PERSON>. It became a runaway hit, selling 1.2 million copies within two weeks and 5 million copies within a year, earning <PERSON> Meader </PERSON> $ 700,000. The jacket, which pictured <PERSON> Meader </PERSON> and the other performers lined up in family-album fashion in front of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, also included a disclaimer explaining it was not meant to hurt anyone's feelings and that it `` is for fun. JFK seemed more amused than annoyed, remarking, `` I thought it sounded more like Teddy than it did me.'' By 1963, only four years after breaking into show business, <PERSON> Meader </PERSON> was among the brightest new stars of the day, and his nightclub act commanded $ 4,000 to $ 12,500 a week. He began work on a second `` First Family'' volume and cut a single in which <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> tells his daughter `` The Night Before Christmas,'' also a parody. Then, 25 years ago this month, came the assassination. <PERSON> Meader </PERSON> said he lost interest in working and was `` spending most of my time in bars.'' By the late'60s, he was living in hippie mecca <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, wearing flowers in his hair and beads, and making money by playing piano and writing music. During his `` wine, women, song and drugs'' period that followed his meteoric rise, <PERSON> Meader </PERSON> wandered about the country, staying with friends in diverse accommodations: a teepee, a houseboat, a log cabin. <PERSON> Meader </PERSON> landed back in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in 1971 and recorded a humor album, based on a visit by <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION>. `` The Second Coming'' received minimal airplay because of what many considered offensive religious references. After moving to <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, in 1972, <PERSON> Meader </PERSON> returned to his roots as a performer and formed a country band called the <ORGANIZATION> Honky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tonk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angels </ORGANIZATION>. Later, he moved to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to play movie sound tracks, and even took small parts in movies. He has not done any <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> material since the president's death. In 1977, <PERSON> Meader </PERSON> returned home to <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, where he lives with his fourth wife and plays piano with his five-piece country-bluegrass band, Gone Fishin', which specializes in what he calls `` saloon, good time, honky tonk'' music. His act is billed at resorts in such recreational areas as <LOCATION> Moosehead </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Squaw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION>, and in small nightspots around <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. `` I love it,'' he said, describing <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> as `` the slow lane _ home.'' Even if he had a chance to return to the big time, he would turn the opportunity down, saying, `` That's for youth.'' `` That's like asking <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> to play for the <ORGANIZATION> Dodgers </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Meader </PERSON>. `` He could n't hit the ball past first base.''

<HEAD>Military Conviction of Galtieri Junta Upheld in Civil Court</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Former President and army chief Gen. <PERSON> Leopoldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Galtieri </PERSON> lost his appeal of a 12-year sentence and conviction of negligence in losing the 1982 Falklands War with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. A civilian court on Monday upheld a military court's decision against <PERSON> Galtieri </PERSON> and the two other members of his former junta, Adm. <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Anaya </PERSON> and Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Basilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Lami </PERSON> <PERSON> Dozo </PERSON> and stripped them of their ranks. The four-judge federal appeals panel upheld the May 1986 convictions by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>. It also adjusted the sentences for <PERSON> Anaya </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lami </PERSON> <PERSON> Dozo </PERSON> to 12 years, reducing <PERSON> Anaya </PERSON>'s by two years and increasing <PERSON> Lami </PERSON> <PERSON> Dozo </PERSON>'s by four. The retired commanders-in-chief of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s army, navy and air force have been in jail since 1984; their sentences run through February 1996. Their pensions, while technically denied to them, will be paid to their wives. The three, all in uniform, sat impassively, arms crossed, through the 90-minute hearing, and returned to military prison afterward. Defense attorneys said final appeals may be lodged with the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The court also upheld the acquittals of three other retired officers who were instrumental in carrying out the 74-day <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> war _ <PERSON> Gens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Menendez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Parada </PERSON>, and Vice Adm. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Lombardo </PERSON>. On April 2, 1982, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> invaded the <LOCATION> Falkland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, off its south coast, which have been ruled by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> since 1833. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> claims it inherited the archipelago, which it calls the Malvinas, upon asserting independence from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> in 1810. `` There was no planning ... -LRB- other than -RRB- the occupation of the islands,'' panel president <PERSON> Horacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cattani </PERSON> said in reading the sentence. `` The British reaction was a possible alternative that was not taken into consideration.'' The defendants pleaded innocent. British Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> sent a task force to the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> and, after fighting in which 255 Britons and about 700 Argentines lost their lives, won back the islands. On June 14, Gen. <PERSON> Menendez </PERSON> surrendered his troops at <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stanley </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Galtieri </PERSON> was forced to step down in disgrace in June 1982 after the Falklands defeat. The government, controlled by the military since a March 1976 coup, returned to civilian rule the next year. <PERSON> Galtieri </PERSON>, 62, said <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> almost won the war, so charges of incompetence were baseless. Summing up his own defense on Oct. 17, <PERSON> Galtieri </PERSON> said: `` Would I do it again? Given the same circumstances and conditions, would I proceed in the same manner? The answer is, yes.'' Under Argentine law, federal appeals courts may increase or reduce sentences as well as uphold, overturn or impose convictions. They may even, despite their name, act as courts of first resort. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> has never formally declared a cessation of hostilities and diplomatic relations between the once-warm friends have never been resumed. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has substantially increased its military presence on the archipelago.

 Wearing a regal gown, former Philippine first lady <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was fingerprinted, photographed and ordered to remain here until she can come up with $ 5 million bail to face a racketeering trial. `` I'm not going to let the lady go back to the <LOCATION> Hawaiian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> until I'm certain the bail is set,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> said after Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> pleaded innocent at an arraignment Monday. Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, who lives in exile in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> with her husband, former <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, brushed away tears. <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> ordered her to return to court Thursday with her attorneys if the lawyers have not worked out a bail agreement with prosecutors by then. Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, 59, was then fingerprinted and had her mug shot taken by federal marshals before being released temporarily without bail. <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> instructed her not to leave the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> area. She blew a kiss to a crowd outside the federal courthouse before departing for her midtown <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> hotel. The Marcoses were indicted Oct. 21 on charges they plundered the Philippine treasury of $ 103 million, spirited the money out of their country and into foreign bank accounts, and used it to buy prime <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> real estate and art. Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' arrival at the courthouse for her arraignment was dramatic. A seven-car caravan, including two stretch limousines, pulled up to the courthouse. The waiting crowd was momentarily stunned when the former first lady stepped out of her limo. She wore a bright aquamarine, chiffon gown with traditional Filipino butterfly sleeves and pearl earrings. Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, who gained notoriety for the thousands of pairs of shoes found in the presidential palace after her husband's ouster in February 1986, wore simple black, high-heeled pumps `` She does n't look like she's going to court, she looks like she's going to a dance ball,'' said <PERSON> Ziyad </PERSON> <PERSON> Barq </PERSON>, a designer who stopped at the courthouse to see what all the fuss was about. At least a dozen protesters greeted Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and her entourage of at least a dozen people, chanting `` Justice, justice must prevail! Send the Marcoses to jail!'' A woman wearing a black cape and vampire fangs held up a sign reading, `` <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, bloodsucker of the Filipino people.'' Detractors' shouts drowned out those of supporters, who occasionally called out, `` We love you, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, clasping rosary beads, made her way up the courthouse steps through a gauntlet of hundreds of reporters and photographers. Inside, she spoke aloud only twice during the 45-minute hearing, once to waive a reading of the six-count indictment and once to answer `` not guilty'' when asked her plea. Most of the hearing, in a court packed with 200 artists, reporters and spectators, was taken up with lawyers arguing over the amount of bail. Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' attorneys originally wanted her released without any bond, but had agreed to a package in which the couple would put up $ 1.2 million in Philippine pesos and jewelry they brought to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> in 1986. But Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> LaBella </PERSON> balked, noting that the jewelry is subject to subpoena in a grand jury investigation and that the current <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> government has laid claim to the Marcoses' Philippine currency. `` There are conflicting claims to the property brought by the Marcoses to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' conceded the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' attorney, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartko </PERSON>. A federal judge in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> has frozen `` anything the Marcoses own anywhere in the world'' except for living expenses and legal fees, <PERSON> Bartko </PERSON> said. `` The Marcoses have been forced to live on borrowed funds,'' he said. `` All of their collateral is subject to claims.'' <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> suggested putting up the hillside home the Marcoses occupy in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Bartko </PERSON> said the home was owned by an offshore corporation controlled by a Marcos co-defendant. Also suggested and rejected were the Marcoses' Swiss bank accounts and a home in <LOCATION> Woodside </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> finally ordered bail secured by real estate, cash and personal possessions `` amounting to a reasonable market value of $ 5 million'' and gave the lawyers until Thursday to work out details <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> remained in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> lawyers claimed last week that he was too frail to make the 10-hour plane trip. <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> postponed <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' arraignment pending an examination by a government physician. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was examined Monday at <ORGANIZATION> Tripler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, and the results were to be sent to the judge and lawyers today, said Sgt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Shipp </PERSON>, a hospital spokesman.

 Five inmates took over a prison near the capital, wresting guns from their guards, taking three hostages and wounding two police officers, authorities said today. The takeover occurred late Monday at the penitentiary in <LOCATION> Quezaltepeque </LOCATION>, about 15 miles northeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Also in <LOCATION> Quezaltepeque </LOCATION> Monday night, suspected leftist rebels detonated bombs outside the offices of two political parties, officials said. `` The prisoners took the weapons of several prison guards and seized a nurse at the jail and two guards as hostages,'' a National Police officer said by telephone from the town. The inmates shot and wounded two <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> officers who tried to intervene, said the officer, who requested anonymity. The condition of the two officers was not immediately known. An armed forces spokesman said five prisoners jumped the guards and had taken over the prison. `` They're together with the rest of the prisoners, about 250 of them, but they have n't made any demands,'' the spokesman said on condition he not be identified. Army troops dispatched to the penitentiary `` are standing by and have not intervened to subdue the rioters,'' the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> officer said. Suspected guerrillas detonated two bombs outside the offices of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, the officer said. The explosions damaged the offices, but no one was hurt. Officials said they did not know if the explosions were related to the prison takeover. The guerrillas are pitted against the U.S.-backed government in a 9-year-old civil war. More than 65,000 people have died in the conflict, most of them civilians.

 <LOCATION> Walden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pond </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Thoreau </PERSON> retreated to observe nature 140 years ago, is to conservationism what <LOCATION> Selma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, is to civil rights or <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, to rock music. So the possibility that an office park and a housing project may rise within a few hundred yards of the pond has rallied the conservation movement. `` If you ca n't save the place where the principle was first asserted, how can you hope to assert the principle elsewhere?'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanding </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Thoreau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Country </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, asserted Monday. `` We've been getting calls about these projects from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Beyer </PERSON>, chairwoman of the <ORGANIZATION> Concord </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's no longer a matter just of <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION> making decisions about a few parcels. It's a symbol for the nation.'' <LOCATION> Walden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pond </LOCATION> is a 62-acre body of water in a 333-acre state-owned reservation on the edge of <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION>, an affluent town of 12,500 about 20 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Thoreau </PERSON>, a naturalist and writer, built a cabin on the pond in 1845 and remained there two years. The <ORGANIZATION> Concord </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to decide Thursday whether to allow the 139-unit housing project. Several local officials have come out in favor of the project, which is a compromise between the developers' original request for 251 units and a prior ruling by the zoning board that it would accept just 125. `` My feeling is that this is a reasonable compromise,'' said town Manager <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON>. To make the project more palatable, developers <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> DeNormandie </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Corcoran </PERSON> have agreed to set aside 41 of the units at prices of about $ 75,000 for people with low incomes. The rest of the 135 condos and four detached, single-family houses would sell at market rates _ probably around $ 250,000 each for the condos and $ 1 million or more for the houses, <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Blanding </PERSON> said the conservation alliance agrees that `` Concord badly needs affordable housing.'' But, he contended, the project is `` still too intrusive'' and should be scaled down further, or better yet, moved elsewhere. `` We recognize that <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION> is a living town. We do n't want to freeze it at some elite level. But we have to realize that we have one of the country's great cultural resources in the landscape here, and it's our obligation to protect it for future generations,'' he said. Plans for the office park are on hold while the developer, <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Properties </ORGANIZATION>, prepares an environmental notification form for state review. <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Properties </ORGANIZATION> is owned by publisher and real estate magnate <PERSON> Mortimer </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuckerman </PERSON>. He owns <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monthly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, which published <PERSON> Thoreau </PERSON>'s journals posthumously in the early 1900s. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Linde </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Properties </ORGANIZATION>, said he disputes conservationists' assertions that the project would negatively affect the woodlands. He said his firm considers the area `` a very desirable site.'' Last summer, in the face of erosion, littering and vandalism, the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> began limiting access to <LOCATION> Walden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pond </LOCATION>, closing the reservation whenever the 300-car parking lot became full. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinreb </PERSON>, the state's principal planner for the property, said <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' officials `` are concerned about the fact that, just as we're beginning to get a handle on the overuse, there are these construction projects on the edge of the reservation that are potentially a threat.'' However, he said, the state is not likely to jump into the fray. `` Our position has been that it is a battle that is more appropriately fought at the local level,'' <PERSON> Weinreb </PERSON> said. `` The question is, what is Concord all about? What kind of town does it want to be?''

 Salvadoran rebels say they are ready to renew talks with the U.S.-backed government to end their 9-year-old civil war, but will not surrender weapons as a precondition. `` We have given them the message that we are ready to talk with all social forces, including the army, that we are ready to talk at any place or time,'' said <PERSON> Leonel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, the umbrella organization for five Salvadoran guerrilla groups. `` The one that's established conditions is the government,'' he said Monday. `` -LRB- President -RRB- <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> has said that in order to talk again with the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> we have to put down our arms. This is absurd, it's inadmissible.'' <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> <PERSON> Damas </PERSON>, Roman Catholic archbishop of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, met with rebel leaders and presented a report on proposals for a negotiated end to the conflict that has claimed 65,000 lives. He said the report is based on observations from more than 60 Salvadoran organizations. Guerrilla representative <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Villalobos </PERSON> said the front considers the report positive because it demands `` an end to the war and the reasons that led to it.'' <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> <PERSON> Damas </PERSON> presented the report during a ceremony at a military installation attended by Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s military commander and de facto ruler. <PERSON> Villalobos </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said they briefed <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on visits by rebel representatives to <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> to promote a negotiated settlement. They said rebel officials would return to those countries to inform government leaders about their meeting with the archbishop. <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> <PERSON> Damas </PERSON> said the report contained ideas offered by the Salvadoran organizations in several days of meetings with church leaders, but he gave no details. Salvadoran church leaders have mediated the few meetings between the government and rebels, and frequently urge that talks resume. The last meeting was Oct. 20, 1987 in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Radio Venceremos, the clandestine rebel radio, said Monday that Salvadoran rebels had killed the mayor of a small town in <LOCATION> Morazan </LOCATION>, a western province in the war zone. The army said 53 rebels and 29 soldiers were killed in several skirmishes in October.

 <PERSON> Lise </PERSON> <PERSON> Dominique </PERSON> and <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON> dressed up as cows for a Halloween wedding and said, `` I moo.'' As the `` Monster Mash'' played Monday, `` the guests mooed us down the aisle and then they all applauded,'' <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON> said after the ceremony. `` It was very atraditional,'' the high school football coach said from the couple's home in this northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> city. <PERSON> Dominique </PERSON>, news director for radio station <ORGANIZATION> KEZR </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, originally ordered the cow costumes in August as a joke, not for a wedding. She waited and waited, but the costumes did n't arrive. Earlier this month, <PERSON> Dominique </PERSON> finally called the company and insisted she needed them right away because she planned to get married in them on Halloween. The company apologized and rushed the costumes to <PERSON> Dominique </PERSON> by air freight. All they asked in return were pictures of the cow vows. This presented <PERSON> Dominique </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON>, who have lived together for the past 10 years, with a problem: Should they go through with a wedding or admit to the company that they lied just to get the costumes? <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON> wanted to do the honorable thing. And <PERSON> Dominique </PERSON> accepted his proposal a week ago. `` We'd been living together for so long and we needed a nudge,'' said <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON>. After the vows, the estimated 35 family and friends gathered at the couple's home. `` We're eating pizza and drinking beer and telling lies and having fun,'' <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON> said.

 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is listing five areas in which it says <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> could respond constructively to a series of unilateral <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> measures aimed at easing tensions on the peninsula. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said Monday that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is relaxing some trade, travel and diplomatic restrictions against <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in support of efforts by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to promote greater stability in the area. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is looking for a `` positive, constructive response'' from the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION>. Specifically, he said, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is seeking signs of North Korean flexibility in the fledgling north-south dialogue and a willingness to provide more information on the thousands of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> servicemen still unaccounted for since the Korean War. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said at the end of the conflict there were 8,177 American soldiers listed as missing, although that figure also includes servicemen whose remains were recovered by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military but for whom positive identification was not possible. A year ago, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> said it had uncovered the remains of five <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen. The spokesman said <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> also could show good faith by `` eliminating vicious anti-American propaganda,'' by cooperating in confidence-building measures in the demilitarized zone and by ending its alleged support for international terrorism. He said any discussion of the withdrawal of the 40,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops stationed in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> would be premature. The South Korean government today welcomed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> statement, saying it hoped the moves would promote dialogue between the two Koreas. `` We hope that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> moves would help promote dialouge on the peninsula and stimulate <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to come out as a responsible member of the international community,'' said <PERSON> Shin </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-young </PERSON>, director-general of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> have had a record of almost uninterrupted hostility since the Korean armistice was signed 35 years ago, and the steps announced Monday appear to represent the most ambitious effort to date to achieve a more harmonious relationship. The warfare claimed the lives of more than 33,000 American servicemen. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will encourage unofficial, non-governmental visits from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in academics, sports, culture and other areas. He said financial regulations are being revised to permit group travel by Americans on a case-by-case basis to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. In addition, American diplomats will be allowed substantive contact with North Korean diplomats for the first time in almost a year. Commercial exports of humanitarian goods to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> will be allowed on a limited basis. Currently, humanitarian items must be donated. South Korean President <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae </PERSON> <PERSON> Woo </PERSON> has announced a series of initiatives aimed at easing tensions on the peninsula, including a call for a north-south summit meeting and for two-way trade. On Oct. 20, he met with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and asked for conciliatory measures toward the north to complement the ones he has taken. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have been advised of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy switch and have been asked to convey the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> position to North Korean authorities.

 A federal judge sentenced a self-described white supremacist to two years in prison and ordered him to pay $ 100 for threatening former presidential candidate <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s life last spring <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Filippine </PERSON> on Monday handed <PERSON> Londell </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> the maximum prison term under federal sentencing guidelines for threatening to kill the black Democratic candidate and possessing an unregistered automatic rifle. <PERSON> Filippine </PERSON> also ordered that the 30-year-old man be supervised for three years following his release. Under the guidelines, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> could have been fined $ 30,000, but <PERSON> Filippine </PERSON> ordered him to pay only $ 100. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> made no comment on the sentence. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, and his wife, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON>, were arrested May 13 at their apartment in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, 50 miles west of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. An informant had led authorities to woods where the rifle, a loaded .223 - caliber Colt AR-15, was Investigators also secretly recorded a conversation in which <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> told the informant that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would be killed because he was `` trying to make a fool out of us white people.'' After his arrest, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> told reporters that he grew up with `` prejudices against anything that is n't white.'' The Williamses originally pleaded innocent to all charges but later made plea bargains. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> pleaded guilty Aug. 4 to two of the four charges against him, and about a month later his wife pleaded guilty to one of three charges against her, possession of an unregistered automatic weapon. In exchange for the pleas, the government dropped charges of intimidating and threatening a witness. Mrs. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> is scheduled to be sentenced Friday.

 A hemophiliac has been awarded $ 1.6 million by a federal jury in a lawsuit in which he said he contracted AIDS from a blood-based drug. <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, 35, sued <ORGANIZATION> Miles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Elkhart </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, maker of <LOCATION> Koate </LOCATION>, a blood-based clotting product he took to control bleeding after minor surgery in October 1983. In a similar case in south <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> earlier this year, a jury ruled in favor of <ORGANIZATION> Miles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> was diagnosed in 1985 as infected with the AIDS virus, and two years later, doctors told him he had developed acquired immune deficiency syndrome. In his lawsuit, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> contended that the product he took had been contaminated with the AIDS virus from an unemployed <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> man who, on 40 occasions between November 1982 and September 1983, sold plasma to a center in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, which supplied Miles. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> man died of AIDS less than six weeks after his last plasma sale. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury on Wednesday awarded <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> $ 1.1 million and his wife, $ 500,000. `` This was a tragic thing,'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Connell </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' attorney, said Monday `` A man about 30 years old, just got married, in the prime of life ... and he gets struck down like this.'' According to the national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>, almost 800 cases of AIDS have been attributed to blood products such as that taken by <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. Since early 1985, special heat treatment has been performed on clotting products to kill any AIDS virus contamination. But many hemophilia patients were infected before those precautions were used, according to researchers. The Jones award was `` adequate ... in light of the disease,'' <PERSON> Connell </PERSON> said. However, <PERSON> Miles </PERSON> denied <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' claim of negligence on the company's part. `` We feel strongly that the verdict in the case is not supported by the facts,'' said <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> Modersbach </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, counsel for <ORGANIZATION> Cutter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Biologicals </ORGANIZATION>, the Miles division that manufactures <PERSON> Koate </PERSON>. The company intends to appeal, he said. Miles will ask <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Orinda </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> for a judgment overturning the verdict and, failing that, will seek a new trial, <PERSON> Modersbach </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Poachers Kill Off Kenya's White Rhino Herd, But Not Without A

<TEXT>
 Park rangers shot it out with poachers who gunned down at least five white rhinoceroses and made off with the animals' valuable horns, killing off the species in <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s public lands, authorities said. A newspaper reported today that two rangers were seriously wounded in the battle Sunday night with about 30 poachers at Meru National Park, 140 miles northeast of the capital <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION>. The poachers escaped after hacking off the rhinos' horns, which can sell for up to $ 24,000 each in the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, where they are used to make traditional medicines. In the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, the horns are fashioned into ornamental dagger handles. `` People watched over them day and night,'' a Kenyan wildlife source said of the rhinos. `` The rangers were wounded trying to defend them.'' According to today's English-language newspaper The Standard, two rangers were seriously injured in what it described as a 45 minute attack. Five rhinos were killed, said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhoho </PERSON>, minister of tourism and wildlife. Several wildlife experts, who spoke on condition of anonymity, put the number at six. Thirteen elephants also were gunned down in the last week in different areas, the wildlife sources said. The killings came despite increased anti-poaching efforts by the government since August, when <PERSON> Muhoho </PERSON> revealed the slaughter of 92 elephants in the previous three months and the government launched a highly publicized campaign to stop the killing. The white rhinos, which unlike the black rhino are not indigenous to <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, were imported from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> about 20 years ago to start a colony and lived under guard in a special reserve in the park. There still are an estimated 30 to 40 white rhino on private ranches in <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>. The white rhino's numbers have not been reduced as sharply as have those of the black rhino, which were thought to number more than 60,000 in the early 1970s. Today the black rhino, numbering about 800 throughout <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, is considered an endangered species. Most of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s white rhinos live in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, where experts estimate the herd at about 3,000 strong. Twenty-five to 30 of the animals live in a private park in <ORGANIZATION> Solio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ranch </ORGANIZATION>, near the equator southeast of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nation </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. Both types of rhino are a rather dark gray, with their visible differences lying mostly in horn size and lip shape. The white rhino's horn is longer. <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> sent a paramilitary unit to Meru National Park to track the rhinos' poachers, said a government wildlife source. He declined to provide details. Gunmen in the last week slaughtered and hacked the tusks off five elephants in southeastern <LOCATION> Tsavo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> and eight elephants in the arid <LOCATION> Mathews </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Range </LOCATION> 155 miles north of <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION>, the sources said. Their deaths bring to about 150 the number killed since April, according to published data. Wildlife officials estimate the toll is much higher. Studies by the Nairobi-based <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Environmental Program show that in the past 15 years, <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s elephant population has dropped 85 percent. An aerial survey in February of <LOCATION> Tsavo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> and its environs found fewer than 5,500 elephants, down from 35,000 in 1974. Experts blame the intensifed slaughter on an all-time high of ivory prices, which have climbed steadily since the early 1970s and average about $ 82 per pound.

 <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest retailer, is selling the world's largest building and a real estate unit, shuffling jobs and buying its stock in a move seen by some as a defense against a possible takeover. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, chairman of the 102-year-old company, said the plan is designed to enhance stock value and put its resources on consumer-oriented businesses _ retailing, insurance, real estate and financial services. <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said the timing of the announcement may have been affected by the recent wave of takeovers. `` <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> has not been untouched by the rumor and speculation that thrives in these conditions,'' he said. `` But make no mistake,'' he added, `` this strategy is not solely a reaction to that environment.'' The announcement was greeted wearily on Wall Street, as <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> stock slid $ 1.875 Monday to close at $ 41.75 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. `` The market's perception seems to be that they labored mightily and brought forth a mouse,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a retail analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> had been expected to take some action to improve the value of its stock after announcing last week that third-quarter profits fell 16 percent _ the third consecutive period <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' income has declined. Net income for the quarter was $ 344.2 million, or 90 cents per share, for the three months that ended Sept. 30, compared with $ 409 million, or $ 1.08 a share, for third-quarter 1987. `` This makes a takeover more difficult in the near term. It does n't make it impossible,'' said <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenstein </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` This will satisfy the pressure -LRB- on <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- for the short term.'' The Sears Tower, a stunning black skyscraper that rises 110 stories _ 1,450 feet _ from the downtown Loop business district, was built in 1974 and has been valued at $ 1.8 billion. Besides selling the building, <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> said it would: _ Buy back 10 percent of its stock. _ Sell the commercial real estate division of its <ORGANIZATION> Coldwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Real </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a move that analyst <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loeb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said would raise $ 500 million. _ Continue to trim jobs from retail support activities like stockrooms and distribution centers and add people to the sales force. `` Overall, there will be job reductions,'' said <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, whose company employs 526,000 worldwide. _ Adopt `` everyday low pricing'' at its 825 retail stores, instead of sales. _ Take a one-time, after-tax charge of $ 425 million in the fourth quarter to cover expenses for new merchandise assortments, liquidation of old merchandise and other organizational changes. `` In terms of merchandising, they did what they had to do _ go head-to-head with the K marts and other companies who have taken market share from them,'' <PERSON> Greenstein </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Loeb </PERSON> said: `` I think the consumer is n't going to jump on the bandwagon as quickly as <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> would like. The consumer expecting the flyer is n't going to get it anymore.''

<TEXT>
 Perhaps mystery writer <PERSON> Dashiell </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammett </PERSON> was dropping a clue to would-be-bad-writers when he wrote, `` The cheaper the crook, the gaudier the patter.'' More than 100 writers accepted the challenge and submitted entries in the `` Hamming up <PERSON> Hammett </PERSON>'' writing contest, vying for the grand prize package: a bottle of cheap gin, a ham sandwich and hard-boiled egg. The winners got what they had coming Monday at <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s Grill, a swank little joint where <PERSON> Hammett </PERSON> used to bend an elbow between chapters of books like `` The Maltese Falcon'' and `` The Thin Man.'' Top honors, or dishonors, were shared by <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Killian </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlach </PERSON>. <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Diamond </PERSON> got a bottle of cheap wine as a runner-up. All three writers are from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, although the judges did n't know that while poring over essays from around the country. <PERSON> Vlach </PERSON> was picked for his classic Hammett-esque prose: `` She turned to me, the <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cop </ORGANIZATION>, and said with a tear dribbling through her eye liner like <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> parting the <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, ` You wo n't turn me in. I love you. You love me.' `` I counted the lies in those three sentences, multiplied by three, then opened the door for her pal, <PERSON> Little </PERSON> <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Egypt </PERSON>. ... When the cops got there I turned them both in. Her because she said she loved me. Him because he called me <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Dick </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Killian </PERSON>'s entry was honored for an obscure pun from `` The Thin Man''. `` ` Tell me the truth,'' <PERSON> Nora </PERSON> said, `` when you were on the floor, wrestling with <PERSON> Mimi </PERSON>, did you have anorexia.'' When `` The Thin Man'' was published in 1934, censors deleted a similar line. <PERSON> Nora </PERSON> actually asked <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> if he had `` an erection'' when he wrestled with <PERSON> Mimi </PERSON>. Diamond's entry featured a hard-boiled detective named <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> meeting an operative named <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> at the corner of Fifth and Market, where <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> had found a body: `` <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> bends over and with a heave rolls over a huge concrete slab. Laying there is a body with a face one could never forget. It was <PERSON> Hoffa </PERSON>. ... We put the slab back and left ol' <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> there at that intersection. He's lying there now looking up at those society dames as they go by. I figure <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> would have liked it that way.'' There were lots of other no-so-good entries reviewed, and the judges _ private eye <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Lipset </PERSON>, novelist <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gores </PERSON> and local <PERSON> Hammett </PERSON> expert <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Herron </PERSON> _ said there was little difference between the winners and many of the losers. <PERSON> Killian </PERSON> seemed to agree. `` I'm pretty disappointed,'' he griped. `` All I got was a bottle of cheap gin and a moldy old ham sandwich.'' He apparently forgot about the egg, and the free publicity.

 A woman was sentenced to five years in prison for her role in the $ 7 million Wells Fargo robbery, but was spared a $ 10,000 fine for plotting to spend some of the stolen cash to pay for a toy giveaway. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Emmet </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarie </PERSON> sentenced <PERSON> Luz </PERSON> <PERSON> Berrios </PERSON> <PERSON> Berrios </PERSON>, a 38-year-old occupational therapist, on Monday. `` We hoped for more, but it did n't surprise us,'' defense attorney <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wieselman </PERSON> said. Federal prosecutors declined to comment on the sentence. <PERSON> Berrios </PERSON> pleaded guilty in September to a charge of conspiracy to transport stolen money. The loot was taken from a <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> depot in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> in September 1983. Authorities say it was the nation's second-largest cash heist. <PERSON> Berrios </PERSON> admitted to conspiring with others in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> to send $ 5,000 to $ 12,000 to <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> to pay for toys given away on Jan. 6, 1985, the day some <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> countries traditionally exchange gifts. She said she presumed the money was stolen from <LOCATION> Wells </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION>. The government contends that <PERSON> Berrios </PERSON> is a leader of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Macheteros </LOCATION>, a terrorist group seeking Puerto Rican independence. The group has claimed a role in attacks on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> installations in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. The government contends the <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> heist was masterminded by <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Macheteros </LOCATION> and carried out by a <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> security guard who has never been captured. According to a pre-sentencing report by authorities, <PERSON> Berrios </PERSON> was the Macheteros payroll from September 1980 until May 1985, and was paid $ 500 a month. <PERSON> Berrios </PERSON>' husband, <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Segarra </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, and four other men charged in the robbery are on trial before <PERSON> Clarie </PERSON>. Nine others are awaiting trial, and one other defendant has pleaded guilty.

<DATELINE>VALLETTA, Malta (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Palestinian who was the only hijacker to survive the 1985 commandeering of an Egyptian airliner pleaded guilty today to killing two women passengers, an American and an Israeli. Sixty people died in the hijacking and the storming of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 by <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> soldiers, who attacked with gunfire and high-powered explosives. It was the highest death toll ever for a hijacking. The Lebanese-born defendant, <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Rezaq </PERSON>, 25, was the only survivor among three Palestinian gunmen who commandeered the Egyptair plane, which was flying the <LOCATION> Athens-Cairo </LOCATION> route Nov. 23, 1985. In a courtroom in a heavily guarded fort, <PERSON> Rezaq </PERSON> pleaded guilty to seven of nine charges including the killings of <PERSON> Scarlet </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogenkamp </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Oceanside </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and of <PERSON> Nitzan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendelson </PERSON>. The two were shot and thrown onto the tarmac after Jewish and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> passengers were singled out. If convicted of the murder and hijacking charges, <PERSON> Rezaq </PERSON> could be sentenced to life imprisonment, <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>'s stiffest criminal penalty. Prosecutor <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaetano </PERSON>, speaking during a break, said the state might drop the two remaining lesser charges of firearms use and violation of Maltese airspace, in order to end the trial quickly. The storming of the plane, in which 56 of the 60 victims died, raised questions about whether too much force was used by the Egyptians. Most of the victims died from smoke inhalation during a fire sparked by an explosion, which a Maltese investigation said appeared to come after a hijacker tossed a grenade at the Egyptian soldiers. Two of the other victims were killed by gunfire from the Egyptians, investigators found.

 Gov. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>, who once said reporters and friends call her `` Mother,'' had some motherly advice for business and civic leaders: drink milk, eat cookies and `` take a nap every afternoon.'' The speech was intended for delivery to an <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Town </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> meeting but was n't because Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> was suffering laryngitis. However, press aides released a copy of the text Monday. `` I would like to offer you one more piece of advice,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> said in the speech after discussing the rising cost of litigation and possible alternatives to court rooms. `` Think about it carefully as you deliberate these next few days. `` This advice is a small essay called ` Everything I Ever Needed To Know I Learned In Kindergarten.''' `` There are the things I learned: `` _ Play fair `` _ Share everything `` _ Do n't hit people `` _ Put things back where you found them `` _ Clean up your mess `` _ Do n't take things that are n't yours `` _ Say you're sorry when you hurt somebody `` _ Wash your hands before you eat `` _ Flush `` _ Warm cookies and cold milk are good for you `` _ Live a balanced life `` _ Learn some and think some and draw and paint and sing and dance `` _ And play and work every day some `` _ Take a nap every afternoon. `` _ When you get out in the world, watch for traffic, hold hands and stick together. `` Think of what a better world it would be if we all, the whole world, ate cookies and milk every afternoon and lay down with our blankets for a nap. `` Or if we had a basic policy in our nation and other nations to always put things back where we found them and cleaned up our own messes. `` And it is still true no matter how old you are _ when you go out in the world it is best to hold hands and stick together.'' Mofford press secretary <PERSON> Vada </PERSON> <PERSON> Manager </PERSON> said the passage was `` a story that she picked up in her numerous travels'' and seemed appropriate for the speech. The essay is by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Fulghum </PERSON> and is part of his book `` All I Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten,'' being published this fall by <ORGANIZATION> Random </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. `` It was kind of a humorous end to what was otherwise serious and substantive stuff,'' Manager said. The <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Town </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> is a periodic gathering of civic, governmental, academic and business leaders that focuses on a different issue each session. The 53rd Town Hall, meeting at the Grand Canyon, was focused on `` civil justice in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>.'' The Democratic governor, who succeeded Republican <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> upon his impeachment conviction in April, raised several cost-cutting alternatives such as arbitration, mediation and selection by the court of neutral expert witnesses. But she said it was not for her to recommend any specifics.

 Several jurors gasped as a neurologist testified that <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, on trial for murder in the death of his illegally adopted daughter, grinned when told the 6-year-old girl was permanently brain damaged. Dr. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilhenny </PERSON> testified Monday that he met with <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> after neurological tests conducted on the comatose <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> were completed. `` I told him -LRB- her condition -RRB- was quite grave, and that she had suffered permanent brain damage, but that she would survive,'' <PERSON> Kilhenny </PERSON> said, adding that <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> responded, `` ` What you're saying is that she's not going to be an Olympic athlete.' He said <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> had `` a big grin. It was, I thought, inappropriate.'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> glared at the doctor during his testimony, while the dead girl's biological mother, <PERSON> Michele </PERSON> <PERSON> Launders </PERSON>, listened from the front row. <PERSON> Kilhenny </PERSON> and <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> talked in the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vincent </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> emergency room on the morning of Nov. 2, 1987, when <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> arrived unconscious. She died three days later after being officially declared brain dead. <PERSON> Kilhenny </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> had died from blunt head trauma, which the prosecution contends was inflicted by <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>. He said there was no medical evidence that the girl choked to death, as <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> contends. Under questioning by defense attorney <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> London </PERSON>, he conceded that <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'s symptoms _ vomiting, liver malfunction, and unconsciousness _ were similar to those of <PERSON> Reye </PERSON>'s syndrome, a rare viral illness that afflicts children. But the doctor said that <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'s autopsy did not reveal the presence of a virus. Earlier, the defense attorney attacked the credibility of nurse <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodenhoff </PERSON> after she admitted disliking <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> because of his cool, unemotional response to the statement that <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> was probably brain-dead. Ms. <PERSON> Dodenhoff </PERSON> said she formed a dislike for <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> in the emergency room because he did not react the way she thought he should to the grave diagnosis. She said he seemed to show little concern about the child. Ms. <PERSON> Dodenhoff </PERSON>, 26, testified last week that when she told <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> the condition of <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>, he asked, `` Have you found anything else wrong with her?'' `` It upset me, his response to the statement,'' Ms. <PERSON> Dodenhoff </PERSON> said Monday. `` I thought it was inappropriate.'' Under a tense cross-examination during which <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothwax </PERSON> were shouting at each other, the nurse denied her feelings about <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> influenced her testimony. The judge interrupted <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> several times to ask questions. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> objected vigorously, yelling, `` This is my cross-examination!'' <PERSON> Rothwax </PERSON> slammed down his gavel and replied that he would interrupt to clarify matters whenever he deemed it necessary. Even though Ms. <PERSON> Dodenhoff </PERSON> admitted she wanted to see <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s reaction when she said the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> would be notified, she denied she was trying to provoke a reaction

 Federal officials suspected for years that radioactive wastes from the Fernald uranium processing plant might be contaminating ground water, but they were indifferent to the threat, a watchdog group says. The government received the information through a 1960 engineer's report to <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lead </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, the contractor that operated the plant from the early 1950s through late 1985, said the Government Accountability Project. The Washington-based organization cited documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. `` It was disgusting. These documents indicate there were problems with these pits, that clay sides were slipping down, that there were cracks in the pits, and materials were leaking into the groundwater,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON>, staff lawyer for the group. Nearly 13 million pounds of uranium-containing waste have been dumped into six waste pits since the plant opened in 1951, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. Thorium and other radioactive toxic wastes in the pits threaten water supplies, said the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>. The plant, located 18 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Fernald </LOCATION>, is over the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> aquifer that provides water for some southwestern <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> communities and businesses. The pits were placed in unsuitable wet areas despite warnings from government geologists and other scientists about danger to the environment, <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON> said. `` The prime motivation at the Fernald plant and other Department of Energy sites was production, and the environment either played no role at all in decisions, or at best a backup role,'' he said. The documents were internal memoranda from August 1960 written to National Lead of hio by <PERSON> J.D </PERSON>. Eye, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> engineer, the <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday. In the memo, <PERSON> Eye </PERSON> said there was no assurance clay seals in the pits were still watertight. He also informed the company of damage to one pit, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. National Lead of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> faces a $ 300 million class-action lawsuit filed by <PERSON> Fernald </PERSON> plant neighbors in 1985 alleging that radioactive materials from the plant have contaminated the environment, threatened residents' health and ruined property values. The Energy Department, the Fernald plant's owner, said in documents filed recently in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court that government officials instructed National Lead of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> managers to ignore environmental problems and push ahead with production. The agency is defending the National Lead of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> in the lawsuit. A department spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> declined to comment further Monday. <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> has also sued, accusing the department of polluting air and water at the <LOCATION> Fernald </LOCATION> plant's 1,050-acre site. The state and the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> have been negotiating in an attempt to settle the dispute.

<HEAD>Soviet Union Has Run Budget Deficits for Past 10 Years</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Finance Minister <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Gostev </PERSON> said today that the Soviet national budget has been in the red for the past decade, and that the deficit was `` critically large'' in the mid-1980s before beginning to drop. <PERSON> Gostev </PERSON>'s revelation at a news conference came just days after the Supreme Soviet passed a 494 billion ruble -LRB- $ 795 billion -RRB- 1989 budget with a 34 billion ruble -LRB- $ 55 billion -RRB- deficit. In presenting that budget, <PERSON> Gostev </PERSON> acknowledged for the first time that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had a budget deficit. `` I'd say it's been in existence for about 10 years. It was extremely large, critically large, in the last years of the previous five-year plan period,'' <PERSON> Gostev </PERSON> told reporters. He said the deficit then was 37 billion rubles -LRB- $ 59 billion -RRB-. `` For the first time we have clearly stated that a deficit exists,'' <PERSON> Gostev </PERSON> said. `` We can not live with a budget deficit. So we'll try to get rid of it during the year.'' He said economic managers would try to trim $ 40 billion from the budget, cut down on administration and get money-losing state businesses, 24,000 of which are bankrupt, to turn a profit. Western analysts said Monday they think the Soviet budget deficit is larger than officials have said, and may threaten Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms. <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanous </PERSON>, who develops models of the Soviet economy for the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> firm <ORGANIZATION> PlanEcon </ORGANIZATION>, estimated the deficit at 65 billion rubles to 75 billion rubles -LRB- $ 104 billion to $ 120 billion -RRB- each in 1987 and 1988. <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Maslyukov </PERSON>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and an alternate member of the ruling Politburo, told the news conference that the Soviet economy has inflation of 0.9 percent to 1.5 percent. <PERSON> Maslyukov </PERSON> said wages have risen faster than labor productivity. `` We have more money than we have goods. That's why the shelves in the stores are empty,'' he said. Some economic analysts say cheap consumer goods are hard to find in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> because of the system of setting prices. Since producers are not free to raise prices gradually on their goods, they stop manufacturing them and replace them with more expensive products on which they can make a profit. Showing a profit has become increasingly important as <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> pushes reforms requiring local managers to account for profits and losses. But <PERSON> Maslyukov </PERSON> said officials were not considering eliminating government control over prices. `` If we want to maintain the low level of prices we must ensure state control. Otherwise, we are not ready for the anarchy of the market. Competition in the internal economy will be required. The basis for that is not yet ready,'' <PERSON> Maslyukov </PERSON> said.

 A dormitory housemother who opened the door to an alleged victim of wife-beating should not have been fired despite her employer's rule barring unauthorized visitors, her lawyer said. <PERSON> Sallyanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said she lost her part-time job at a dormitory for <ORGANIZATION> Northeastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>'s women nursing students after she opened the dormitory door late one night last December to a woman who was crying and saying that she had been beaten by her husband and needed the police. Officials at <ORGANIZATION> Northeastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> said Mrs. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> was fired for violating rules that prohibited her from doing anything that might endanger the safety of the dormitory residents, including allowing unauthorized visitors after curfew. Mrs. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> is seeking unspecified damages and back pay from the hospital in a civil lawsuit argued Monday in Common Pleas Court. Both sides completed their arguments in the first day of trial, but Common Pleas Judge <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Prattis </PERSON> gave Mrs. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Chomsky </PERSON>, until Nov. 30 to cite similar cases. During the hearing, <PERSON> Prattis </PERSON> said there was no question that public policy encourages giving assistance to victims of abuse, but said that does not mean that it can be used as an exception to every rule established by employers. When Mrs. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> was on the stand, <PERSON> Prattis </PERSON> asked her if she would have let in a teen-age boy who came to the door with bruises and said he was abused. Mrs. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said she would, to which <PERSON> Prattis </PERSON> replied, `` I believe you would.'' `` And that, Ms. <PERSON> Chomsky </PERSON>, is your problem,'' the judge said to Mrs. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s lawyer. Mrs. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> also testified that a hospital security guard who was present on Dec. 13, 1987, when she let the woman in, told her to let the woman in and stayed until police came for the woman. However, the guard, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> DeMasi </PERSON>, who no longer works for the hospital, testified that he told Mrs. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> not to let the woman in the dorm. The woman did not testify and was not identified during the hearing. Dr. <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Hickman </PERSON>, the director of nursing education at the hospital, testified that Mrs. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> would have been disciplined regardless of whether a security guard was present, or whether the woman had been seeking assistance. Hospital rules, she said, prohibited any unauthorized people, regardless of their condition, from entering the building after curfew. Ms. <PERSON> Hickman </PERSON> also contended that when Mrs. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> first related her actions to hospital officials, she did not say the woman had claimed she had been abused.

 Trick-or-treaters traipsed through a <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> zoo and costumed marchers frolicked in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> parade, but <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>' traditional Halloween street party turned into a late-night melee. Revelers broke windows and looted stores after police closed <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION> on Monday night to an estimated 100,000 people cruising up and down the packed street, authorities said today. `` We're trying to take the streets back,'' Officer <PERSON> Fritz </PERSON> <PERSON> McDowell </PERSON> said around midnight, about midway through the four-hour melee during which rocks and bottles were thrown. About 150 officers, including some in riot gear and others on horseback, were summoned to quell the disturbance that quickly spread across a 10-block area. At least 10 businesses were vandalized. Twenty-three people among the estimated 200 who took part in the melee were arrested on a variety of misdemeanor and felony charges, said police Sgt. <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Whittington </PERSON>. There was no indication how many revelers may have been hurt. Three police officers were injured, but none required hospitalization, authorities said. Elsewhere, about 2,500 people attended a non-alcoholic Halloween party at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Field </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION> while about 20,000 others roamed a city street, site of the traditional bash. The 20,000 were there despite the fact that the State Street party, which has drawn an up to 100,000 in past Halloweens, was canceled this year because of costs, the need for liability insurance and the 21-year-old drinking age. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, a group of magicians gathered Monday at the grave of magician <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Houdini </PERSON> for the 62nd Halloween since <PERSON> Houdini </PERSON>'s death on Oct. 31, 1926 At 1:26 p.m. _ when <PERSON> Houdini </PERSON> died _ a magic wand was snapped in two. But <PERSON> Houdini </PERSON> once again failed to keep his promise to communicate from beyond the grave. Later in the day, <PERSON> Batman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cher </PERSON>, and scores of other costumed characters marched through the streets in the city's annual <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> Halloween Parade. `` This is <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s answer to the <LOCATION> Mardi </LOCATION> Gras,'' said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Raetz </PERSON>, who came in from <LOCATION> Ridgewood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, with his family to watch the festivities. About 250,000 people turned out for the event, police estimated. Among the marchers was a young woman dressed as <ORGANIZATION> Miss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shore </ORGANIZATION>, who wore a huge syringe that appeared to pierce her head in `` tribute'' to the medical waste that closed <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> beaches last summer. That <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> staple, Chinese takeout food, was portrayed by a group who appeared as a box of rice, soy sauce, a fortune cookie and a tea bag. Monday was the final day of a four-day `` Halloween Spooktacular'' at the Riverside Zoo in <LOCATION> Scottsbluff </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb </LOCATION>. The zoo was decorated with more than 700 pumpkins, and trick-or-treat stands handed out candy donated by merchants. `` It's unbelievable,'' said <PERSON> Trudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Scottsbluff </LOCATION>, who toured the zoo with her husband, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON>, and their two children. In <LOCATION> Saddle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, more than 800 costumed children and their parents posed for photos and shook hands with former President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> at what has become a Halloween neighborhood ritual. Crowds bantered and exchanged gifts with <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> for three hours outside his house in <LOCATION> Saddle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, where he has lived since 1981. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, 75, complimented children on their costumes and passed out more than 700 cards he had personally autographed Monday afternoon. `` Fortunately, I have a short name,'' he said. His grandson, <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, 9, stood by to count the guests. <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> played hostess in <LOCATION> Bel-Air </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, to a celebrity holiday bash in honor of the late Truman Capote. Capote died in Ms. <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>'s home in August 1984. She said she promised the author that she would one day throw a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> version of his famous annual masked ball at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Plaza Hotel. In <LOCATION> Saratoga </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lise </PERSON> <PERSON> Dominique </PERSON> and <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON> dressed up as cows for a Halloween wedding and said, `` I moo.'' <PERSON> Dominique </PERSON> originally ordered the cow costumes in August as a joke, not for a wedding. The costumes did n't arrive and last month <PERSON> Dominique </PERSON> called the company and insisted she needed them right away because she planned to get married in them on Halloween. The company apologized and rushed the costumes to <PERSON> Dominique </PERSON> by air freight. All they asked in return were pictures of the cow vows. <PERSON> Dominique </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON>, who have lived together for the past 10 years, decided to go through with a wedding rather than admit they'd lied to the company. `` We'd been living together for so long and we needed a nudge,'' said <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON>.

 Half a century after they ended a teen-age courtship and went their separate ways, love blossomed again for <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hallam </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mavis </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hallam </PERSON>, 71, married his childhood sweetheart 52 years after losing touch with her at the age of 18. In the intervening years, they both married and were widowed. Three months ago, <PERSON> Hallam </PERSON> tracked down <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, 69, at her home in <LOCATION> Nottingham </LOCATION>, just two miles from his home in <LOCATION> Kimberley </LOCATION>. `` It took me a long time to find her because I did n't know her married name,'' he said after Monday's wedding. `` When I did get her number it took me two days to pluck up the courage to ring.'' His wife said she was `` overawed when he rang, and met him the same day.'' She added: `` We had just drifted apart all those years ago, but we found we still got on well together and it snowballed from there.''

<HEAD>Polluted Venice Cracks Down On Detergent Use</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VENICE, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> today enforced a law banning the sale and use of detergents with high amounts of phosphorus that have been blamed in part for the severe pollution of the lagoon, the <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. About 2,000 tons of phosphorus from industrial, agricultural and residential use pour into the waters surrounding the city, spurring the growth of algae, according to Deputy Mayor <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Carbone </PERSON>. The algae die when they use up the sparse oxygen supply, leaving behind a nauseating smell and green slime. The new ordinance, which <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION> said was the first of its kind in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, bans detergents with a phosphorus content of more than 1 percent. City officials will conduct spot checks of stores to see if such detergents are being sold. Violators may face arrest and a three-month jail term. Mayor <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Casellati </PERSON> called the action `` only the first step in the battle against pollution, but it is a necessary step in order to avoid aggravating the environmental situation.'' In July, the Italian government allocated $ 2.2 million to help <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> fight the algae in its canals, which serve as sewers as well as thoroughfares in this boat-dependent city.

<HEAD>Prosecutor Files $800 Million Against Brawley and Advisers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A white county prosecutor who was cleared by a grand jury of accusations that he attacked a black teen-ager filed an $ 800 million defamation lawsuit against the girl and her advisers. Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Pagones </PERSON> said last month that he would sue the Rev. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> and lawyers <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alton </PERSON> <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> for their `` blatant, disgusting and deplorable lies.'' He filed the lawsuit Monday in a state court. The three men repeatedly claimed that <PERSON> Pagones </PERSON> was involved in the alleged abduction and rape of <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> by six white men last November. Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>, who never cooperated with the grand jury during its seven-month investigation, was found near her former apartment in <LOCATION> Wappingers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> last Nov. 28, smeared with dog feces and with racial slurs written on her body. The grand jury cleared <PERSON> Pagones </PERSON> of any involvement in the <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> case and concluded that the girl, now 16, fabricated the story. Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>, who has moved from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> with her family, and her advisers denounced that report as the product of a racist legal system. The 75-page lawsuit claims that Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> also defamed <PERSON> Pagones </PERSON> by saying that she supported all the actions of her lawyers and <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> said Monday that Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> would tell her story in court and, along with other witnesses, would prove <PERSON> Pagones </PERSON>' involvement <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> had no comment on the lawsuit, according to a receptionist at his law office. <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> did not return telephone calls for comment.

<HEAD>China's Population Growing Faster Than Planned</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s population could reach 1.27 billion by the year 2000 _ 70 million more than the current target, the nation's top family planning official said. State Family Commission Minister <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> <PERSON> Peiyun </PERSON> said the goal of holding the number of people in the world's most populous nation to 1.2 billion at the turn of the century no longer seems realistic, the official <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> reported today. <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> is the highest-ranking official to acknowledge that the target set in the 1980s will not be achieved, although other Chinese demographers have estimated the population in the year 2000 will be between 1.25 and 1.28 billion. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> now has about 1.08 billion people. Since the beginning of this decade, family planners have tried to curb population growth by advocating that each family have only one child and promoting the use of contraceptives and abortion. The natural growth rate reached a low of 1.1 percent in 1985 but climbed to 1.4 percent in 1986 and 1.6 percent last year, a result of rural opposition to the one-child policy and a second-generation baby boom as people born in a population surge in the early 1960s begin raising families. <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> said that although 78 percent of all couples use contraceptives, only 18 percent _ 32.3 million couples _ say they want only one child. She said more than half of families have two or more children and rural couples whose first child is a girl now are allowed to have a second baby. Ethnic minorities, which make up about 6 percent of the population, also are permitted two or more children. The government has made a concession for peasant families whose first baby is a girl because of the strong desire for boys to help work the land and carry on the family name. Newly affluent farmers frequently pay large fines for having two or more children until they produce a male heir. <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> said the government will not use force to carry out its family planning policy.

<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s foreign ministers met today in the first joint session of their stalled U.N.-mediated peace talks since early last month. The session, led by <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, was only the sixth direct meeting between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> since the talks began Aug. 25. No details of the talks were immediately reported. The negotiations aim at a lasting settlement, with priority given to consolidating the cease-fire which took effect Aug. 20 after eight years of fighting that claimed an estimated 1.5 million dead and wounded. Previous talks were held in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The third round began Monday when <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> met separately with <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> and <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON>. Talks have bogged down over the definition of the common border, specifically in the <LOCATION> Shatt-al-Arab </LOCATION>, the waterway which is <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s only sea outlet Under a 1975 treaty, which <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> repudiated five years later, the border runs down the middle of the waterway. The Iraqis want it moved to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s shore, where it was before the treaty. The Shatt-al-Arab, which <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> calls the <LOCATION> Arvand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, was closed soon after the war began in September 1980 and is blocked by stranded ships, unexploded shells and accumulated silt. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has pressed for dredging to begin immediately while negotiations on sovereignty continue. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has agreed in principle to a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> compromise that envisages dredging in conjunction with agreement on three points: withdrawal of forces to recognized borders, prisoner exchange and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s renunciation of the right to search ships in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> for war-related cargo It has discontinued the searches under the truce. <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> urged <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> on Monday to join in reactivating the <ORGANIZATION> Common </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coordination </ORGANIZATION>, an agency established by the 1975 treaty to resolve questions about navigation in the Shatt-al-Arab. In a statement read to the journalists before his meeting with <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> foreign minister said progress in the new negotiations `` depends much on <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s position'' toward the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> formula. The 15-member <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> passed Resolution 598 unanimously July 20, 1987, demanding a cease-fire in the war. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> accepted it immediately, on condition <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> do the same, and the Iranians agreed a year later. <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> said after Monday's meeting with <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> that his government would `` try to find solutions'' but added: `` It is up to the other side to show a similar sort of good faith and cooperation in order to achieve progress.'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> has said his first objective is disengagement of forces. The secretary-general said he also hopes for early `` substantial progress'' in the exchange of all prisoners, who <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> experts say total more than 100,000.

<TEXT>
 In an intriguing twist to the White House campaign, the nation's next vice president may be a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> senator or he may be a Democratic senator, but he almost certainly will be replaced in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by a Republican. The two vice presidential candidates are Republican <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and Democrat <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and the winner must resign his seat in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> before taking his oath as first-in-line to the presidency next Jan. 20. Under state law in both cases, the governor from the vice president's state would appoint a temporary replacement in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>'s situation is complicated because the state is picking a new governor this year. Democratic Secretary of State <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON> is rated a favorite over Republican <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mutz </PERSON>, but Republicans say they have no intention of winning the vice presidency only to surrender <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat to the Democrats. They expect <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> would resign from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> before <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON> could take office and permit outgoing Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> _ a Republican _ to make an appointment. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Schermerhorn </PERSON>, a spokesman for Secretary of <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bayh </ORGANIZATION> agreed it was up to <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> to decide when to resign from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. If <PERSON> Mutz </PERSON> wins the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> statehouse, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> would also have the option of waiting until the new governor took office before stepping aside. One Republican, speaking on condition of anonymity, speculated that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> would have more influence over <PERSON> Mutz </PERSON>'s decision than he would over <PERSON> Orr </PERSON>'s In any case, one frequently mentioned replacement is Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Coats </PERSON>, who served as an aide to <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and took over his old <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat when his mentor moved up to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Whoever the new <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator is, he or she would serve as an appointed lawmaker until the 1990 election, and then be eligible to run for the two years that would be remaining in <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s unexpired term. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> is complicated in a different way. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is seeking re-election to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> this year as well as running for vice president, and his rival, Rep. <PERSON> Beau </PERSON> <PERSON> Boulter </PERSON>, would replace him if he wins the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat. But if <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> wins his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat and the vice presidency, Republican Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> would name a new senator to serve until a special election were held. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, a spokesman in the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Secretary of State's office, said the state law does not dictate when that election must be held, and he expects a court case to resolve the matter

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> could win the presidency by honing his appeal to the sizable number of undecided voters, but the stability of his opponent's lead makes the task a formidable one, pollsters say. Two polls released Monday found Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> maintaining a healthy lead among likely voters _ 11 points in one survey done last week, seven points in a <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> poll conducted during the weekend. The Harris poll found <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> gaining a bit by countering <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s attacks of his record on crime Fifty-three percent rated <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as soft on crime, still high but down from 63 percent in an earlier poll by <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also appeared to score slightly by portraying <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign advertisements as unfair: While 68 percent called <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' own advertising too negative, a higher 75 percent said that of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Overall, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> put the race at 52-45 percent, a very slight narrowing from 53-44 in its Oct. 14-17 poll. The contest was 52-41 in the other new poll, done by <PERSON> Gallup </PERSON> for the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> the first half of last week. The Times Mirror poll found support for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> uneven within his own party, while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has solid backing from Republicans and siphoned away some Democrats. Gallup, in its analysis of the results, noted that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has led the race at least since September. Though the contest remained largely stable, the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> poll found that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had increasingly loyal support in key groups. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' popularity eroded, meanwhile, and he lost support in some Democratic groups even while gaining it in others. The problem in analyzing the race was <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s stable lead on one hand versus the weakness of voter preferences on the other. Twenty-seven percent of likely voters were undecided or said they might change their minds, and only about half of each candidates' supporters backed them strongly `` If <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign can get their act together and speak to their constituencies or potential constituencies, they can win it on the basis of the numbers,'' said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohut </PERSON>, the president of Gallup. `` But that's a big if, given the course of the campaign so far.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s lead was based upon overwhelming support from Republicans, solid backing from Republican-leaning independents and `` substantial defections'' from some Democratic groups, according to <PERSON> Kohut </PERSON>'s analysis. `` For <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, on the other hand, his support is not as strong among his own partisans; and he is receiving virtually no defections from members of core Republican groups,'' the analysis said. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> poll divides the electorate into 10 evenly sized groups whose members share general values. Its `` partisan poor,'' for example, is a Democratic group; its `` enterprisers'' and `` moralists'' are Republican. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> attracted 21 percent of the `` partisan poor,'' a good showing in a Democratic stronghold. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, by contrast, drew only 2 percent of the `` enterprisers'' and 3 percent of the `` moralists.'' `` Disaffected'' voters, a potential swing group whose members are set apart by their suspicion of government, continued to back <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by more than 2-1. And they were more loyal: Fifty-one percent said they were unlikely to switch to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, up from 36 percent last month. `` In contrast, on the Democratic side, defections to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> have doubled among ` seculars' and significantly increased among the ` partisan poor,''' Gallup's analysis said. While <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> offset the losses by gaining with other Democrats, the movement was `` indicative of the problems that the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign has had in achieving enthusiastic support'' from groups in his own party, it said. Among all registered voters, not just those likely to vote, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was rated favorably by 48 percent, compared with 58 percent favorable for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The poll analysis said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' rating was `` significantly below'' those of most candidates in recent presidential elections. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> poll was conducted Oct. 23-26 among 2,006 registered voters, of whom 1,505 were considered likely to vote. The Harris poll was done among 1,250 likely voters. Both had a three-point margins of error. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> polls gave <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the lead in two big states, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, it was 52 percent for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to 45 percent for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in a survey conducted Saturday and Sunday among 505 likely voters. The margin of error was plus or minus five percentage points. In a state poll of 510 likely voters conducted Saturday and Sunday, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> put the race in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> at 51 percent for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to 44 percent for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, again with a potential margin of sampling error of five points. Other recent surveys also have found <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> slightly ahead there. In <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald-WBZ-TV </ORGANIZATION> poll published today shows <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> leading <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by 49-42 percent there, although <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appears to have pulled closer. The same pollsters found <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with 49 percent to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 39 percent in mid-October. The latest poll of 400 likely <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> voters surveyed Saturday and Sunday had a five percentage point margin of error. In a separate poll in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> led <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> 53 percent to 39 percent among 397 likely voters. The poll was taken last Monday through Thursday and had a margin of error of four points. In <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, a survey of 1,019 likely voters Sunday through Thursday found <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> leading 45-40 percent. The survey had a margin of error of three points.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> investigation of Rep. <PERSON> Fernand </PERSON> <PERSON> St </PERSON> <PERSON> Germain </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, found `` substantial evidence of serious and sustained misconduct,'' according to court documents. The department nonetheless declined to prosecute <ORGANIZATION> St </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germain </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> Democrat, after investigating whether he accepted meals from lobbyists and failed to report them on his financial disclosure form, the court papers said. The documents, unsealed last week, quote a May 31 letter that the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sent to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee stating it had declined to prosecute <ORGANIZATION> St </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germain </ORGANIZATION>. `` We believe it is appropriate to refer the matter to your committee to consider whether Representative <PERSON> St </PERSON> <PERSON> Germain </PERSON> has violated any relevant standards of conduct,'' the department said in the letter by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keeney </PERSON>, then the acting assistant attorney general in charge of the criminal division. <LOCATION> St </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germain </LOCATION> on Monday night denied the ethics committee was reviewing <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> evidence on him. `` That is absolutely unfounded. This seems curious to me that it comes out eight days before the election,'' he said in a telephone interview. `` -LRB- The -RRB- ethics -LRB- committee -RRB- conducted a thorough investigation of me, and they cleared me. Justice conducted a thorough grand jury investigation of me, and they found they had nothing to proceed with. There was nothing there,'' said <ORGANIZATION> St </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germain </ORGANIZATION>. `` ... There is nothing going on, and I'm sick and tired of this.'' But in a court pleading dated Sept. 30, the ethics panel opposed public release of a resolution it adopted in closed session on June 23, saying it `` reveals ` confidential details' of the committee's investigation in that it recites the potential violations the committee believes may exist, based on the information in the letter'' from the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> investigated for accepting food, drink and entertainment from <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, lobbyist for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION>, and other financial industry lobbyists. According to the court papers, a federal judge in September granted the ethics committee access to grand jury information. The department's investigation had focused on a possible violation of anti-bribery statutes that prohibit members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> from accepting anything of value in return for an official act. The inquiry also dealt with whether the chairman should have disclosed meals <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> allegedly purchased on the annual financial statement <ORGANIZATION> St </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germain </ORGANIZATION> filed with the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. Last May, the department said it was declining to prosecute <ORGANIZATION> St </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germain </ORGANIZATION> and had closed the investigation. Its letter to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Official </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conduct </ORGANIZATION> was quoted in pleadings filed by the ethics panel in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to obtain the complete record of the grand jury's investigation of <ORGANIZATION> St </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germain </ORGANIZATION> The ethics panel was given access to the grand jury transcript as part of its investigation under a court order issued last summer with the consent of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The committee's investigation has not reached the stage of a preliminary inquiry, according to the papers filed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee. The papers were ordered unsealed last week by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, on a motion by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION>, a public-interest law firm founded by <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON>. Only portions of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> letter quoted in pleadings filed in the newspaper case by the committee were released by <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>. The pleadings reveal that in response to the May 31 letter, the ethics committee voted formally to request the grand jury material.

 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON>, who won fame and an acting <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> as an autocratic molder of young lawyers in `` The Paper Chase,'' was remembered upon his death at age 86 for his real-life role helping young actors to stardom. <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON>, who established himself as a stage, screen and radio producer and director before turning to acting late in life, brought a magnetic eloquence to the role of the curmudgeon as Professor <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kingsfield </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. He parlayed his fame from `` The Paper Chase'' movie and TV series and his distinctive speaking style into a lucrative series of commercial endorsements, including advertisements for the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION> in which he growled, `` They make money the old-fashioned way _ they EARN it.'' `` Behind that austere public posture was the warmest, most generous man in the world _ with his time, his remarkable intelligence, his insight,'' said writer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Rintels </PERSON>, who collaborated with <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON> on the movie `` Gideon's Trumpet'' and the play `` <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Darrow </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON> died at his seaside home before dawn Monday, said <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Goff </PERSON>, a family friend and scriptwriter. <PERSON> Margo </PERSON> <PERSON> Harley </PERSON>, a longtime friend and colleague, said he had spinal cancer. <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON>'s most significant contribution was his role advancing the work of young actors, Ms. <PERSON> Harley </PERSON> said. They included <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kline </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Reeve </PERSON>, <PERSON> Patti </PERSON> <PERSON> LuPone </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogden </PERSON> <PERSON> Stiers </PERSON>, with whom <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON> appears in the new <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> movie, `` Another Woman.'' `` He was really the last of the Renaissance men,'' she said. `` He was somebody who has been responsible, probably, for more people's careers in American theater than any single person.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginty </PERSON>, an actor who worked with <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON> in `` The Paper Chase'' television series, agreed. `` He was without question the No. 1 creative influence on my life.'' `` He was a gentleman of the old school, polite and courtly,'' said <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, who starred in the Houseman-produced movies `` Two Weeks in Another Town,'' `` The Bad and the Beautiful'' and `` Lust for Life.'' While best known for his work on screen, <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON> was a reluctant actor. His strongest affections were reserved for theater and opera production, book writing and the teaching of acting. <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON> achieved what he told friends was his ultimate goal: the establishment of the Acting Company, a touring ensemble of the nation's brightest theatrical talents. Born <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Haussmann </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, to an Alsatian father and a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> mother, he began his career in 1934 as the director of a Broadway production of the <PERSON> Gertrude </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein-Virgil </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON> opera `` Four Saints in Three Acts.'' He founded <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Mercury Theatre with <LOCATION> Orson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Welles </LOCATION> in 1937 <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON> produced the `` War of the Worlds'' radio broadcast for <LOCATION> Welles </LOCATION>, a panic-inducing account of an imagined Martian invasion of Grovers Mill, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, broadcast 50 years ago last Sunday. Though uncredited, <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON> was instrumental in making Welles' legendary film `` Citizen Kane'' in 1941. As an actor, <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON> played small roles in <LOCATION> Welles </LOCATION>' never-completed 1938 film `` Too Much Johnson'' and the 1964 film `` Seven Days in May'' before emerging as a strong film character in the 1973 `` The Paper Chase. He won a best supporting actor <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> for his portrayal of <LOCATION> Kingsfield </LOCATION>. His subsequent acting credits included `` Three Days of the Condor,'' `` The Cheap Detective'' `` St. Ives,'' `` Old Boyfriends,'' `` The Fog'' and `` Bright Lights, <LOCATION> Big </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.'' He also starred in the 1978-79 CBS-TV series based on the movie `` The Paper Chase.'' He returned with the show when it was revived in 1983 by cable television as `` The Paper Chase: The Second Year.'' <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON> was featured in the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> miniseries `` The Winds of War'' as Dr. <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Jastrow </PERSON>, a Jewish scholar in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> at the start of World War II. During World War II in real life, <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON> was head of overseas radio programming for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which broadcast `` Voice of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' programs in more than two dozen languages. In the 1950s he produced a television classic, `` The Seven Lively Arts,'' and several `` Playhouse 90'' shows, winning three Emmy Awards. Between 1945 and 1962, <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON> produced 18 feature films, including `` Letter from an Unknown Woman,'' `` The Blue Dahlia,'' `` <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Caesar </PERSON>,'' `` Executive Suite'' and `` Lust for Life.'' <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON>'s theater productions included `` Lute Song'' with <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, `` Hamlet'' with <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Blitzstein </PERSON>'s `` The Cradle Will Rock.'' `` He's probably the greatest human being that I ever met in my lifetime or will ever meet,'' said <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, his partner and executive producer of `` The Paper Chase'' for Showtime. `` He was superb at everything he did, as a writer, director, producer, actor, teacher and a thinker. `` When you told him he was n't a curmudgeon at all, he'd say, ` Do n't say that. You're ruining my reputation.''' Survivors include his wife, <PERSON> Joan </PERSON>, and two sons. There will be no funeral, but a memorial service was being planned, said publicist <PERSON> Judi </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON>.

The Tutsi-dominated army was sent to quell the unrest, but turned against the Hutu, according to witnesses. The curfew and travel restrictions, which banned movement between provinces unless special permission was obtained from authorities, were lifted today, according to the radio. More than 60,000 Burundians, mostly Hutus, fled to neighboring <LOCATION> Rwanda </LOCATION> to escape the bloodshed. The Hutu represent about 84 percent of the country's 5 million people and the Tutsi 15 percent.

 A Marine with emotional troubles caused by 444 days of captivity at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> will be honorably discharged soon despite his desire to remain in the service, officials said. Staff Sgt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKeel </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 35, who contends his problems are manageable, will be discharged with a 10 percent medical disability within 20 days, according to a statement Monday by the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> McKeel </PERSON>, who is stationed at <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pendleton </LOCATION>, was a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> guard at the embassy in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> when it was stormed by radicals on Nov. 4, 1979, following the revolution that toppled the <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and brought the <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomenei </PERSON> to power in February of that year. He was among 52 Americans held hostage 444 days before being released Jan. 20, 1981. <PERSON> McKeel </PERSON>, a Marine for nearly 13 years, has said civilian doctors diagnosed him in 1985 as suffering from post-traumatic stress syndrome. The federal Privacy Act of 1974 prohibits release of details of <PERSON> McKeel </PERSON>'s career and military doctors' diagnoses of his medical condition. `` Due to the nature of his disability and the length of his service, Staff Sgt. <PERSON> McKeel </PERSON> will be entitled to two years of his base pay -LRB- about $ 34,000 -RRB- as a severance payment,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> statement said. `` The commandant of the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, due to the special circumstances involved, conducted an in-depth review of Staff Sgt. <PERSON> McKeel </PERSON>'s case to ensure that every available option had been considered.'' Telephone calls to <PERSON> McKeel </PERSON>'s home in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marcos </LOCATION>, 35 miles north of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, went unanswered Monday evening. <PERSON> McKeel </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> native, has said he wo n't fight the discharge because his enlistment is up in March and he has no legal right to re-enlist because he has less than 18 years in the service. However, he does n't believe the Marines have treated him fairly or exhausted all efforts to find a job that his condition will allow him to handle. `` I'm perfectly capable of doing a good job. They just wo n't give me -LRB- one -RRB-,'' <PERSON> McKeel </PERSON> said last month when he first complained publicly about his situation `` If you put your life on the line for your country, they ought to repay you some other way than saying, ` Hit the road.' After the awards and the honors you get, they do this to you.'' <PERSON> McKeel </PERSON> said the civilian doctors who diagnosed him wanted to place him in a treatment program for former prisoners of war, but the <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> would n't approve it. He was instead sent back to <PERSON> Camp </PERSON> <PERSON> Pendleton </PERSON> and assigned to supply duty while undergoing periodic counseling, which <PERSON> McKeel </PERSON> said helped a little. <PERSON> McKeel </PERSON> said he decided to discuss his problem publicly because `` if more people speak up, a lot of stuff like this might not happen.''

 Newspapers reported today <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has agreed to the substance of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal to grant independence to <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> before a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> withdrawal from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. Until now, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> linked independence for the territory commonly called <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> to the departure of some 50,000 Cuban troops supporting <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s Marxist government. But the Citizen, a pro-government newspaper, and Business Day, the country's leading financial daily, said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> would allow about half the Cuban forces to remain in the northern part of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> for a year after independence elections in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was expected to announce the proposal and positions of the various parties today. South African officials declined to comment directly on the newspaper reports. But Foreign Minister <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said, `` <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is of the view that sufficient progress was made at the informal consultations which took place at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> from 6-9 October to allow agreement to be reached by 1 November.'' In a statement, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> have not responded to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan although they were asked to do so by Oct. 12. `` <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has ... indicated that it was prepared to be flexible as far as the latest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal is concerned,'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said. `` Any delay in achieving independence for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> can therefore not be attributable to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> ANGOP </ORGANIZATION> news agency quoted President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> as saying `` it's possible the implementation -LRB- of Namibian independence -RRB- will begin some time in November, December or January.'' <PERSON> Dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> said there still were unresolved questions concerning the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> troop withdrawal, according to the <ORGANIZATION> ANGOP </ORGANIZATION> dispatch, which was monitored in <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>. The Cubans reportedly are insisting on a 30-month withdrawal, compared to U.S-South African proposals of 24 months. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has said it wanted to begin implementing Namibian independence today, leading to elections June 1. But it has given no indication it will begin the independence process without a timetable on the Cuban withdrawal. The Citizen and Business Day said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> now seeks to begin granting independence to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> on Jan. 1, leading to elections Aug. 1. Under this plan, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> would move its troops to the northern half of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> by March 31 and withdraw about half by Aug. 1, The Citizen said. The remaining troops would depart by the end of 1990, the newspaper said. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mediators have been holding periodic talks since May in a bid to settle on a timetable for the withdrawal of the Cuban forces. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the combined Cuban-Angolan forces have been observing a cease-fire since Aug. 8, and there have been no reports of violations. At the end of August, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> withdrew its troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, where they were fighting alongside the anti-Marxist <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> rebels in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s 13-year-old war. <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> has not been involved in the peace talks and continues to fight in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Defense Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> signed an agreement with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> today for the Arab nation to help produce M-1A1 tanks, the most sophisticated in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arsenal. After three years of negotiation, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> will become the first country apart from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to build a modified version of the tank, also known as the <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> tank. Before signing the agreement, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> met President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> for an hour of `` very friendly'' talks, the defense secretary told reporters. The meeting, also attended by Defense Minister <PERSON> Abdel-Halim </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu-Ghazala </PERSON>, centered on <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> developments and bilateral military relations which were `` progressing very well,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said. Since 1984, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has given <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> $ 1.3 billion a year in military aid. After talking to <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> met seperately with <PERSON> Abu-Ghazala </PERSON>. The two ministers signed a memorandum of understanding to co-produce the 57-ton tanks armed with 120mm guns. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said the tanks are `` the best in the world,'' and <PERSON> Abu-Ghazala </PERSON> lauded the agreement as `` a gigantic step in the military industry in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>.'' Under the memorandum, 40 percent of the tank will be made in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and the rest, manufactured in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, will be assembled at an Egyptian plant. <PERSON> Abu-Ghazala </PERSON> said the Egyptian-manufactured component will increase gradually. The Egyptian plant will start operating this year, he said, and the first tank will be produced sometime next year. The agreement provides for up to 555 tanks and associated spare parts. <PERSON> Abu-Ghazala </PERSON> also said that starting Wednesday, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> will receive U.S.-made remotely piloted vehicles _ the small unmanned airplanes used for tracking, reconnaissance and target practice. Without specifying a number, the Egyptian minister said <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> will get one every other day. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> later left for <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON> to visit the headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> Multinational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and Observers monitoring the border between <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.

 Finance Minister <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Gostev </PERSON> said today that the Soviet national budget has been in the red for the past decade, and that the deficit was `` critically large'' in the mid-1980s before beginning to drop. <PERSON> Gostev </PERSON>'s revelation at a news conference came just days after the Supreme Soviet passed a 494 billion ruble -LRB- $ 795 billion -RRB- 1989 budget with a 34 billion ruble -LRB- $ 55 billion -RRB- deficit. In presenting that budget, <PERSON> Gostev </PERSON> acknowledged for the first time that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had a budget deficit. `` I'd say it's been in existence for about 10 years. It was extremely large, critically large, in the last years of the previous five-year plan period,'' <PERSON> Gostev </PERSON> told reporters. He said the deficit then was 37 billion rubles -LRB- $ 59 billion -RRB-. `` For the first time we have clearly stated that a deficit exists,'' <PERSON> Gostev </PERSON> said. `` We can not live with a budget deficit. So we'll try to get rid of it during the year.'' He said economic managers would try to trim $ 40 billion from the budget, cut down on administration and get money-losing state businesses, 24,000 of which are bankrupt, to turn a profit. Western analysts said Monday they think the Soviet budget deficit is larger than officials have said, and may threaten Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms. <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanous </PERSON>, who develops models of the Soviet economy for the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> firm <ORGANIZATION> PlanEcon </ORGANIZATION>, estimated the deficit at 65 billion rubles to 75 billion rubles -LRB- $ 104 billion to $ 120 billion -RRB- each in 1987 and 1988. <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Maslyukov </PERSON>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and an alternate member of the ruling Politburo, told the news conference that the Soviet economy has inflation of 0.9 percent to 1.5 percent. <PERSON> Maslyukov </PERSON> said wages have risen faster than labor productivity. `` We have more money than we have goods. That's why the shelves in the stores are empty,'' he said. Some economic analysts say cheap consumer goods are hard to find in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> because of the system of setting prices. Since producers are not free to raise prices gradually on their goods, they stop manufacturing them and replace them with more expensive products on which they can make a profit. Showing a profit has become increasingly important as <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> pushes reforms requiring local managers to account for profits and losses. But <PERSON> Maslyukov </PERSON> said officials were not considering eliminating government control over prices. `` If we want to maintain the low level of prices we must ensure state control. Otherwise, we are not ready for the anarchy of the market. Competition in the internal economy will be required. The basis for that is not yet ready,'' <PERSON> Maslyukov </PERSON> said.

 Israeli fighter-bombers attacked guerrilla bases near <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and the southern port of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> today. Police said the raid killed four people, wounded 15 and set several targets ablaze. Six U.S.-made F-16s blasted positions held by Syrian-backed guerrillas around <LOCATION> Aramoun </LOCATION>, 10 miles southeast of the capital, police said. In <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, 25 miles south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, the planes hit <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> installations in the Mieh Mieh refugee camp and the nearby hills of En el-Dilb. The raid came in apparent retaliation for the killings of four Israelis in a Palestinian firebombing Sunday, and followed <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> attacks late last month that killed 36 people after the Oct. 19 bombing of an Israeli army convoy in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Eight Israeli soldiers died in the bombing. Today's midday raid, which police and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> said lasted six minutes, came as Israelis cast ballots in a general election that could have a significant impact on <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> relations. Police said the Palestinian casualties were in the Mieh Mieh refugee camp on the southeastern outskirts of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>. The four dead included three guerrillas and a civilian motorist who was driving at <LOCATION> Mieh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mieh </LOCATION> when the planes struck. The wounded were two women and 13 guerrillas, police said. There were no immediate casualty reports from the strike on the hills overlooking the coastal stretch between <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, the Israeli army command said all jets returned safely and pilots reported all targets destroyed. It said the targets included storehouses for ammunition. A report sent from <PERSON> Mieh </PERSON> <PERSON> Mieh </PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> and made available to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> also said several houses in the camp were reduced to rubble. On <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>'s southeastern outskirts, flames shot up from the bases in <LOCATION> Mieh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mieh </LOCATION> and the hills of En el-Dilb as the planes swept in on four bombing runs, police reported. Ambulances and fire engines raced to the scene. The warplanes fired eight rockets in four sorties, devastating four buildings used as bases by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> 17 security apparatus, police said By police count, a total of 104 people were killed and 184 wounded in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 19 previous air strikes in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since Jan. 3.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> today blasted Republican rival <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as the candidate of privilege, touted himself as the candidate of working people and told a union audience the only label he likes is `` Made in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> sounded populist themes at a town meeting in a former steelworkers' union hall decorated with signs reading, `` <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Unions Vote <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' as he toured major industrial states in the final week before the Nov. 8 election. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor mentioned the `` merger mania'' on Wall Street and said, `` I'm not interested in the sharp operators, I'm interested in the lathe operators and the machine operators. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> tackled <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s repeated efforts to tag him as a liberal who is out of touch with mainstream <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` The vice president likes to talk about labels,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` You know the label I'm interested in? ` Made in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>' is the label I'm interested in.'' With 23 electoral votes, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> is crucial to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' strategy for scoring an election upset over the vice president in national balloting one week from today. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides do n't dispute public opinion polls showing the Democratic nominee trailing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, but they claim the gap is narrowing. `` This is not my first visit to this valley,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told his audience in the economically troubled <LOCATION> Mahoning </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, where most of the once thriving steel industry has shut down. `` To my knowledge, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has never been here,'' he said, adding that the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee's absence tells much about the differences between the two candidates. `` I know what a community like this has gone through,'' he said. People in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, and College Park, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, also heard <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> through a satellite hookup and were able to ask questions of the candidate. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> suggested that a heavy fine imposed by the <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> against a big meatpacking company for alleged safety violations was politically motivated because it came 10 days before the election. `` My question is, where was <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> before that?'' he asked. `` We need an <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> that's in at the beginning, insisting companies obey the law.'' From <LOCATION> Youngstown </LOCATION> the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate flies to <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, for rallies. The campaign bought five minutes on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> at 10:55 p.m. EST -LRB- 9:55 p.m. CST -RRB- tonight for another appeal to voters. In that speech, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will accuse the Republicans of `` waging the lowest level campaign in modern history. They are engaged in a scorched earth policy against the truth.'' He also was identifying with past <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> presidents _ with the notable exception of <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> _ and pledging to make <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> first in education, health care, and exporting products. On the flight East after three days of campaigning in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides argued Monday night that the candidate had finally found the combination he needed to close with a rush. `` People who may have been swayed by negative advertising are taking a second look now,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> political adviser <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Engelberg </PERSON>. `` ` I'm on your side' is striking a chord,'' said <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, another senior campaign adviser. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> drew big, enthusiastic crowds on two campuses in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` I'm fired up,'' he said as he left a rally at <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jose </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. The populist theme was in the forefront at a later rally on the campus of <ORGANIZATION> Cerritos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> a few miles south of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` I said yesterday, I was proud to stand in the tradition of some great presidents _ the liberal tradition of great presidents like <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Roosevelt </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>,'' he told the cheering crowd. Republicans, he said, `` do n't understand this tradition, the tradition of being on the side of working families.'' `` Coming out and affirming the liberal thing was good,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Boulgarides </PERSON>, vice mayor of <LOCATION> Culver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, who was on the stage with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> at the <LOCATION> Cerritos </LOCATION> rally. When asked if he thought it played well the previous day when the Democratic nominee campaigned in the more conservative <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joaquin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Boulgarides </PERSON> said, `` Supposedly it got received very well, but he was talking to his own people.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> made a particular appeal to women, saying the Republican ticket of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was `` on the wrong side of every issue of special importance to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women.''

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told fellow Californians today that presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` is no <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>, and he's no FDR'' _ two presidents the Democrat has tied himself to in recent days. In a speech prepared for delivery at <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fullerton </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also sought to turn aside <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' contention that `` I'm on your side.'' `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is the one and the only one who's on your side,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told the students. `` And that's not negative campaigning. That's the truth.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, in campaign appearances this week, has said, `` I'm a liberal in the tradition of <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Roosevelt </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who has derided <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as a liberal throughout the campaign, said in his speech, `` Do n't be fooled, folks, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s opponent is no <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>, and he's no FDR.'' In a speech prepared for a later stop at the National Orange Show Stadium in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> continued his onslaught on the Democratic record, saying, `` We've been slashing tax rates and liberating the American economy from the confiscation of the malaise years.'' `` We cleared away the wrecks the liberals left behind, waved the green flag, fired the starter pistol, and watched you go to the races,'' he said in his speech at the agricultural trade center 60 miles east of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. In his gymnasium speech at <LOCATION> Cal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fullerton </LOCATION>, a commuter university with more than 22,000 students, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> warned against complacency and said, `` This election campaign is not over, and the only poll that means a thing is the one on Election Day. That's why it's so important for you to vote.'' The two speeches were <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s final pitch to fellow Californians, whose 47 electoral votes are crucial to either candidate's hopes. The president will also campaign in the battleground state of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, appearing at <ORGANIZATION> Baldwin-Wallace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Berea </LOCATION> on Wednesday. <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> has 23 electoral votes and, like <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, is a hotly contested prize in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s White House battle with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is also putting his prestige on the line on behalf of Republican senatorial candidates in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. From <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, he was flying to <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, for a rally in support of first-term GOP Sen. Chic <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON>, facing a stiff battle with popular Democratic Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON>, a quiet, sometimes inarticulate former banker and clothing store owner, was elected in 1982 after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> came into the state for two appearances in October. `` He jumped me up 8 or 10 points and I stayed there and won,'' <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON> said in a 1986 interview. In 1986, however, appearances in the state by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> failed to save the faltering <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> campaign of then Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Santini </PERSON>, as Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> won election. National Republican <ORGANIZATION> Senatorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> records show that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> campaigned for <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidates for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 17 states in 1986. Only six of them were elected, as Democrats regained the control they had lost with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s election in 1980. Before flying to <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> on Wednesday, the president goes to <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> to put in a pitch for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> campaign of <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Engeleiter </PERSON>, Republican leader of the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> State Senate. Public opinion polls show Mrs. <PERSON> Engeleiter </PERSON> trailing <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bucks </ORGANIZATION> basketball team. Still, presidential appearances can help, as both <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON> and former <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> Republican Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON> can testify. In an interview in 1986, <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON> recalled his 1964 race against Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON>, who ended up defeating him by a narrow margin after a campaign appearance by President <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. `` We had <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON> on the run and I think we had the race won, and the big Texan came in with guns blazing into <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> and he literally blew me away,'' <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON> said.

 In an emotionally electric climate of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> firebomb attacks and reprisal air raids, Israelis today cast ballots in watershed elections expected to determine the future of the occupied lands. More than 300 Arabs and 10 Jews have been killed in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> in the nearly 11-month-old Palestinian uprising against 21 years of Israeli rule. Election officials reported a heavy voter turnout under clear skies. A massive security force protected polling places. The army sealed off the occupied lands, where a Palestinian general strike was taking place. Political observers said the slaying of four Israelis in a firebomb attack Sunday would tilt undecided voters to Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, which opposes <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> withdrawal from the occupied lands. Labor, led by Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, has offered such a withdrawal in return for peace. As its citizens voted, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> raided <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> guerrilla targets in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in apparent retaliation for a firebomb attack Sunday. Lebanese police said four people were killed and 15 wounded. In Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, assailants today threw a firebomb at a car, injuring three people, police said. Witnesses said the car was plastered with stickers for the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc and was being used to transport voters. By midafternoon, 41 percent of the electorate, or about 1,090,000 voters, had cast ballots. Results were to be announced after polls closed at 10 p.m. -LRB- 3 p.m. EST -RRB-. Neither Labor or <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> has succeeded in gaining a majority in the 120-member <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> since the Jewish state was established in 1948. Polls indicated they would fail again. The situation has forced Labor and <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> to form alliances with minor parties that have gained influence beyond their numbers. Twenty-seven parties were entered in the election. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> and Labor formed a fractious coalition after the 1984 elections, when neither party could arrange a majority with the small parties. Election officials said the turnout was heavy, indicating that 75 to 80 percent of eligible voters would cast ballots. In the 1984 election, voter turnout was 78.7 percent. Analysts said the high turnout would favor <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> because much of its support comes from lower - and working-class voters more easily deterred from voting by bad weather and transportation problems Police reported 74 incidents ranging from fistfights to unlawful campaigning near polling stations. Three people were reported arrested. The army sealed off the occupied territories for 48 hours, beginning at 11 p.m. Monday, and imposed curfews on refugee camps in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. Journalists were barred without army permission and escort from entering the territories, where a Palestinian general strike was under way. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> employee <PERSON> Rahamim </PERSON> <PERSON> Fadikler </PERSON> voted in a working class <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> neighborhood. `` My family and I vote for <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. `` The people here do n't want to return the territories. We suffered the shelling in 1967 and we do n't want to see it again.'' He was referring to shelling of settlements along the border before <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured the territories from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 Middle East War. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> favors the strengthening of Jewish settlement in the occupied lands, which 70,000 settlers share uneasily with 1.5 million Palestinians. In the election, 2.9 million voters were eligible to cast ballots. Results were not expected until Wednesday. More than 13,000 policemen and civil guardsmen were deployed at the 4,800 polling stations. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> planned to spend about $ 2.5 million, hiring taxicabs and buses and using the services of 10,000 volunteer drivers to get voters to the polls. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, streets were littered with political fliers. Polls taken before Sunday's firebombing and published in the Maariv newspaper Monday gave the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> an edge or pointed to a deadlock. In four different polls, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> and its allies were projected to receive between 47 and 55 seats with <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> and its partners getting between 56-65 seats. Labor's best chance of blocking a <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> coalition appeared to be an alliance with the far left expected to win eight seats among <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 350,000 Arab voters. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> accused Labor of readiness to form a coalition with `` non-Zionist'' parties and <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> would form an alliance with the extreme right-wing parties. Both indicated the possibility of another national unity government.

<HEAD>Study Says U.S. Defense System Needs Overhaul</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The American defense establishment needs to be overhauled to take account of a lessened threat from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and heightened risks in other areas, says a study by a private research organization. Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s internal reform efforts have somewhat lessened the military threat to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at the same time that threats from other sources, such as terrorism and economic-based problems, have increased, concluded the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> report. `` Due to Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s initiatives, that threat appears to have decreased. At the same time, we find ourselves increasingly threatened by smaller, third-world countries, terrorism and unconventional problems like drugs, environmental pollution and instability,'' the study said. `` In the face of this horizontal escalation, we find that our force structure, intelligence system and operating procedures are all geared to the large single threat; we do not have the flexibility required for these smaller, more diffuse hazards,'' it said. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> describes itself as a non-partisan educational organization. The five-year-old organization is based in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and has previously sponsored studies on security-related issues such as arms control. It board of advisors includes <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Rumsfeld </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary. The report said `` a new ominous potential threat looms in the growing influence of the drug cartels of <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> over the legitimate governments of that area.'' The solutions it proposed include a `` Marshall Plan'' for <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, increased flexibility in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military structure and intelligence-gathering apparatus, and new attention to global environmental problems. The report also urged the winner of next Tuesday's presidential election, either Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> or Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, to quickly call a `` budget summit'' with <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> leaders to deal with looming defense budget problems. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget will be a key concern of the new administration. Defense spending rose sharply each year during President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first term, but has been essentially frozen during his second term. The current defense budget is $ 300 billion and is not likely to rise much regardless of who is elected Nov. 8. `` Overly optimistic projections of defense budget growth coupled with relatively larger growth of internal fixed accounts and public pressure against increasing defense spending will result in a decrease of $ 250 billion to $ 400 billion for defense in the next five years from what the military had assumed,'' it said. During <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first term, the military services made down payments on a large number of new weapons systems. Some of those weapons may have to be canceled. The report also said the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending effort should be broadened to keep pace with the new view. `` Carefully selected projects in the areas of education, industry, research and development and energy policy would be funded specifically as security projects,'' it said.

 Firebombs hurled by Palestinians today set ablaze a car carrying <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc voters to the polls. Witnesses said the bomb set fire to the hair of a woman passenger, seriously injuring her and the two men in the car. In <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> warplanes blasted <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrilla targets along in apparent retaliation for a firebomb attack in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> that killed a Jewish woman and her three sons on Sunday. Lebanese police said four people were killed and 15 wounded in the 20th air raid this year. Palestinians staged a general strike, shutting businesses and public transportation throughout the occupied lands. Troops shot and wounded four demonstrators in stone-throwing clashes in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, Arab hospital officials said. The stepped-up violence coincided with parliamentary elections in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> that pitted Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> against Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>' leftist <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Analysts said the attacks on <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> civilians would give a last-minute boost to right-wing parties that advocate tougher policies in dealing with the nearly 11-month Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories. As a security precaution, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops confined 250,000 refugee camp residents to their homes in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> and banned Arabs from traveling to or from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for 48 hours. At least 300 Arabs and 10 Jews have been killed in the Palestinian uprising, which began Dec. 8. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, witnesses said gasoline-filled bottles set fire to a car covered with campaign stickers that was being used to carry <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> supporters to the polls. The driver lost control, smashed into a parked car and careened across the road. The vehicle was in flames within seconds, victims said. `` A man rushed close from a side alley and threw the firebomb from a very short distance,'' passenger <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Assis </PERSON>, 26, said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> army radio. `` We were screaming because there were only Arabs around.'' An <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> passerby who identified himself only as <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the woman emerged from the car, her hair in flames, and residents came out of their houses to help. `` She jumped out of the car and her hair was burning. People ran from their houses to put the fire out,'' he told a reporter. The woman, <PERSON> Yocheved </PERSON> <PERSON> Farbish </PERSON>, 23, was in serious condition at <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Shaarei </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zedek </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, hospital officials said. <PERSON> Assis </PERSON> and his friend <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kazdan </PERSON>, 26, the driver of the car, suffered light facial burns. Police said about 30 Arabs were detained for questioning, and said they suspected Palestinians were behind the attack. On Sunday, a 27-year-old school teacher and her three sons, aged 9 months to 3 years, burned to death when Palestinians hurled firebombs at a civilian bus outside <LOCATION> Jericho </LOCATION>. Beefed up army patrols guarded main roads in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> today to assure safe travel to polling places for Jewish settlers, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reporters said. In other developments, a military spokesman confirmed that soldiers on reserve duty in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> stripped and beat <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> prisoners several weeks ago. One was accused of using a dog to scare the prisoners. The spokesman, who confirmed a report published in a weekly <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> paper, said a battalion commander, his deputy and a sergeant would be summoned to a disciplinary hearing. He said the deputy commander will be transferred from his post. The names of those being disciplined were not released. In <LOCATION> Jericho </LOCATION>, 18 miles east of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, the army on Monday dynamited three houses and demolished four other homes belonging to suspects in firebomb attacks. Israeli politicians had called for vengeance for the firebombing Sunday that killed <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, 27, and her three children, and <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> broadcast footage of the explosions on its nightly newscast Monday. Three of the demolished homes belonged to suspects in the attack, the army said. It said the other homes belonged to other firebomb assailants captured Monday when troops searched the city of 17,000. Hundreds of ultra-Orthodox Jews in long black coats attended Monday's funeral in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> for Ms. <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> and her children, aged 9 months to 3 years.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told fellow Californians today that presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` is no <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>, and he's no FDR'' _ two presidents the Democrat has tied himself to in recent days. In a speech prepared for delivery at <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fullerton </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also sought to turn aside <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' contention that `` I'm on your side.'' `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is the one and the only one who's on your side,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told the students. `` And that's not negative campaigning. That's the truth.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, in campaign appearances this week, has said, `` I'm a liberal in the tradition of <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Roosevelt </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who has derided <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as a liberal throughout the campaign, said in his speech, `` Do n't be fooled, folks, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s opponent is no <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>, and he's no FDR.'' In a speech prepared for a later stop at the National Orange Show Stadium in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> continued his onslaught on the Democratic record, saying, `` We've been slashing tax rates and liberating the American economy from the confiscation of the malaise years.'' `` We cleared away the wrecks the liberals left behind, waved the green flag, fired the starter pistol, and watched you go to the races,'' he said in his speech at the agricultural trade center 60 miles east of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. In his gymnasium speech at <LOCATION> Cal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fullerton </LOCATION>, a commuter university with more than 22,000 students, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> warned against complacency and said, `` This election campaign is not over, and the only poll that means a thing is the one on Election Day. That's why it's so important for you to vote.'' The two speeches were <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s final pitch to fellow Californians, whose 47 electoral votes are crucial to either candidate's hopes. The president will also campaign in the battleground state of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, appearing at <ORGANIZATION> Baldwin-Wallace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Berea </LOCATION> on Wednesday. <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> has 23 electoral votes and, like <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, is a hotly contested prize in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s White House battle with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is also putting his prestige on the line on behalf of Republican senatorial candidates in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. From <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, he was flying to <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, for a rally in support of first-term GOP Sen. Chic <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON>, facing a stiff battle with popular Democratic Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON>, a quiet, sometimes inarticulate former banker and clothing store owner, was elected in 1982 after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> came into the state for two appearances in October. `` He jumped me up 8 or 10 points and I stayed there and won,'' <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON> said in a 1986 interview. In 1986, however, appearances in the state by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> failed to save the faltering <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> campaign of then Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Santini </PERSON>, as Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> won election. National Republican <ORGANIZATION> Senatorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> records show that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> campaigned for <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidates for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 17 states in 1986. Only six of them were elected, as Democrats regained the control they had lost with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s election in 1980. Before flying to <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> on Wednesday, the president goes to <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> to put in a pitch for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> campaign of <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Engeleiter </PERSON>, Republican leader of the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> State Senate. Public opinion polls show Mrs. <PERSON> Engeleiter </PERSON> trailing <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bucks </ORGANIZATION> basketball team. Still, presidential appearances can help, as both <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON> and former <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> Republican Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON> can testify. In an interview in 1986, <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON> recalled his 1964 race against Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON>, who ended up defeating him by a narrow margin after a campaign appearance by President <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. `` We had <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON> on the run and I think we had the race won, and the big Texan came in with guns blazing into <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> and he literally blew me away,'' <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON> said.

 A top politicial fund-raiser for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s presidential campaign denounced as `` rotten'' today a published report suggesting he had tried to use his position to land a contract with the government of <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> for his public relations company <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who is not related to the vice president, said his business partner, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Govan </PERSON>, had written the Haitian government after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> specifically told <PERSON> Govan </PERSON> to `` forget it.'' `` We got an inquiry from the government of <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in an interview. `` My partner mentioned this to me a long time ago. I said I do n't want anything to do with foreign governments. I do n't want anything to do with <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, and do n't respond. `` I'm not interested in doing that kind of work,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> & amp; <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, his six-person, Washington-based firm, does public relations work for non-profit groups. Although the Oct. 12 letter to Haitian President Prosper <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> bore his signature, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the signature was written by <PERSON> Govan </PERSON>. The overture by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s firm was disclosed today by The <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> -RRB- Sentinel, which quoted the letter in part: `` Given the fragile environment in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> and the ensuing presidential election in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, there exists a window of opportunity for us to combine our resources and energies for the mutual benefit of our two countries.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> served as deputy finance chairman for the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nominee's primary election campaign and now serves as a financial consultant at the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The letter sent by <ORGANIZATION> Bush </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> offered <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> a variety of lobbying services and said, `` We are confident that we can effectively work in the transitional environment in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to assist <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>.'' An attachment to the two-page letter promoted <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s connections with the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential campaign and his former job on the White House staff, the newspaper said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he found out about the letter Monday evening from a reporter, and discussed it with <PERSON> Govan </PERSON>. `` Put it this way, I'm very upset,'' he said. `` This is a rotten, rotten thing to happen. ... It looks bad for me and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign.'' He said he was having <PERSON> Govan </PERSON> write the Haitian government to sever the possibility of any future relationship. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign spokesman, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON>, characterized the matter today as `` much ado about nothing.'' He said <PERSON> Govan </PERSON> had been `` overzealous in responding to a letter from the government of <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>. ... <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not seek out a contact with the government of <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>. They sought him out. His partner responded to their request for a proposal but apparently was unaware that <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> already had made a decision he did not want to do business with <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he had withdrawn from active participation in the company's affairs because of his fund-raising duties for the vice president in the past two years, starting before the vice president became a formal candidate when he raised money for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s political action committee, the Fund For <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Future. Six weeks ago, <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>'s regime ousted the government that had been having trouble conducting a peaceful election. After a November 1987 election was canceled because of violence, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government cut off $ 89 million in aid. Only food and development aid has continued through international humanitarian organizations. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, while pleased with recent steps taken by <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> to improve the political climate and rein in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s military, have said there is little prospect of restoring full assistance to <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> until the next president and a new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> take office in January.

 <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> climbed into the cockpit of an F-16 fighter jet today as he toured a defense plant and described <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as a liberal who supports a strong national defense. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> recently said he was a liberal `` in the terms of <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and a <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> and I do n't think anyone ever questioned their being for a strong national defense,'' said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, who toured the General Dynamics plant here. The Democratic vice presidential nominee said the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration was trying to cut F-16 purchases by the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, from 180 a year to 100, while he and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> planned to emphasize conventional weapons such as the F-16. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> rode around the plant in a golf cart with General Dynamics General Manager C.A. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, stopping at one point to shake hands in a crowd of several hundred employees who greeted him with enthusiasm. Many chanted `` <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>,'' and several employees yelled out in objection to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, calling him a draft dodger. There were also <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supporters in evidence, but they did not heckle or disturb the tour of the mile-long plant, which manufactures about 300 jets a year. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, a former World War II bomber pilot, tried the latest F-16C fighter on for size, squeezing into the single-seat cockpit for the cameras, and lowering the canopy. `` It fits like a wetsuit,'' he declared afterward, joking to reporters that he'd fly it to the next campaign stop and meet his entourage there. Taking questions afterward, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> brushed aside questions as to whether <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> hurt the ticket's chances in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> by saying he is a liberal. `` You know, what you have to look at and read is how he stated it. He talked about it in the terms of <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>, in the terms of <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, in the terms of balanced budgets, in the terms of paying your own way,'' he said. `` Those are the things he's pushed for,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. The Republican administration `` talks about fiscal responsiblity and has n't given us a balanced budget yet,'' he said. According to recent polls, the Democratic ticket of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> trail in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, which has 29 electoral votes at stake. On Monday night, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> put aside his defense speech for visits to two black Baptist churches in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, including a stop where he was joined by former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. At the first stop, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> sat on the floor with children at a Halloween party. He and <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> gave out candy prizes to winners of a costume contest. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> joined <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> at the second stop _ a rally at the <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Olive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> _ and was the featured speaker of the night. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, who spoke first, got a friendly reception when he told the crowd to get out and vote. `` Do n't tell me your vote does n't count _ it does,'' he said Reciting the Republican record on social issues, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> highlighted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> running mate <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s votes against civil rights legislation. `` Senator <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has stated that civil rights is not very high on his list of priorities,'' he said. `` How do you like the idea of a man like that being a heartbeat away from the president.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> also included an attack on the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> proposals earlier in the decade to trim back Social Security spending. The social security check, `` for some of them, that's all they have, is n't it,'' he said. The Republican willingness to cut that back, `` That's reason enough to vote against them,'' he said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, clearly the favorite of the crowd, attacked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s call for a `` kinder, gentler nation'' as `` nice words from some speechwriter but they do n't fit.'' He called <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign `` mean-spirited'' and he had an answer to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s phrase of `` read my lips.'' `` You watch our hips as we march,'' to the voting booth, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> wrapped up his speech by getting the crowd to repeat after him: `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> yes, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> no. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> yes, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> no. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> yes, justice yes, fairness yes ... Keep hope alive.''

 A pioneer in the fight against AIDS has quit the state AIDS <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in protest over Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>'s endorsement of an AIDS-reporting initiative, saying the governor does n't understand the AIDS crisis. Proposition 102, on ther Nov. 8 ballot, would require mandatory reporting to state health officials of positive test results for those infected with the AIDS virus. Officials also would be required to track down an infected person's sexual partners for the past decade and inform them they may be at risk. It is opposed by the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nurses </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. Opponents say the measure would inhibit voluntary testing and the cost would be exorbitant. Dr. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gottlieb </PERSON>, who in 1981 first reported cases of what is now known as acquired immune deficiency syndrome, announced his resignation from the state panel Monday. `` His -LRB- <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>'s -RRB- endorsement ignores the collective medical wisdom of the national and international experts whose strategies to fight this disease are already working,'' <PERSON> Gottlieb </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` I can no longer constructively work within the administration,'' he said. Two other committee members also resigned, <PERSON> Gottlieb </PERSON> said. They were appointed to the 11-member panel by <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>. The Republican governor on Friday released his stand on Proposition 102 and 28 other statewide propositions on the Nov. 8 ballot. `` This does not mean he will be campaigning on Proposition 102, nor use campaign funds nor his own time on it. It was merely an indication on how he will vote Nov. 8,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Beermann </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>. <PERSON> Beermann </PERSON> said formal resignations had not been received by the governor's office late Monday and the governor had not issued a statement.

 A gunman shot and killed a policeman today by firing into a parked patrol car and then hitting the officer as he got out of the car. When the gunman was finished, he apparently called the sheriff's office, police said. Officer <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, in his 40s, was found dead in a parking lot next to a service station, said Police Chief <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>. A man was taken into custody for questioning, authorities said several hours after the early morning shooting. They did not identify him. `` I found him dead beside his car and his revolver was laying beside him,'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. `` From what we can see, someone evidentally pulled up to the front of the car around 2:30 a.m. and shot through -LRB- Dean's -RRB- car 11 times'' with a high-powered rifle, the chief said. `` <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> tried to get out, dropped his revolver and they shot at him three or four more times.'' The police chief said investigators believe the man who shot <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> then called 911 `` and told them to get the sheriff down there. They asked who was calling, saying they needed more information and he told them, ` It did n't matter who it was. ... Get the sheriff down here, lady.''' The dispatcher thought she recognized the caller's voice and asked if that was who he was and `` and he said ` yes' before he hung up.'' The chief did not release the name of the man who apparently made the call. `` The first I knew about it was when I heard them trying to call Dean -LRB- on the police radio -RRB- and when they called him the third time and he did n't answer, I called the sheriff's office to find out what was going on,'' he said. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> then went to the parking lot and found <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>'s body. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> had joined the small town's police force less than a year ago, the chief said. <PERSON> Mize </PERSON> is in south-central <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, about halfway between <LOCATION> Hattiesburg </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>.

 The giant panda faces extinction unless <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> takes more steps to save the endangered species, a conservationist said Tuesday. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliot </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> conservationist of the World Wide Fund for Nature International, said at a news conference his group and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> recognize `` that what we've done so far is not sufficient.'' <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the only country where pandas live in the wild, estimates that fewer than 1,000 remain, threatened by deforestation and poachers who sell the black and white skins. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has stiff penalties for panda poaching, including the death penalty. <PERSON> Elliot </PERSON> said his group and the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> have come up with a plan calling for increased patrolling of panda reserves and better training for the guards. The plan is expected to be submitted to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, or Cabinet, next year, and `` it will be a blow if the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> does n't ratify anything,'' <PERSON> Elliot </PERSON> said.

 A newlywed whose four-month disappearance with her new husband drew national attention has been convicted of drunken driving and fined $ 350 for a September auto accident. <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> MacLean </PERSON> <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON>, 22, was found guilty Monday by <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Page </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>.

 Hollywood stars like <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, Barbra Streisand and <PERSON> Charlton </PERSON> <PERSON> Heston </PERSON> are grabbing the spotlight in this year's `` made for television'' campaign to hustle votes and big bucks for their favorite presidential candidates. `` For all concerned about the future of this country, this election is too important to ignore,'' says actor <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Begley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of the television series, `` St. Elsewhere,'' who supports <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Heston </PERSON>, who was prominent at the Republican National Convention that nominated <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for the presidency, `` is going to do whatever he can'' for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign, spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> said <PERSON> Heston </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Rooney </PERSON> and other stars `` are very committed to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> election. They're going to be at fund-raisers, do commercials and fly the flag.'' Celebrities are working overtime to get their candidates elected. They're riding on bus caravans to register voters, speaking at campaign rallies, making TV commercials and attending fund-raising events. Their support may be crucial to a presidential candidate, especially in a close election, because they can raise the enormous sums required to finance a television advertising blitz in the final weeks of a campaign. The star power of <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hope </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwarzenegger </PERSON> at a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> fund-raiser Sept. 13 helped raise $ 1 million for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee. <LOCATION> Chevy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chase </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> <PERSON> Midler </PERSON> were headliners at an Oct. 16 event for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, that reaped $ 800,000. By tradition, <ORGANIZATION> Hollywood </ORGANIZATION> is a liberal town. <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, an entertainment director for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign, told the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> he believes other stars who support <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> are n't campaigning publicly for him because they fear it might jeopardize their careers. That did n't dissuade <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON>, <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Ladd </PERSON> from joining <PERSON> Heston </PERSON> at the GOP convention. Other celebrities who have made post-debate appearances with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> include <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Norris </PERSON>, <PERSON> Telly </PERSON> <PERSON> Salavas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Love </PERSON> of the Beach Boys. At a Sept. 15 campaign strategy session at TV producer <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Lear </PERSON>'s home, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> greeted such supporters as <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION>, Streisand, <ORGANIZATION> Debra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Winger </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Judd </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Zappa </PERSON>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Keaton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Reeve </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fairchild </ORGANIZATION>. A month later, many of them took a `` Star Spangled Caravan'' bus tour of 10 cities in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to register Democratic voters. `` I like pure clean water to dive in,'' said <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bridges </PERSON>, star of the 1960s television series `` Sea Hunt.'' `` The environment is very important, but not enough is being done about it.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Redford </PERSON> has endorsed the Democratic nominee's environmental record in several campaign appearances Other <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supporters include <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Asner </PERSON>, movie director <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gere </PERSON>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor's Oscar-winning cousin, <PERSON> Olympia </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallone </PERSON>, star of the `` Rocky'' and `` Rambo'' movies, is a registered Republican but is publicly neutral in the campaign.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> likes to invite audiences to read his lips, but Republican conservatives and moderates do n't always agree on what he's trying to say. If elected, would <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> be as conservative a president as his recent campaign speeches indicate? Or would he revert to the moderate <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of yore who favored the Equal Rights Amendent, opposed a constitutional ban on abortions and dismissed <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s 1980 proposal for tax cuts as `` voodoo economics?'' Both sides are keeping their fingers crossed. `` Basically, he's more moderate than his image has been of recent years,'' says Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Vt </LOCATION>., a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> moderate `` I think some of the more conservative issues that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has brought to the forefront _ like abortion _ will be more on the back burner with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. ... That's what we're hoping.'' On the other hand, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON>, a political consultant who was a key adviser to conservative Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, says of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, `` He's actually run to the right of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on some issues, like abortion and so-called family issues. I think he'll be a conservative president.'' `` He's had eight years of experience, sitting to the right of the throne,'' <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> continued. `` He's really had a change of heart on a lot of key issues and is less moderate than he was projected to be in 1980.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, never accused of ideological rigidity, was a <ORGANIZATION> Goldwater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> in 1966 when he first ran for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> in 1980 when he first sought the presidency and a <ORGANIZATION> Reagan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> ever since. Views are mixed on what political stripes he will wear if he wins the White House next week. And political pundits are n't getting all that much guidance from the vice president's oft-repeated advice to heed the fractured wisdom of baseball great <LOCATION> Yogi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berra </LOCATION>: `` You can observe a lot by just watching.'' `` There's plenty evidence for either intepretation,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, a political analyst for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. `` The moderates think he's one of them: ` Good old <PERSON> George </PERSON>, we've known him for years.''' `` But he's also been running a tough ideological campaign, going down the line conservative on all the major social issues, hitting all the hot buttons,'' <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> said. `` And he's been going out of his way to please the Reaganites, including putting <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> on the ticket.'' `` He's going to have to choose which <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> he is _ the kinder gentler <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or one who says read my lips. He ca n't keep on doing this forever.'' Many <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> watchers suggest that, if elected, his presidency is more likely to resemble the middle-of-the-road policies of former <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> Presidents <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> and Ford than the ideological conservatism of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> or the more liberal wing of the party represented by the late <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON>. Still, <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, who was national security adviser in the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> administration and is now a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> consultant on international issues, says the vice president is likely to be a `` Rockefeller Republican in foreign policy.'' `` Tough, hardheaded, no illusions, more or less power-politics oriented, with somewhat of less ideological content,'' Scowcroft said in an interview. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in campaign speeches, has signaled a keen interest in negotiating further nuclear arms reduction pacts with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, seems less committed than <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to going full speed ahead with the `` Star Wars'' strategic defense shield, and has emphasized negotiating cuts in East-West conventional armies in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. On domestic issues, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has taken up the conservative banner and waved it, coming out strongly against gun control and in favor of the death penalty, urging a ban on abortions, talking repeatedly of the Pledge of Allegiance in classrooms and criticizing the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. But, at the same time, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has argued for stronger protection of the environment, has called for an increase in the minimum wage _ if accompanied by a lower minimum for young workers _ and has proposed a tax credit that could be used for day care. In addition, the men <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has surrounded himself with _ and who appear to be in line for key Cabinet posts in a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration _ tend to be moderates, many of them from the East. They include former <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, now the attorney general; <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment banker who is now the treasury secretary; former <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary and longtime friend <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, former deputy <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> economist <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldstein </PERSON>. `` It's looking like it's going to be an Eastern Establishment administration,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Viguerie </PERSON>, a conservative direct-mail specialist. If <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, who practiced a brand of non-ideological pragmatism both as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first-term chief of staff and as treasury secretary, were to become secretary of state in a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> presidency, as is widely assumed, that would complicate life even further for conservatives, <PERSON> Viguerie </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> over the years rejected confrontation with liberals. It would make a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration much more in tune with the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> administration, and we're concerned about that. We're apprehensive.'' Still, <PERSON> Viguerie </PERSON>, echoing sentiments of other Republicans of various political persuasions, says he does n't want to be a naysayer. `` I'm concerned about being negative at this point. I want him to have a massive landslide. And then, the day after the election, is when conservatives will speak out loud and clear.'' Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> moderate, says he expects <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to be staunchly conservative on budget issues `` in terms of restraining spending'' but more progressive on domestic matters. `` He's made it clear he will give a greater priority to day care, will be more environmentally sensitive. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> does n't wear progressiveness on his sleeve but is very likely to get substantial results,'' <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it had ordered home one of its warships in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, the first such reduction since this summer's cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war. Acknowledging earlier press reports, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> said the guided-missile frigate <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> had been detached from duty and ordered to sail for its home port of <LOCATION> Yokosuka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The frigate `` started out of the -LRB- Persian -RRB- gulf'' Tuesday, <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> said. `` There have been no attacks against shipping in the gulf since the cease-fire began -LRB- on Aug. 20 -RRB-,'' he said. `` This has permitted us to assess further the threat ... `` The cessation of hostilities, the lessening of the threat and the move to ` accompanying' as distinguished from the tight escort procedure has allowed us to reduce our forces by one surface combatant. But I want to emphasize that the departure of the <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> in no way reduces our commitment to the region,'' <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> added. His reference to the accompanying procedure referred to an administration decision earlier this fall to keep U.S.-flag tankers under loose surveillance whenever they sailed through the gulf, but to stop providing 24-hour-a-day escorts for every convoy. The <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' withdrawal leaves 15 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships inside the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and 10 in the nearby <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION> and northern Arabian Sea. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> has said it hopes to gradually scale back the gulf force to a pre-war level of about five ships if the cease-fire stays in effect. The <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> arrived in the gulf on Sept. 9 and was not supposed to leave for home until January.

 <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, wife of Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, was feeling better today after she was hospitalized for treatment of a viral infection, a spokesman said. `` I'm presuming she will not leave the hospital today. She will be here overnight,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Costello </PERSON>, her press secretary. Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was suffering a 102-degree fever and complaining of chills when she was admitted Monday night to the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. Costello said her temperature was nearly normal today. `` She slept well,'' he said. `` She slept five or six hours. The doctor said that is a good sign. Her appetite has returned.'' She was undergoing further medical tests today. Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, 51, is eager to resume campaigning and hopes to join her husband in <LOCATION> Waterbury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, for a joint appearance Thursday marking his 55th birthday, Costello said. `` Psychologically she'd like to be out campaigning, but physically she is not up to speed,'' he said. `` The last place she'd like to be seven days out from the election is in a hospital bed. Her husband was campaigning in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> this afternoon, but aides said he did not plan to interrupt his schedule to visit his wife. Costello said they spoke briefly by telephone Monday night. Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> underwent hospital tests Monday morning, rested in her <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, hotel room and was admitted to the hospital that night after dinner with her campaign staff and <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents. Costello said Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had been suffering from a sinus infection and had trouble sleeping Sunday night because of the discomfort. She is being treated by an ear, nose and throat specialist at the hospital. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, wife of Republican presidential candidate <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America'' show today that she was `` really sorry'' that Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was hospitalized. `` I hope she gets well and gets out right away,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>, wife of the 1984 Democratic presidential nominee, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>, sympathized with Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' plight. `` It's not just the number of cities at which you must appear,'' she said. `` You need to look strong and be strong, and you are strong, but your body can only take so much.''

<HEAD>Thatcher Off to Poland: Admired by Communists, Solidarity</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, scourge of British labor and `` Iron Lady'' to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, arrives Wednesday in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, where she is admired by its communist leaders and its banned Solidarity trade union movement. Adding to this paradox and increasing the diplomatic challenge of the three-day official trip, the Polish government said Monday it will close the <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> shipyard, birthplace of Solidarity, because it is unprofitable. At a monument outside the shipyard at <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> on Friday, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> is to lay a wreath with Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, an event the British insisted on as a pre-condition of the visit. Her domestic opponents charged that expressions of sympathy to <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> would sound hollow from the leader whose record includes eliminating thousands of jobs in the British coal and steel industries, and emasculating <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s once-powerful labor unions. Polish leader Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, in a British television interview soon after the closure announcement, heaped new praise on Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> for what he called her `` hard-handed implementation of total economic efficiency.'' `` We feel admiration for Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> for that reason, that she has pursued such a consistent and ... aggressive economic policy which has brought such results,'' <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> said. `` And I would very much like to ask for her counsel,'' the Polish <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief added, without apparent irony, of his imminent talks in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> with the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> prime minister, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s most right-wing leader since World War II. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s aides said she will argue to both sides that political and economic reform go together. Said opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> foreign affairs spokesman <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON>: `` Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> is an act of hypocrisy which the Poles will survive and forget.'' Either way, most British analysts saw the shipyard closure announcement as giving the <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> visit more political overtones than she bargained for, including possible anti-government demonstrations when she is in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> on Friday. The Times of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said <LOCATION> Polish </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>'s choice of the shipyard as the first big enterprise to go under a program of economic reforms `` will dull the moral and aspirations of people in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> no less surely'' than the 1981 declaration of martial law. `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> -RRB- signaled not only that the government would not allow Solidarity to interpret Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s visit as their triumph, but also that <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>'s days as a place of pilgrimage for Western leaders are numbered,'' the newspaper added in an editorial. The <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> trip is the centerpiece of the non-official engagements in a schedule reflecting both modern East-West politics and memories of World War II, which was began in 1945 when <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> declared war on <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> after <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> invaded <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Beginning with an official welcome by <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> on Wednesday evening, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, 63, has a hectic schedule. It includes talks with Cardinal <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s Roman Catholic leader; non-Solidarity government opponents or critics, including academics; wreath-laying ceremonies at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> and at <LOCATION> Westerplatte </LOCATION> where German forces invaded on Sept. 1, 1939. Between several rounds of talks with <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> and a state banquet, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> also will visit the grave of a pro-Solidarity priest, the Rev. <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Popieluszko </PERSON>, murdered by four secret policemen in 1984. It is a delicate mix of engagements carefully negotiated by British officials before the <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> announced the fate of the Lenin shipyard. Now, commented <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, `` Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> will be hard put to avoid being harnessed to Polish attempts to crush Solidarity.''

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s air force blasted <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrilla bases in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> on Tuesday, two days after a firebomb attack in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> that killed a Jewish teacher and her three children. Lebanese police said four people were killed, 15 wounded and several targets destroyed. They said all reported casualties resulted from a six-minute raid on the Mieh Mieh refugee camp at <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>. Israeli leaders had vowed revenge for the attack on the Israeli bus Sunday, in which five other people were wounded. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> frequently responds to attacks on its citizens by hitting Palestinian targets in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The raids came as Israelis voted in national elections expected to influence the fate of <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> living under military occupation. Police said the four dead at <LOCATION> Mieh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mieh </LOCATION>, on the fringe of the ancient port 25 miles south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, were three guerrillas and a civilian motorist driving in the Palestinian refugee camp. Two women and 13 guerrillas were wounded, they reported. Spokesmen for the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> gave the figures as three dead and 15 wounded. Both the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and police said they had no casualty reports from the other targets. Six Israeli fighter-bombers attacked <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> bases at <LOCATION> Mieh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mieh </LOCATION>, and positions of Syrian-backed guerrillas in hills above the coastal town of <LOCATION> Damour </LOCATION> and at <LOCATION> Aramoun </LOCATION>, a southern suburb of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Lebanese police said the planes were U.S.-built F-16s and a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> military report made available to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION> said they were F-15s. The Israeli command confirmed the raids, but followed standard practice of not revealing the type of aircraft. It said pilots reported the targets destroyed, including ammunition storehouses along the coast. Bases of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla faction in <LOCATION> Mieh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mieh </LOCATION> bore the brunt of the attack, police reported. They said the raiders fired eight rockets in four sorties that demolished four buildings used as bases by <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> 17 security agency. Flames shot up from from <LOCATION> Mieh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mieh </LOCATION> and the nearby hills of <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> el-Dilb. Ambulances and fire engines raced to the scene. Police said four rockets hit positions of pro-Syrian guerrilla factions in the highlands outside <LOCATION> Aramoun </LOCATION>, 10 miles south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, and two rockets struck a camp of three tents in a forest above <LOCATION> Damour </LOCATION>, midway between <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>. They said the tent camp belonged to the Democratic Front for the Liberation of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>. Its guerrillas and allied fighters of <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>'s Druse militia were seen firing at the raiders, without success. `` We heard the planes bombing <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, so we all rushed from the base to the woods,'' said one guerrilla, who would not give his name. `` That's why we suffered no casualties. Israeli jets broke the sound barrier over <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> before and after the raids. Tuesday's attack was the fifth inside <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in two weeks and the 20th this year. Thirty-six people were killed and 76 wounded in four raids on strongholds of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> and Iranian-backed Shiite Moslem guerrillas in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> between Oct. 21 and Oct. 26. Those raids responded to a suicide attack in which a Shiite driver detonated a car bomb Oct. 19 in an army convoy in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-designated south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> `` security zone,'' killing eight soldiers By police count, 104 people were killed and 184 wounded in the 19 previous air strikes of 1988.

 Republican vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> voiced irritation Tuesday over a sudden schedule change imposed by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign, saying, `` I wish I knew what my schedule's going to be.'' However, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, whose campaign stops were juggled so he would n't be in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bend </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, the same day as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, said it would make `` absolutely no sense'' for him and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to appear together Chatting with reporters outside <ORGANIZATION> Reynoldsburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> also showed frustration over his relative lack of attention in recent weeks. `` Actually I've been trying to create news for the last three weeks and I'm not doing a very good job of it,'' he said. `` Put me on the air.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and his aides had been asked by reporters Tuesday morning why he had canceled a scheduled trip to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bend </LOCATION> in his native <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> later in the day. He noted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s appearance at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Notre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dame </ORGANIZATION> and said, `` It makes absolutely no sense for the two of us to campaign together because they're -LRB- the Democratic ticket -RRB- not going to win the election.'' `` It's not good strategy, I'm telling you,'' he said. But the Republican senator also said, `` I wish I knew what my schedule's going to be. It keeps changing all the time.'' He said he'd told an aide to call <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> headquarters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> at day's end Monday to `` send the message back ... that yesterday was a great day and we hope to have more of them.'' When asked if he was intentionally conducting a play-it-safe campaign in the waning days, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> replied, `` They're not afraid of putting the two of us -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> -RRB- together.'' `` We've got plenty of time to be together,'' he added. `` But there's no reason for us to show up. I keep saying that. <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s wife -RRB- and I do n't even campaign together.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was traveling to <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> later Tuesday, but not to South Bend. He scheduled a steel plant tour in <LOCATION> Jeffersonville </LOCATION>, just across the border from <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, and was to go to <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, in the evening. A rough outline of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s schedule for the balance of the week showed him traveling to <LOCATION> Owensboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Stillwater </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Greensboro </LOCATION>, <PERSON> N.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said that while he feels he's been an asset to the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> ticket, `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> does n't need my help.'' He suggested that Democratic nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> picked Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> as his running mate in an attempt to carry <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> on Nov. 8. `` If you think that you have to have a vice president to prop up the top of your ticket, you're in trouble.'' he said. `` And that's what they're trying to do, to have their vice presidential nominee prop up the top of their ticket. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he has been focusing on the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> this week because <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` wants me to get out with the voters, get good regional coverage. And I've been trying to make news.'' On another subject, he said `` there's a difference of opinion'' within the American Jewish community about the Bush-Quayle ticket and the impact a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration would have on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` has been <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s best friend over the years, and I'm sure <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will as well.'' He described himself as `` very strong pro-Israeli'' and said that he had been there to encourage <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to join the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in a project to develop a missile defense system.

<HEAD>Denver Launches Oxy-Fuels Program, Better Air Campaign</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The governor took the bus to work and the mayor greeted commuters at a bus station Tuesday as <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> launched its fifth Better Air Campaign to combat carbon monoxide pollution produced by cars and wood stoves. Last year the campaign included for the first an oxygenated fuels program for vehicles, and <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> dropped from first to seventh place on the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s list of worst cities for carbon monoxide pollution. This year, the goals have been raised. Carbon monoxide levels in the mile-high city are highest during the winter, when cold air traps the pollution. And internal combustion engines work less efficiently in the high, thin air and emit dirtier exhaust. The Better Air Campaign encourages commuters in the six-county metro area to leave their cars at home at least one day a week and on high-pollution days until the end of January. It also calls for wood-burning bans on high-pollution days; some communities have mandatory bans and others appeal for voluntary cutbacks. The Air Pollution Control Division of the <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION> announces high-pollution days, and expects about 20 of them in the three-month period of the Better Air Campaign. Under the mandated high-oxygen fuels program, service stations along the <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Range </ORGANIZATION> will sell only cleaner-burning fuels blended with grain alcohol or a compound called MTBE, based on ether, until the end of February. This year the <ORGANIZATION> Better </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> hopes to reduce traffic by 10 percent and wood-burning by 8 percent on high-pollution days. Last year, it surpassed its goals by reducing traffic 9 percent _ or 3 million miles a day _ and wood-burning 7 percent. The oxy-fuels program last year cut carbon monoxide emissions up to 9.5 percent, and this year's goal is 12 percent. `` Last year, we saw for the first time that people in the area have internalized the need to reduce driving as an air quality measure, and in fact they were doing that across the board _ not necessarily when we asked them to do it,'' said campaign coordinator <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Grady </PERSON>. `` As a result we feel very optimistic.'' Gov. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> rode the one mile from the Governor's Mansion to the Capitol by bus. `` He wanted to show it's important for people to do what they can _ to say to folks, it's important, it makes a difference,'' said the governor's press secretary, <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Parmenter </PERSON>, who also took the bus to work. Mayor <PERSON> Federico </PERSON> <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> observed the start of the campaign by greeting commuters at a downtown bus station. <PERSON> Grady </PERSON> said the average car emits one pound of carbon monoxide every 11 miles. The average wood-burning stove emits one pound of carbon monoxide for each hour it burns. She said she expects this year's oxygenated fuels program to reduce carbon monoxide emissions significantly from last year because the oxygen content in the blended fuels has been raised from 1.5 percent to 2 percent. The drive also has been extended by a month. And whereas last year MTBE was the more commonly used oxy-fuel, the even cleaner-burning ethanol is expected to be used more this year, she said.

<HEAD>Epstein-Barr Virus May Trigger Rare Anemia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By A.J. HOSTETLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Epstein-Barr virus that causes mononucleosis also may trigger a rare form of anemia that can lead to death, scientists reported Tuesday. The DNA, or genetic code, of the Epstein-Barr virus has been found in the bone marrow of patients with aplastic anemia, researchers report in this week's Philadelphia-based Annals of Internal Medicine. In patients with that disease, usually young adults, the bone marrow quits functioning and fails to produce enough red blood cells to carry oxygen through the body. While unlikely to be a common cause of bone marrow failure among those who lack a history of infectious mononucleosis, Epstein-Barr virus, or <ORGANIZATION> EBV </ORGANIZATION>, must be considered as a possible cause of aplastic anemia, the authors wrote. According to the lead researcher, Dr. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Baranski </PERSON>, a hematologist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>, aplastic anemia afflicts about 200 people a year in this country, usually a few months after a bout of mononucleosis. Treatment requires drugs, and not all patients survive. The authors said the research suggests three possible mechanisms for how Epstein-Barr infects the bone marrow: _ The virus could directly attack and kill bone marrow cells _ It could cause the immune system to turn against the bone marrow, shutting down the production of blood cells _ Other viruses may aid Epstein-Barr in causing the anemia, as occurs in patients with AIDS, a disease involving a compromised immune system <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a pediatric immunologist at the National Jewish Center for Immunology and Respiratory Medicine in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, said the new research `` takes you one step closer'' to understanding the causes of aplastic anemia. He said the research eventually could lead to a form of therapy directed toward the virus or a treatment aimed at suppressing an immune system that has turned against itself. `` It could be that aplastic anemia is secondary to an overzealous immunosuppressive system,'' he said. The researchers began their study in late 1985 after treating a patient who had severe aplastic anemia following a bout of mononucleosis. Based on prior research, they suspected Epstein-Barr might play a role in the anemia and found traces of the virus's DNA only in the patient's bone marrow. According to <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> epidemiologist <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Niederman </PERSON>, who discovered that Epstein-Barr causes mononucleosis in 1968, almost all adults have been infected with it at some time. <PERSON> Niederman </PERSON> said the report published Tuesday confirmed researchers' suspicions that Epstein-Barr might play a role in triggering aplastic anemia. Researchers also have linked Epstein-Barr to chronic fatigue syndrome, the so-called `` yuppie flu,'' but the association between the virus and the syndrome remains unclear. <PERSON> Baranski </PERSON> said the researchers studied five patients treated for aplastic anemia at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and one at <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. All had traces of the virus in their bone marrow and several had experienced mononucleosis, he said. The researchers also reviewed the cases of 40 prior patients with aplastic anemia and other blood diseases and found traces of the virus, <PERSON> Baranski </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Economy Slowed Again in September, But No Recession Seen in 1989</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government said Tuesday that its chief economic forecasting gauge dipped 0.1 percent in September, the third decline in the past five months. Private economists said the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Index of Leading Indicators was signaling slower growth but probably no recession next year. The 0.1 percent September decline followed drops of 0.7 percent in both May and July. Often, three consecutive monthly declines have been the signal of an impending recession. But the latest declines have been interspersed with large monthly gains, including a revised 0.5 percent increase in August and a sizable 1.5 percent advance in June, the biggest gain since late 1986. After smoothing out the big month-to-month swings, analysts said the leading index was indicating a slowing of the robust economic growth of the past year. `` There is absolutely no question that the economy is slowing down,'' said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Chimerine </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> WEFA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, an economic consulting firm. `` The only question is whether this slowdown will lead into a recession.'' <PERSON> Chimerine </PERSON> said he believed a recession can be avoided over the next 12 months to 18 months, although he said this forecast could prove too optimistic if consumer spending slows more than expected or if the dollar comes under further sharp pressure from foreigners worried about the ability of the next administration to deal with budget and trade deficits. If foreigners suddenly decide they no longer want to buy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> debt, that would force <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates higher and could push the country into a downturn, he said. The recovery from the 1981-82 recession completes a peacetime record of six years this month and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is hoping this performance will persuade voters to keep the White House in Republican hands. While many economists once believed that the new president would face a recession in his first year in office, most are now predicting the downturn will not occur until 1990 at the earliest. The overall economy, as measured by the gross national product, is expected to expand at a robust 3.8 percent annual rate for all of 1988, the fastest pace since the last presidential election in 1984. However, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, predicted that growth next year would dip to around 2.3 percent. He said that forecast was in line with the signals from the leading index. `` We are looking for an economy that is slowing but not stopping,'' he said. Many analysts believe that a boom in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports, which has accounted for fully half of the growth this year, and business investment spending, another key sector, will both level off in 1989. `` 1989 is beginning to look pretty poor,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, head of a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> forecasting firm. `` The export boom is clearly gone, capital spending has tailed off and consumers have n't been too eager to spend either. That is basically the whole economy.'' In a second report Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said construction spending rose 0.6 percent in September to an annual rate of $ 403.4 billion as strength in housing and government construction offset a decline in office building. Construction spending for the first nine months of the year is just 0.7 percent higher than a year ago, a sluggish performance which analysts expect will continue because of widespread overbuilding of offices and other commercial space. The leading index, by focusing on forward-pointing business statistics, is designed to foretell economic activity six months to nine months into the future. For September, four of the available nine indicators flashed signs of a slowdown. The biggest negative factor was a drop in plant and equipment orders, which primarily reflected a drop in aircraft orders during the month. Other negative forces were a fall in building permits, a decline in raw materials prices and slower growth in the money supply. Falling prices are viewed negatively as a sign of lower demand. Five available indicators made positive contributions. The biggest boost came from an increase in the average work week. Other positive factors were a fall in initial unemployment claims, a rise in stock prices, a slowdown in filling orders and a rise in orders for consumer goods. The various changes left the index at 193.3 percent of its 1967 base of 100. Top policy-makers at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> met behind closed doors Tuesday to map monetary strategy for the next two months. Analysts said they expected no dramatic moves to boost interest rates, primarily because the signs of economic slowdown had eased fears that inflation was getting out of control.

 A man charged with starting a fire that destroyed a black church just as it was about to reopen after an earlier arson believed he was destroying a `` devil-worship church'' and was not motivated by racism, authorities said today. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON>, 19 was arrested Monday and charged with one count of arson. He was being held in the Madison County Jail on $ 100,000 bond, Sheriff <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchich </PERSON> said at a news conference. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bethel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> A.M.E. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fork </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Godfrey </LOCATION> has been hit by fire twice in six months, raising fears among its members that the crimes were rooted in racism. The more recent fire occurred Oct. 18, less than a month before the rebuilt church was to be rededicated, and left just one wall standing. After <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON>'s arrest was announced, the church's pastor, the Rev. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, said worshipers could `` breathe a little easier.'' `` We're elated. It's hallelujah time,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said Monday. Noting that the church was founded for religious freedom, he said, `` We ought to be able to worship in peace in 1988.'' <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> is white, but <PERSON> Churchich </PERSON> said racism was not a factor in the second blaze. There was no evidence that <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> was involved in the April blaze, he said. The night before the early-morning blaze, <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> was with friends and `` one of his buddies told him the church was part of a devil-worship church,'' the sheriff said. The church, founded in 1863 by blacks who had fled slavery, is located at the end of a gravel road in a remote, wooded area near a mostly white neighborhood in <LOCATION> Godfrey </LOCATION>, population 1,000. Last year, racial epithets were carved in the walls and swastikas were spray-painted on the church. Three men await trial in that incident. Elsewhere in southern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, four cross burnings have been reported since July on property owned by black families in predominantly white neighborhoods in <LOCATION> Belleville </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Fairview </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>. Authorities say they do not believe the crimes are the work of a single group.

 A year of stunning upsets has catapulted a 12-year-old Hungarian girl past fellow prodigies and could herald the end of male domination of chess. At the end of November, <PERSON> Judit </PERSON> <PERSON> Polgar </PERSON> will become the youngest player ever to gain the title of `` international master,'' which <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Garri </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> did n't achieve until they against leading male grandmasters. Men and women still play for separate world titles in chess and have segregated ranking lists. The current women's champion, Soviet grandmaster <PERSON> Maya </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiburdanitse </PERSON>, 27, ranks 79th in the world. In August, <PERSON> Judit </PERSON> became the world champion in the under-12 division after refusing to compete in a separate competition for girls. Romanian organizers presented her with a trophy for the `` world under-12 boys' championship.'' `` These other girls are not serious about chess,'' <PERSON> Judit </PERSON> said, polishing off a banana split during an interview in a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> cafe after winning the <ORGANIZATION> Duncan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawrie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mixed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chess </ORGANIZATION> Challenge this week. She defeated two grandmasters. `` I practice five or six hours a day. But they get distracted by cooking and work around the house,'' said the self-confident youth who sometimes shoots a piercing stare at her opponents across the chessboard. She says she expects to be in the top 100 players in the world when the new rankings are announced Jan. 1. The rise of <PERSON> Judit </PERSON> and her sisters <PERSON> Zsofi </PERSON>, 13, and <PERSON> Szusza </PERSON>, 19, is the story of a family that fought off pressure from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc officials and won permission to educate the daughters at home. Their parents, <PERSON> Laszlo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Klara </PERSON> <PERSON> Polgar </PERSON>, are teachers. Her father, a psychology specialist, believes children are capable of learning far more than educational methods will allow and should specialize very early. From the age of 5, each sister systematically has studied chess and languages. <PERSON> Zsofi </PERSON> speaks three languages in addition to Hungarian. `` It was an experiment and it is succeeding,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Polgar </PERSON>, who brought <PERSON> Judit </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Zsofi </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> for the <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrie </PERSON> tournament. <PERSON> Zsofi </PERSON> finished fourth in the 10-player field. The eldest daughter, <PERSON> Szusza </PERSON>, stayed in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> with her father. She was resting after finishing a half-point behind the winners in the world under-20 championship in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. `` My children are learning everything they need to know,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Polgar </PERSON> said. `` I wish I could have 10 more children. We could make the same results with them too. They do n't have to be special, only normal.'' The sisters wear jeans and sneakers, enjoy listening to pop stars <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, and play a table-tennis. Success in chess has taken the <LOCATION> Polgar </LOCATION> sisters to more than 20 countries, including <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. If <PERSON> Judit </PERSON> fulfills her potential, it also could turn the Polgars into millionaires. Corporate sponsorship has brought bigger prize money into chess. The 1987 world title duel in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> betwen <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> and fellow Soviet <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> featured a total prize fund of $ 1.85 million. <PERSON> Dominic </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>, chess writer in the Spectator, a British weekly, advised readers: `` Place a bet that by the end of the century, a woman will become chess champion of the world.''

He gave no count of the Scuds now in the hands of the pro-Moscow government. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON> promised to inform <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concerns. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has reserved the right to provide guerrillas fighting the Afghan government with equal firepower. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> declined to say whether that step would be taken. He again registered `` grave concern'' over Soviet arms shipments that he said were designed to bolster Afghan forces against a rebel offensive in the <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> region in the southeast. On Monday, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had used newly introduced MiG-27 ground-attack planes against advancing resistance fighters, violating a commitment to use its weapons only to defend Soviet troops. He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` views this augmentation of Soviet firepower in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> with grave concern.'' `` Such actions are inconsistent with Soviet undertakings not to conduct offensive operations except in defense of their own forces,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. `` We intend to take this matter up with Soviet officials at the earliest possible opportunity.'' Responding to a question at the department's daily news briefing, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has indicated all Soviet troops have been withdrawn from southern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. But he said officials of the Afghan <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> report that the Soviets have flown about 30 MiG-27 combat aircraft into <LOCATION> Shindand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` We believe this estimate to be accurate,'' he said. He said the MiG-27's, a class of aircraft never before used in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, arrived during the third week of October. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials believe the MiG-27, in operation since the late 1970s, has become the mainstay of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> ground attack fighter force. It is equipped both with bombs and an array of guns. `` Diplomats in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> report that the MiG-27s based at <LOCATION> Shindand </LOCATION> are being used in an effort to stem the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- resistance -RRB- advance on <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION>'' in southern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. The spokesman said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also is concerned `` about the use of Soviet aircraft based in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, including Backfire bombers, to bomb targets in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> area.'' He said the attacks began over the past weekend but that he had no way of judging their effectiveness or of estimating casualties. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said that although there has been a lull in the withdrawal rate of Soviet forces since midsummer, `` we still see no reason why the Soviets wo n't meet their obligation of February 15th _ for all of them being out.''

 The government Tuesday suspended a leading anti-apartheid newspaper as a `` threat to public safety'' in a move one of its editors said was an example of the arbitrary rule stifling <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The four-week bank against the Weekly Mail is the third time this year that Information Minister <PERSON> Stoffel </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> has suspended an anti-government newspaper. The other two papers since have resumed publication. `` One can endlessly guess and speculate as to what his reasons are but we're really dealing with arbitrary rule, one man's whim where he made up his mind all on his own,'' said <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Harber </PERSON>, co-editor of the Weekly Mail. Courts have upheld <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s contention that national emergency regulations do not require him to give specific reasons for his actions in controlling and restricting the news media. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> has sent several warning letters to the newspaper in recent months, saying it contained `` subversive propaganda.'' In a statement Tuesday, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said: `` The Weekly Mail continued with a systematic or repetitive publishing of matter which in my opinion has ... the effect of causing a threat to the safety of the public or to the maintenance of public order, or is causing a delay in the termination of the state of emergency.'' <PERSON> Harber </PERSON> said: `` We're planning for a strong return on Dec. 2.'' The paper's editors and lawyers were meeting Tuesday night to decide whether they can challenge the suspension in court. In the meantime, he said, `` We're going to be looking at other kinds of publishing work to keep things around here running. We're not going to be silenced. Since it was established in 1985, the newspaper has been a combative government opponent, with a reputation for excellent writing, aggressive reporting and sassy political commentary. Last Friday, the paper said <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s complaints focused on its coverage of security force actions and reports about outlawed organizations like the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement. Labor, human rights and political organizations condemned <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s action `` The state has not been able to silence The Weekly Mail through the courts simply because it realized the newspaper was not breaking the law. Instead Mr. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> has taken an arbitrary and reprehensible decision to close the newspaper for a month,'' said the South African Society of Journalists. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correspondents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> protested the move against `` a publication that is professionally respected and which undertakes its reporting in a responsible and lawful manner. Its absence from the local scene will mean the public will be denied a source of news and information that is extremely important to the national debate.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said it deplored the decision. `` It is the embassy's conviction that the press plays an essential role in any democratic society, and that press freedom, inconveniernt as it may be on occasion for governments, is nevertheless inseparable from democracy itself,'' it said in a statement.

 Twenty men, including a son of former President <PERSON> Gamal </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON>, went on trial Tuesday in connection with terrorist attacks on Israeli and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats. The trial opened with a boycott by most of the dozen-plus defense lawyers because security men kept them waiting for two hours. Also absent were the most prominent defendants _ a son and a nephew of <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s first president. Both are outside <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. The charges stem from four attacks on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Israeli diplomats by gunmen in speeding cars. Two Israeli diplomats were killed and six others wounded in shootings between 1984 and 1986. Two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats were wounded in a May 1987 attack. Once begun, the session lasted less than half an hour with Judge <PERSON> Emad </PERSON> <PERSON> Din </PERSON> <PERSON> Ismail </PERSON> merely reading out names of defendants and state witnesses. He also asked prosecutors to give lawyers easier access to the courtroom when the trial resumes Wednesday. It began with a circus-like atmosphere in a converted exhibition hall in a suburban <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> fairground. `` Long live <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s Revolution. God help the faithful and vanquish the infidels,'' chanted women and young men related to the defendants. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s Revolution is the clandestine group the main defendants, including <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON>, are charged with forming with the intent to commit murder. Other charges include murder and harming <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s security and its relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. If convicted, <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> and 10 others could be sentenced to death. The late president's nephew, <PERSON> Gamal </PERSON> <PERSON> Shawky </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON>, and eight others face complicity charges that carry life sentences. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s Revolution admitted all the attacks in communiques that opposed <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s 1979 peace treaty with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, criticized the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and professed the pan-Arab ideology nurtured by the late president. The young <PERSON> Nassers </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> six months before the indictment was announced in February. <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON>, the son, lives in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> and his cousin in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. In the courtroom, the 18 men on trial waited behind bars, answering reporters' questions and chatting with family members. First defendant <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Nour </PERSON> <PERSON> Din </PERSON> <PERSON> Sayed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Suliman </PERSON> told reporters <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON> had no role in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s Revolution. `` He was not aware of what we were doing. He was never funding us.'' The indictment listed <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON>, a professor at <ORGANIZATION> Cairo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, as second defendant after <PERSON> Suliman </PERSON>, who is a businessman and former administrator at the Egyptian Embassy in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> It specifically charged that <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON> was among three founders, financed the group and supplied it with weapons. The indictment accused <PERSON> Suliman </PERSON> of participating in all four attacks. `` I have done what I believe in,'' said <PERSON> Suliman </PERSON>. `` I never shot an Israeli or a Jew. I am only concerned with the <ORGANIZATION> Mossad </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said, referring to the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence agencies.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> used just three words to sum up his thoughts when asked why he was convinced Palestinians eventually will give up their struggle against Israeli rule: `` We will win.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> is a forceful man but not a wordy one. Silence is a habit from his many years as an underground leader fighting to create the state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and, later, as an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> secret agent. Aides say that his past surfaces in <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s penchant for secrecy and distrust. But once he trusts, he is a loyalist. He built his political career on a tenacious faithfulness to the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc. He is a believer in an <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> extending to the <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, and derides his rival, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, for willingness to negotiate away part of the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> in exchange for peace. `` There is no chance whatsoever that we would consider relinquishing control of <LOCATION> Judea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Samaria </LOCATION>,'' he tells Jewish gatherings, using the biblical words for the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. In one such talk, he suggested 9 million Jews should live in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, where the Jewish population is now 3.6 million. He insists there will never be a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state. The stocky, 5-foot-4 <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has tried to soften his image during the campaign under careful coaching by aides. The scowl beneath the bushy eyebrows is often a smile. Still, critics complain that the smiles do n't fit the words. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, 73, was born <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Ysernitzky </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Inspired by Zionism, he came to <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> in 1935 and changed his name to <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, Hebrew for `` thistle.'' He was quickly was drawn into the clandestine movement to drive out the British and establish <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> first joined the movement of <PERSON> Menachem </PERSON> <PERSON> Begin </PERSON>, who became his political mentor. But when the movement split, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> sided with the more militant Fighters for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s Freedom, known as the <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> gang to the British and the <LOCATION> Lehi </LOCATION> to Israelis, from its Hebrew acronym. When <LOCATION> Lehi </LOCATION> founder <PERSON> Avraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> was killed, <PERSON> Sharmir </PERSON> became one of the leaders of the group, the most ruthless of the Israeli underground cells. The group carried out the slaying of Lord <PERSON> Moyne </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> resident minister in 1944 in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, and was later blamed for the 1948 slaying of Swedish U.N Mediator Count <PERSON> Folke </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernadotte </PERSON>, who opposed including <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> in the state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. A recent report claimed <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> was present when the killing was planned. When asked about this, he replied: `` I do n't think I have to say anything about such questions. I'm not talking about the past, about what happened 40 years ago.'' After <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s founding, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> spent several `` unhappy years'' in business. From 1955 to 1965, he worked for the <ORGANIZATION> Mossad </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s secret service, living in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and traveling widely He says little about that period of his life. `` I changed names, passports and identities,'' he said in one interview. `` In various places, I would go armed.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> was recruited into right-wing politics by Begin, who became prime minister in 1977. Begin's loyalty to his old underground colleague raised <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> to speaker of Paliament, foreign minister, then prime minister when <PERSON> Begin </PERSON> retired in 1983. When the 1984 election was inconclusive, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> entered a coalition government with <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, serving as foreign minister. In 1986, in accord with the coalition agreement, they switched jobs and <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> became prime minister. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> opposed Begin's triumph, the Camp David Accords that led to peace with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in 1979. He said then he did not believe the Egyptians were sincere about peace. Ten years later, he says much the same thing about the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s moves to disown it terrorist past. Now, he says, peace can only come through the U.S.-sponsored accords he once opposed. They call for limited autonomy for Palestinians, with their final status to be negotiated later. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> recently told reporters the Palestinians' uprising against Israeli rule was `` useless'' because <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would never cave in to pressure. `` We will win,'' he said. `` If it takes time, we are a patient people. Notwithstanding the time it takes, we will win.''

 Guards used high-pressure water hoses today to break down barricades put up by prisoners demanding better treatment for homosexual inmates at the <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>. The 19 prisoners were placed in segregation units after the uprising ended this morning, prison spokesman <PERSON> Robey </PERSON> <PERSON> Eldridge </PERSON> said. No one was injured, he said. `` We used water hoses to force inmates away from the barricades against the wall,'' <PERSON> Eldridge </PERSON> said. `` At that point, we were able to enter through the doors and take charge of the situation.'' He said it took `` about 20 minutes of sustained water pressure'' to get the prisoners to back away from the barricades. The prison, located just east of here, was designed to house 476 inmates but had a record 1,065 prisoners today. A specially trained group of eight prison guards was assisted by about 40 other guards in quieting the disturbance, <PERSON> Eldridge </PERSON> said. Except for the water, no force was used, he said. The prisoners had presented a list of seven demands, including more equality and better-paying jobs for homosexual prisoners. The barricades were erected in Unit 2, a dayroom that had been converted into a dormitory, <PERSON> Eldridge </PERSON> said. A guard on patrol outside the dormitory noticed about 2:30 a.m. that a light inside the unit had been broken. Nothing was done about the light, <PERSON> Eldridge </PERSON> said, but at 5:18 a.m., a note was slipped under the door to the guards saying, `` There are people in here who want no part in this but we have no choice but to keep quiet and just stay uninvolved.'' Guards investigated further and found that the inmates had used bunk beds to barricade the door and would not let anyone inside, <PERSON> Eldridge </PERSON> said. About 6:30 a.m., the special guard unit began using the high-pressure hoses to force the prisoners away from the barricades and into corners of the dormitory. The meaning of some of the demands was unclear, <PERSON> Eldridge </PERSON> said, but at any rate prison officials had no intention of meeting them. He said complaints are considered only when prisoners go through proper channels. There had been no prior allegations of discrimination against homosexuals at the prison, he said, adding that the fact that someone wrote a note mentioning the subject does n't such complaints are widespread. `` I'm not saying this is a homosexual disturbance,'' <PERSON> Eldridge </PERSON> said. He said there are about 60 openly declared homosexual inmates in the institution.

 Construction spending climbed 0.6 percent in September as strength in housing and a rebound in government building offset weakness in non-residential construction, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday. Spending for new construction rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 403.4 billion in September following a 0.2 percent decline in August. Construction spending had risen 1.5 percent in July. Even with the latest increase, construction activity has been sluggish this year. The September level of activity is actually 0.5 percent below the level of a year ago. Weaknesses in apartment, office and shopping center construction have depressed building activity, although this has been offset somewhat by continued demand for single-family homes. Analysts said they expect this pattern to continue through next year. `` I think non-residential construction will soften further,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` We still believe that commercial and office buildings are overbuilt and there wo n't be a lot of oil drilling activity with oil prices as low as they are.'' For September, residential construction rose 0.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted $ 195.3 billion. That reflected a 1 percent increase in construction of single-family homes and a 0.9 percent rise in construction of multifamily units. Even with the latest increase, multifamily construction is 9.1 percent below the level of a year ago. Non-residential construction fell by 0.5 percent during the month, dropping to an annual rate of $ 91.7 billion. Factory construction was up 0.8 percent in September but is still 15 percent below the level of a year ago. Office construction dropped by 2.8 percent in September, and the building activity for hotels and shopping centers remained unchanged from August. Government construction climbed 1.8 percent to an annual rate of $ 78.2 billion, reflecting a rebound following a 3.2 percent drop in August. The increase came from higher spending for schools, housing redevelopment and sewers. Highway spending, the largest government category, was unchanged in September at $ 23.6 billion, 2.2 percent higher than a year ago.

 Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> is an ironic figure in Israeli politics. He wins popularity polls but often is booed and heckled when he takes to the campaign trail. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, 65, head of the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, is an intellectual, a writer whose honed speeches impress <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s middle-class, many of whom share his European background But his literary allusions and plays on words are sometimes seen as pretentious or even dishonest by Sephardis, the working class Jews of North African and Middle Eastern origin who make up most of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s voters. Aides cringed at a recent rally in a working class area when <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> referred to the artist <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Chagall </PERSON> to argue against a plan by the rival <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc that would give Palestinians autonomy without sovereignty. `` They say autonomy for people but not territory, as if people are suspended in air like in a Chagall painting,'' he said. In the campaign for parliamentary elections, <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> has been the target of stoning and heckling in towns populated by Sephardis, backers of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> headed by Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> has consistently outscored <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> in personal popularity polls. But voter surveys showed Labor and <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> extremely close on election day. The Labor leader based his campaign on trying to draw <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> into a dialogue within an international peace conference, to negotiate peace in exchange for giving up parts of the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. But he faces audiences worried about security and about the Palestinian uprising. Detractors also say <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>' backing for the international conference, which he once opposed, shows he shifts policies to suit his needs. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> is trying to regain the position he reached in 1985 when as prime minister in a coalition government he ended <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s three-year occupation of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and curbed triple-digit inflation He turned the prime minister's job over to <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> in 1986 under a power-sharing agreement worked out when neither Labor nor <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> gained enough votes in the 1984 election to form a government. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> began serving <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as an agent buying arms for the country's fight for independence in the 1940s. He gained stature among Israelis when, as defense minister in 1976, he was an architect of the raid to rescue Israeli hostages from <LOCATION> Entebbe </LOCATION>. Born in <LOCATION> Vishneva </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> immigrated with his family to <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> when he was 10. He Hebraicized his name from <PERSON> Persky </PERSON>, joined a Zionist youth movement and tasted life on a kibbutz, or communal farm. He married <PERSON> Sonya </PERSON> <PERSON> Gelman </PERSON> in 1945. He began his political career as a motorcycle messenger for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s first prime minister, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben-Gurion </PERSON>. Later, as <PERSON> Ben-Gurion </PERSON>'s deputy defense minister, <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> was the founder of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s arms and aircraft industries. From Ben-Gurion, <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> learned the art of political compromise and pragmatism, which are his trademarks along with hard work. He often works from dawn to midnight at what one aide called a `` murderous pace.'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>' practical approach is illustrated by his support for an Arab-backed plan for an international conference to resolve the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> conflict. He opposed the plan when he was prime minister, fearing a wide forum of nations would try to impose a settlement on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. But he changed his mind when he concluded that <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> would come to the peace table only under the umbrella of an international conference. The turnabout has been widely mocked by <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>' rivals, but his allies defend it as an example of flexibility that could lead <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to a peace treaty with an Arab neighbor. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> has written four books and studied for a time at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He once said that as a youth he thought of becoming a poet. `` Poets are truly wise men for they see the end and are afraid,'' he said. `` Politicians see a series of happenings. For if a politician could see how things end, he would stop struggling and quit the arena.''

 Hunters bagged 2,979 alligators and only reported two minor injuries during <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s first widespread gator hunt in 26 years. `` They did better than we thought, a fact probably attributed to the number of experienced trappers who were enlisted to help,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, a wildlife biologist for the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Game </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fresh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Gainesville </LOCATION>. Officials were pleased at the number of gators taken and the safety record among the 230 hunters issued permits for the hunt, which lasted throughout September. Only two minor injuries were reported. One man shot off his finger with a `` bang stick'' on <PERSON> Lake </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON>, and another was bitten on the arm, according to a preliminary report on the hunt. Commission officials had predicted the hunters would kill 2,600 alligators, or about 75 percent of the 3,450 limit. The hunt was called to promote interest in state wetlands and to trim the alligator population, which has doubled since anti-poaching measures were adopted in 1970. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> said regulations governing next year's hunt may be altered following a study on the 28 areas in this year's harvest. The hunt will bring the total alligators killed this year to about 8,000, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, a wildlife biologist with the commission. Nuisance trappers, who kill alligators that threaten people, destroy about 5,000 animals a year in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, where the animal's population is estimated at 1 million <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> has harvested more than 20,000 alligators every year since 1971. In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where hunts resumed in 1984, about 1,500 gators are taken annually. Despite the lure of profits for the gators, which can bring up to $ 1,000 per foot in meat and hide, the riches came mostly in form of memories. `` This was more for the experience than anything. It was a great way to see the real <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Gelardi </PERSON>, whose 13-foot-4, 770-pound gator was the biggest caught during the hunt. `` I think the game commission did a great job,'' said <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Sumter </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> nuisance trapper who took his 15-gator limit in 2 -LCB- nights. `` But this is the first year, when everybody was real cautious. As time goes on people are going to get more careless,'' he said. `` I hear people saying already that getting a gator ai n't nothing. Well, I've seen a gator crush my fiberglass boat like it was paper. All I can say is ` Be careful.'''

 Sinhalese rebels attacked an army camp Tuesday and escaped with munitions after a gunbattle that killed 12 people, state-owned radio and officials said. Military officials said 75 guerrillas attacked the <LOCATION> Pannala </LOCATION> camp in <LOCATION> Kurunegala </LOCATION> district, about 30 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, and carried away nearly 400 weapons and thousands of rounds of ammunition. The guerrillas arrived in two vehicles and overpowered the guards at the entrance to the camp, where most of the soldiers were sleeping, according to the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity. They said the rebels broke into the armory after a shootout. Killed in the cross-fire were four soldiers, four guerrillas and four civilians, said the officials. Authorities cordoned off the area and began a ground and air search for the attackers, who vanished into the coconut plantations surrounding the camp, police said. The radio said 75 arms were recovered in the search. The government announced a reward of $ 50,000 for information leading to the attackers. Authorities said they were guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, which opposes efforts by the Sinhalese-dominated government to reach an agreement with Tamil rebels. The island nation's ethnic Tamils have waged a five-year war against the government for a separate homeland in the northeast of this island nation. Indian peacekeeping troops were sent to <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> last year to try to enforce a July 1987 peace accord. Police said Tuesday's was the biggest raid by the Sinhalese rebel group since it began attacks on government supporters 15 months ago, killing more than 500 people. Sinhalese, who are mostly Buddhists, comprise 75 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people. Tamils, who are mostly Hindus like the majority of Indians, make up 18 percent of the population and say they are discriminated against in language, jobs and education.

 Three bombs exploded Tuesday in northern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, killing at least 23 people and injuring 64, police and witnesses said. Police blamed the blasts on radicals fighting for an independent Sikh homeland in the northern state of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. The radicals also were blamed for 13 deaths in <LOCATION> Pubjab </LOCATION>, raising the 24-hour toll in Sikh-related violence to 35, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> news agency. Two bombs exploded within 10 minutes of each other in <LOCATION> Pathankot </LOCATION> town, about 100 miles northeast of the Sikh holy city of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>, said Senior Superintendent of Police P.M. Dass. In neighboring <LOCATION> Jammu-Kashmir </LOCATION> state, a time bomb went off in a state-owned bus traveling from <LOCATION> Pathankot </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Jammu </LOCATION>, the winter capital of <LOCATION> Jammu-Kashmir </LOCATION> state. The blast killed at least 13 passengers and injured 34, said area police chief M.A. <PERSON> Anjum </PERSON>. `` We believe that the explosions were caused by Sikh terrorists to spread terror,'' <PERSON> Anjum </PERSON> said. A reporter at the site saw charred bodies scattered around the bus. `` The bus became a fireball after the blast. It happened all of a sudden,'' said a witness who refused to give his name. `` Fortunately the bomb was kept in the rear of the bus, otherwise many more would have died.'' In <LOCATION> Pathankot </LOCATION>, a motor scooter packed with explosives blew up outside a private medical center, <PERSON> Dass </PERSON> said. The scooter driver was among nine people who died instantly, he said. Other casualties included three women, two children and three men who were waiting for medical examinations. At least 25 people were injured in the blast, 12 of them critically, <PERSON> Dass </PERSON> said. The second blast was in a car. It killed one person and wounded five others. Victims were both Sikhs and Hindus. In <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, Sikh radicals shot and killed 13 people in four separate attacks across the rich farming state, Press Trust reported. Among them were six family members of a village chief. They were killed in a Monday night raid. Details of the other killings were not immediately available. Sikh radicals claim <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s Hindu majority discriminate against them. They began fighting a guerrilla war in 1982. Sikhs are less than 2 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 880 million people, but they are a majority in the <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. Hindus comprise about 82 percent of the people. Sikh militants have been blamed for the killings of than 2,150 people in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> this year.

 A teacher at an inner-city school has been charged with pointing a pistol at a 12-year-old boy who disrupted class by fighting and throwing rocks, police said. <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, an agriculture teacher at <ORGANIZATION> Middleton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Junior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, was charged Monday with aggravated assault and false imprisonment. The boy, whose name was not released, had been charged with trespassing. Colleagues said <PERSON> White </PERSON> had grown frustrated by the lack of discipline at the school and repeated vandalism of the vegetable garden he and his students tended at the school. On Thursday, two boys who were walking across the schoolyard got into a shouting match with a group of students who were standing outside with White, said police Sgt. <PERSON> Wiley </PERSON> <PERSON> Howell </PERSON>. As the two groups shouted at each other, they also began throwing rocks. One rock hit White, <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> said. According to authorities, <PERSON> White </PERSON> chased the boys in his car, caught one of them at a nearby street corner, forced him into his car and held a gun to the boy's head as he drove him back to the school. `` From what witnesses told us, he pointed a gun at one of the boys and told him, ` You are going to get into this vehicle,''' <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> said. White, 49, who was released on $ 2,000 bail, acknowledged chasing after the boys in his car but denied putting a gun to the youth's head `` The gun was never pointed at the young man,'' said <PERSON> White </PERSON>, who has been in the school system 22 years. `` I did nothing wrong. That's my belief.'' `` If I'm going to run a program out there, I've got to have discipline,'' he said. <LOCATION> Hillsborough </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> schools were conducting a separate investigation of the incident, said district spokesman <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidsen </PERSON>.

Most of the youngsters, 8 to 12 years old, were selected by the mayors of their cities from foster homes, orphanages, schools and programs for the poor. `` These are, basically, kids that would never have the opportunity to visit <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>, or even fly in an airplane,'' company spokesman <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridgway </PERSON> said. `` We wanted to do something special for <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON>'s birthday that was geared to kids.

An additional 4,000 children will attend <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON>'s birthday party at <LOCATION> Disneyland </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in a similar undertaking there. About half the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> group, including those from <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> cities, will be flown to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, the official carrier for the tourist attraction. The remainder will come by car. Delta is paying all transportation costs.

The company declined to estimate how much the celebration will cost. About 70 mayors or their wives will accompany the children, along with other chaperones.

 Young Palestinians hurled bottles filled with blazing gasoline into a car on election day Tuesday, seriously burning a woman whose hair was set afire and injuring the two other occupants. In the occupied territories, a general strike closed shops and halted most cars, taxis and buses. Arab reports said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers wounded eight Palestinians. At least 305 Palestinians have been killed and about 7,000 wounded since a rebellion began Dec. 8, 1987, in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in 1967. Ten Israelis also have been slain. The assault Tuesday in Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> came two days after firebombs set a bus on fire at <LOCATION> Jericho </LOCATION> in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, killing a mother and her three young sons in the worst attack on <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> civilians of the uprising. Five people were injured. Israeli leaders vowed revenge for the firebombing at <LOCATION> Jericho </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> fighter-bombers raided guerrilla bases in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> on Tuesday for the 20th time this year. Four people were reported killed and 15 wounded. In east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, the gasoline bombs were hurled Tuesday at a car festooned with blue-and-white <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> campaign posters and bumper stickers as it traveled through the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> neighborhood of <PERSON> Wadi </PERSON> <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> to a polling station in a Jewish area. Witnesses said the bottles of gasoline went through an open window and the car, with flames shooting from it, careened into a parked vehicle. An Arab witness, who gave only his first name of <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON>, said the woman `` jumped out of the car and her hair was burning. ... People ran from their houses to put the fire out.' <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Assis </PERSON>, 26, was one of the three people in the car. He told Israeli army radio, `` We were screaming because there were only Arabs around.'' The woman, identified as <PERSON> Yocheved </PERSON> <PERSON> Farbish </PERSON>, 23, was reported in serious condition with burns on more than one-third of her body. <PERSON> Assis </PERSON> and the other man in the car were treated at a hospital and released. Police said about 30 Palestinians were detained for questioning. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, leader of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>: `` There's an escalation in terror lately, and the terrorists in the territories are directed from outside.''

In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, the army set up roadblocks to enforce a 48-hour ban on travel to and from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> by the 1.5 million <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> residents. More than a dozen towns and refugee camps and towns were under curfew, confining 350,000 people to their homes, said the army spokesman's office. Stone-throwing confrontations with soldiers were reported in five towns and villages.

The marchers said they were yet to get relief after the Dec. 3, 1984, disaster. At least 20,000 people were injured when toxic gas leaked from a pesticide plant owned by the Indian subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> in the central city of <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION>. A five-judge panel headed by Chief Justice R.S. <PERSON> Pathak </PERSON> heard lawyers Tuesday for the <LOCATION> Danbury </LOCATION>, Conn.-based company begin preliminary arguments against the award. In 1986 the Indian government filed a $ 3 billion civil suit against <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION>, claiming the leak was caused by negligence. Union Carbide says it was sabotage by a disgruntled employee. A district court hearing the suit last year ordered <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> to pay $ 269 million to the victims of the disaster as interim relief. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company appealed to the high court of <LOCATION> Madhya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION> state, which lowered the payment to $ 192 million. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> now is hearing appeals by <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> against the payment and by the Indian government against the lowering of the amount.

He then collected tokens from passengers who usually entered the subway through a high turnstile, the spokesman said.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> signed a supplemental treaty Tuesday aimed at limiting emissions of nitrogen oxides, air pollutants that help cause acid rain and smog, the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said. Administrator <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> signed the protocol to the existing treaty on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution in <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, according to an agency announcement. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> earlier declined to sign a similar protocol dealing with sulfur dioxide, requiring a 30 percent reduction in emissions, on the ground that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sulfur dioxide emissions had been reduced substantially under the 1970 Clean Air Act. Such a requirement would have been unfair, when similar percentage reductions by European countries would be made from almost uncontrolled sources, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> argued. During negotiations on the nitrogen oxides agreement, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> sought a 20 percent credit for reductions already made that other countries had not yet undertaken. As a compromise, the agreement requires participating nations to limit emissions in the 1990s, but permits each to choose as its ceiling the emission level of any year through 1987. In addition, the annual average from 1987 through 1996 may not exceed the average for 1987. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s latest estimate is that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> motor vehicles, power plants and industrial boilers produced 21.3 million tons of nitrogen oxides in 1986. The peak year, which presumably the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could use as its base year when the freeze takes effect, was 1978, when <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> estimates emissions at 22.4 million tons. Forty-four percent comes from motor vehicles and other transportation sources, and just under half from industrial and power-plant boilers. Nitrogen oxides are produced by all combustion, particularly at high temperatures. Though new cars today emit only a quarter of what cars without pollution controls emitted in the 1960s, travel has increased so much that emissions have declined only slightly from the peak and <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> expects the total to turn up again about 1995, reaching 22 million tons in the year 2000. Participating nations are obliged to `` apply best available technologies that are economically feasible'' and to control existing sources `` taking into account such factors as plant age and rate of utilization and the need to avoid undue operational disruption.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> already has done that and thus `` no additional regulatory actions are required,'' <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said. Major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industries did not oppose <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> adherence to the agreement after <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> pointed out its judgment that no new regulations would be needed. Nitrogen oxides in high concentrations can damage the lungs. One of these compounds provides the visible brown component of urban smog. Transported long distances when emitted high in the air, as from a tall smokestack, nitrogen oxides become nitric acid and falls in acid rain. Nitrogen oxides are essential in producing the chemical reactions that make ozone, the major component of smog, and recent research has shown that even tiny amounts in forests may prompt the formation of ozone from hydrocarbons emitted by the trees themselves. In fighting urban smog, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has chosen to stress reductions in hydrocarbons from fuels and solvents rather than nitrogen oxide reductions. In certain circumstances, reductions in nitrogen oxides can increase ozone in the city before ozone concentrations start going down.

 <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> resistance leader Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> met Tuesday with a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official who said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> believes the prince should lead any new Cambodian government emerging from peace talks. <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> is the venue for talks this weekend between <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>. It will be the third such meeting in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in the past year. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, the former Cambodian chief of state, is informal leader of a coalition of three guerrilla groups fighting the <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> government and Vietnamese forces occupying <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Gaston </PERSON> <PERSON> Sigur </PERSON> met the prince. `` He reiterated American confidence in Prince <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s central role in that -LRB- peace -RRB- effort and our belief that he should lead any post-settlement government which emerges,'' the statement said. <PERSON> Sigur </PERSON> was to meet Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogachev </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on Wednesday to discuss <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and other Asian issues, it said. <PERSON> Rogachev </PERSON> also is in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> for the talks. The official Cambodian news agency <ORGANIZATION> SPK </ORGANIZATION> reported that <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> on Monday. <ORGANIZATION> SPK </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>'s main guerrilla opposition, the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> communists, was resisting efforts to exclude it from a major role in a political settlement. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and non-communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> boycotted the first two rounds of talks in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and evidently wo n't attend the latest session. The increasingly isolated <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> also did not attend multilateral discussions in <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> last month. There have been no breakthroughs. Peace proposals increasingly have focused on ways to ensure the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, the most powerful guerrilla faction, does not return to power. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> regime of <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kampuchea </ORGANIZATION> killed hundreds of thousands of people in its bid to radically restructure Cambodian society from 1975 until late 1978, when <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> invaded. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> installed the pro-Hanoi government <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> leads. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> radio said Sunday that the attempt to isolate the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> was `` not fair and not realistic.'' Without the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, it said, `` the possibility of a political solution is uncertain and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> would already have swallowed <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>.'' In a recent interview, <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> said there were two options: an agreement involving all factions, or one with <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s coalition. `` If the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> do not want to join the negotiations, then it seems to me indispensable that <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> might have to find a solution,'' he said. The framework for a political settlement has been established, <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> said. Only the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and its biggest backer, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, had rejected it. It was based on the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops, on excluding the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> from power, and halting outside military aid to the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has indicated it would not support the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> taking a dominant position in postwar <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Sigur </PERSON> reiterated President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s support for <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, `` for the non-communist resistance forces in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and for a negotiating process that can restore genuine self-determination to the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> people.'' `` Dr. <PERSON> Sigur </PERSON> expressed continued <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> support for <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s efforts to achieve a settlement in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> that will result in complete withdrawal of Vietnamese forces from that country, while preventing a return to power by the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is refusing to distribute the newsletter of its unionized <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>, mine safety and other field employees on grounds that it carries a flier for Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` One can not use departmental resources to advance any partisan political candidacy,'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Salem </PERSON>, the department's solicitor, said Tuesday. `` It's a violation of the Hatch Act. A Bush-Quayle'88 flier would be the same violation.'' `` You ca n't use department resources to advance a partisan politcal candidacy in that manner,'' he said. The 1939 Hatch Act restricts political activity by federal civil service employees. The four-page newsletter by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Field </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Locals </ORGANIZATION> was sent through the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s internal mail distribution system last Friday to the department's 10 regional offices. It was distributed in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> but was stopped in the eight other regional offices by <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> on Monday after he saw the three-inch, three-column flier _ essentially an ad _ across the botton of newsletter's second page. The flier, obtained from the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>, shows a picture of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his running mate, Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, with their arms in the air and says `` It's Time to Say Yes, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, a team for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s future.'' Above it, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Rios </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> compliance officer based in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and the local's president, wrote a 750-word article on the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>'s endorsement of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> under a headline: `` The Election: What it Means for Field Labor Personnel. In the article, <PERSON> Rios </PERSON> says the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s payroll has fallen from 25,000 employees to 19,000 during the eight years of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. The local, an affiliate of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION>, represents some 8,500 <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> field workers, primarily in the <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Rios </PERSON> said the article had been shown to Labor Secretary <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> last week and she had tentatively approved its distribution in the newsletter under an arrangement that has allowed the union to utilize the department's internal mail network since 1978. He said he had taken precautions in writing the piece to avoid advocating <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' candidacy and only report on the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>'s endorsement and the reasons that the labor federation gave for it

 <PERSON> Noah </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, host of the nationally broadcast `` Good Evening'' radio variety show that succeeded `` A Prairie Home Companion,'' will leave at the end of the year, <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> announced Tuesday. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> is returning to his career as a broadcast journalist, according to <ORGANIZATION> MPR </ORGANIZATION>, which produces `` Good Evening.'' He did not say for whom he would work. `` Good Evening'' will continue to be broadcast live from the World Theater in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION> each Saturday night to more than 160 American Public Radio stations across the country, <ORGANIZATION> MPR </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> was an anchor for public radio's news program `` All Things Considered'' before becoming `` Good Evening'' host in 1987. `` I'll be doing some radio work, I'm sure, and possibly television,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. `` And I have a couple of ideas for books that I'd like to explore. But I'll miss the music and stories and especially the excitement of Saturday evenings, close to air time.'' `` Good Evening'' replaced `` A Prairie Home Companion,'' with humorist <PERSON> Garrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Keillor </PERSON> as host. <PERSON> Keillor </PERSON> left `` A Prairie Home Companion'' last year and moved to his wife's native <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, then to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Beginning with the Jan. 14, 1989, broadcast, `` Good Evening'' will feature guest hosts until a permanent host is named, <ORGANIZATION> MPR </ORGANIZATION> said. `` We started thinking about this program early in 1987,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said in a statement, `` and we were pretty sure that good music and literature and storytelling could be brought together in a live broadcast from the World Theater that would find a substantial and appreciative audience. `` Now we're convinced of that. I think we've established a format that can continue for many years.'' `` It's been a wonderful two years here,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> WCCO-TV </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. `` I think of it, in a way, as having left someplace and gone to make a movie for a couple of years and made the movie and it's worked. And I do n't think they want to make it again for the next two years. I want to find some other movie to make.''

<HEAD>Algerians Vote In Referendum On Political Change</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SYDNEY RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Algerians vote Thursday in a referendum on political reforms proposed by President <PERSON> Chadli </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON> following riots earlier this month that left at least 176 people dead. <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> has a one-party system and the only legal party is the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. Bendjedid, who took over the presidency in 1979, has indicated he would phase out one-party rule and said approval of the referendum would be a major step in that direction. The proposal would require the president to name a prime minister who would head the government and be responsible to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. That is designed to free the government from the domination of the party. The president, who also serves as secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, presumably would no longer have complete control over the government. But the referendum does not legalize other political parties and both Communist and Islamic fundamentalist leaders have called for a boycott of the election. About 12 million voters in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>'s population of 25 million are expected to cast ballots and approve the proposal. There will be two other steps in what <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON> has called the `` greater democratization of political action.'' In late December a party congress of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> will meet to consider political reforms, but <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON> has not said what those proposals will be. Then there will be a second referendum, at an unspecified date early next year, on `` political and institutional modifications'' of the constitution. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that 1,500 people arrested during the riots would be released Wednesday. That would mean virtually all of the people detained during the rioting that began Oct. 4 and continued for a week would be free. An estimated 3,000 people were arrested and the government has said 1,500 have already been freed. The riots began during demonstrations protesting unemployment, a scarcity of staple commodities and rising prices. The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said 176 people were killed throughout the country during the rioting. Unofficial estimates put the death toll at more than 400. <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON> also has promised economic measures to deal with the crisis provoked by falling oil prices, although he has not said what those measures would be. <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> relies on oil for about 95 percent of its export earnings. The value of those exports has fallen by more than 40 percent since 1981 while <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>'s population has grown nearly 26 percent since 1980. Unemployment ranges from about 20 percent in the capital to 40 percent in rural areas.

 A Halloween mob barged through <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, battling police, shattering storefronts and looting businesses before police in riot gear and riding horses tamed the crush early Tuesday. About 100,000 people turned out on <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION> to celebrate Halloween, but only about 200 people turned to violence, police said. Twenty-eight people were arrested on various misdemeanors and felonies. Two officers and an undetermined number of civilians were injured in the brawl, a spokesman for police Capt. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Batson </PERSON> said. Damage estimates were incomplete. At the <LOCATION> Brown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Derby </LOCATION> restaurant, youths broke the front window and reached in to steal wine, said maitre d' <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintanilla </PERSON>. `` All the ghouls and the fools, it's just their day,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Cahill </PERSON>, who sought safety in the basement of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Billiards </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ebrahim </PERSON>, owner of the British Import shop, took insurance photographs of his security gate, ripped from the storefront and left mangled on the sidewalk. The shop's windows were shattered and showcases ransacked. The cash register and safe were emptied and much of his stock of T-shirts, leather clothing and jewelry was taken. He estimated looters took $ 80,000 worth of his $ 130,000 inventory. Shortly after midnight, Officer <PERSON> Fritz </PERSON> <PERSON> McDowell </PERSON> said, about 150 officers, including some in riot gear and others on horseback, were `` trying to take the streets back'' along a 10-block area. <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION> was closed to cars Monday night when traffic slowed to a crawl shortly before the violence began. It was reopened Tuesday morning. In other parts of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, police reported Halloween shootings, stabbings, a rape and incidents of suspicious candy. At popular <PERSON> Knott </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Berry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Buena </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, three teen-agers were attacked by a group of five people wielding broken bottles, said Officer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> McMillen </PERSON>. Two youths were hospitalized in stable condition with stab wounds and the third had facial injuries.

 The government and a decorated former <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> colonel whose bid to build a better anti-tank cannon went awry have agreed to settle multi-million dollar suits by victims of a 1986 explosion, attorneys said Tuesday. Lawyer <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S.J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Chernau </PERSON>, who represented one of the victims, said agreements were reached within the last two weeks, avoiding the need for a trial. <PERSON> Chernau </PERSON> said the explosion victims plan to seek a dismissal of the case against the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dilger </PERSON>, inventor of a 30mm cannon that accidentally discharged at an <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, filling station, blowing up a gas pump and injuring four people. <PERSON> Dilger </PERSON>, a weapons expert, was attempting to market the anti-tank gun to the Pentagon at the time of the accident. <PERSON> Chernau </PERSON> refused to reveal the terms of the tentative settlement, reasoning the other parties may not want to disclose the amounts. He said his client, former gas station employee <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, asked for $ 2.4 million and the amount she'll receive is `` not close to that.'' Two other victims sued the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> for $ 2 million. Lawyers for <PERSON> Dilger </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> confirmed a tentative settlement had been reached and also refused to disclose how much the <LOCATION> Xenia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, man and the federal government agreed to pay the victims. `` Until that case is dimissed by the court it is not a final deal. We ca n't say anything on it,'' <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said. In addition to the civil suit a separate criminal case also is near completion. <PERSON> Dilger </PERSON> has pleaded no contest to the misdemeanor charge of discharging a firearm in a public place. His sentencing, scheduled for Friday, had been postponed because <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> General District Judge <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON> wanted to see an effort made toward compensating the injured. <PERSON> Chernau </PERSON> said about 60 pieces of shrapnel were removed from <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>'s legs after the explosion. Her legs remain scarred and she has lost some mobility, he said. The other civil suit said <PERSON> Elda </PERSON> and <PERSON> Domenico </PERSON> <PERSON> Gargani </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> suffered extreme pain, mental anguish and shrapnel wounds after the eight-foot-long cannon fired a nine-inch shell into a gas pump, sending exploding metal into their car. <PERSON> Dilger </PERSON>, who won three <ORGANIZATION> Silver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stars </ORGANIZATION> and four Distinguished Flying Crosses in 180 combat missions in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, retired from the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in 1980 after establishing a reputation as a cost-conscious procurement officer. In addition to trying to develop a better, cheaper anti-tank gun, <PERSON> Dilger </PERSON> developed a stereo electronics business and until a year ago was a part-time weapons analyst for a congressional office.

 Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> has asked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> to intervene in a federal lawsuit accusing the state of failing to protect <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Okeechobee </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION>. The lawsuit probably would grow to include more than 50 defendants or other parties, take at least six years to resolve and cost at least $ 1 million, according to an analysis by <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>'s office In a letter he hand-delivered to <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> on Friday when both men were in <LOCATION> Gainesville </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> proposed holding conferences to settle the case out of court, the governor's office said Tuesday. `` While all of that litigation is taking place, the substantial enforcement efforts which my administration and other agencies have already put into place may be impaired, and intended new initiatives may be delayed or jeopardized,'' the letter read. On Oct. 12, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> filed a five-count complaint accusing the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulation </ORGANIZATION> of failing to protect water quality and prevent pollution, as required by state and federal law. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON>'s spokeswoman <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Cossin </PERSON> said her office had not received official notice of the governor's letter. `` Regretfully, we can not comment at this point,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Cossin </PERSON>, but added <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> probably would respond at a later date. The lawsuit seeks to stop pollution throughout the <LOCATION> Kissimmee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River-Okeechobee-Everglades </LOCATION> system, which includes a national park and wildlife refuge. <PERSON> Okeechobee </PERSON>, the nation's largest fresh-water lake outside of the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION>, has for years been receiving pollution, much of it in the form of nutrient-laden runoffs from dairy farms along the <LOCATION> Kissimmee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. The river, flowing from south of the <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> area, is a primary source of water for the lake. In turn, water from the lake flows into the <ORGANIZATION> Loxahatchee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION>, into Everglades National Park and to the water-conservation areas that recharge the <LOCATION> Biscayne </LOCATION> aquifer, southeastern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s primary water supply. Both state and federal laws are violated by allowing large quantities of polluted water to enter the protected areas, <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> has said. The state and the self-governing water district failed to maintain legal water quality standards, operated pumps without a permit and violated their contracts to supply clean water to the national parks, the federal suit claims. The <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> park provides sanctuary to rare and endangered species of wildlife, including the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> panther, southern bald eagle, woodstork, American crocodile and <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sable </LOCATION> sparrow, <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> said.

 A man accused of setting a fire that destroyed a historic black church told investigators he did it because he thought it was part of a devil worship cult, police said Tuesday.

I do n't buy that.'' Madison County Sheriff <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchich </PERSON> said <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> `` was actually convinced that it was a devil worship church. We have no reason not to believe his story.'' <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON>, 19, of <PERSON> Alton </PERSON>, was arrested Monday and charged with one count of arson after someone tipped off the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> fire marshal's office, <PERSON> Churchich </PERSON> said He was being held in the <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION> on $ 100,000 bond. The charge carries a penalty of three to seven years in prison upon conviction. `` I'm just tremendously pleased that this has been solved,'' <PERSON> Churchich </PERSON> said. `` I just wish somebody would come forth that would lead to the arrest of the other arson that happened in April.'' The church, founded in 1863 by former slaves who escaped the South, was rebuilt after an April 16 fire with a $ 65,000 fund-raising effort by its 25-member congregation. The sheriff said there was nothing to indicate that <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON>, absent without leave from the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, was linked to the earlier fire. <PERSON> Churchich </PERSON> said <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> told police he had been riding around with friends the night before the blaze and talk turned to Satanism. `` One of his buddies told him that the church was part of a devil worship cult,'' said <PERSON> Churchich </PERSON>, noting his department has received information about such a group in the area. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> charged that local officials did not want to admit racism existed. `` Our prayers are with <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON>, -LRB- but -RRB- I think he needs to tell the rest of his story,'' the minister said. Last year, racial epithets were carved in the walls and swastikas were spray-painted on the church, in the town of 1,000 across the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. Three men are awaiting trial in that incident. Elsewhere in southern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, four cross-burnings have been reported since July on property owned by black families in predominantly white neighborhoods in <LOCATION> Belleville </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Fairview </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>. Authorities said they do not believe the crimes have been done by a single group.

 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s foreign minister said Tuesday `` the world is waiting'' for <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> to respond to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan leading to Cuban troop withdrawal from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and independence for <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Leading newspapers said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> agreed to the gist of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal to grant independence to <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, also known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, within a year and let <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> troops remain in neighboring <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> for up to two years. South African forces would withdraw from <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> and U.N.-sponsored elections would take place. While not confirming the contents of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Roelof </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said Tuesday that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> had responded to it, and `` was prepared to be flexible,'' while <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> `` have yet to make up their minds.'' South African officials waited three days in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> for new peace talks to begin, but left Tuesday when it became clear that <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> had never sent delegates, diplomatic sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Gen. <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Geldenhuys </PERSON>, chief of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s defense forces, led the team. The South African <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoy <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON> canceled plans to fly to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on Tuesday when it became clear the Angolans and Cubans had not responded to the proposal he made in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> last month. <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON>, the assistant secretary of state for <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> affairs, mediated months of peace talks. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said he still hoped for an agreement, but in the meantime, `` We have taken a position that has now landed the Cubans and Angolans in the situation where the whole world is waiting for their response.'' Tuesday had been the target date for implementing U.N. Resolution 435, a 10-year-old document outlining the process for Namibian independence. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has ruled the territory for 73 years, and has previously linked its independence date to the departure of the estimated 50,000 Cuban troops supporting <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s Marxist government. South African analysts and diplomats in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> speculated that the parties are apparently awaiting the outcome of Nov. 8 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidential elections. <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> ANGOP </ORGANIZATION> news agency quoted President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> as saying, `` It's possible implementation -LRB- of Namibian independence -RRB- will begin some time in November, December or January.'' He was quoted as saying the Nov. 1 target date had been unrealistic. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has said he would end the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration policy of aiding the <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> _ <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Total </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angola </ORGANIZATION> _ rebels who have been fighting the Angolan government, and would not require Cuban withdrawal.

<TEXT>
 Soviet workers got a warning Tuesday that paychecks no longer will be guaranteed and loafers can expect trouble. It may have shocked those who follow the common Soviet practice of loafing on guaranteed jobs to learn that Politburo member <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Slyunkov </PERSON> said: `` Of course, socialism is a society of guarantees, but the guarantees are given under defined obligations. The situation must be corrected, to pay only for real results, for work, for quantity and quality of labor.'' Laziness has been a serious problem in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, where workers have been required only to show up, not to work. <PERSON> Slyunkov </PERSON> said the new system should be in place when the next five-year plan begins in 1991 and is critical to the success of President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s program of economic and social reform, called perestroika. Part of perestroika is the current attempt to determine the true cost of everything, an enormous task in a nation where bureaucrats have set prices for decades without regard to the labor and materials invested. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> put the country on a plan of cost-accounting a year ago. <PERSON> Slyunkov </PERSON> said Monday it must extend all the way down to the workers. Workers must be given `` simple and understandable methods of defining results and calculating expenses,'' <PERSON> Slyunkov </PERSON> said. `` People must see clearly that they receive everything they earn. `` The payment for the labor of a worker, a brigade, a collective is not now dependent on the ultimate results of work, on the product, its quality, the expense of material resources, on the timely delivery of products to the next brigade and workshop.'' Calculating paychecks according to such results `` will force men and collectives to work for the common good,'' Slyunkov declared.

<HEAD>Opponents of Official English Believe They'll Lose</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Opponents of a constitutional amendment to make English the official language of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> concede they already may have lost the fight. `` We'll probably lose at a minimum by 2-to-1,'' said <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Burkholtz </PERSON>, a pollster hired by two lawyers who are trying to fight the amendment, which goes before the voters on Tuesday. Lawyers <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Roof </PERSON>, who oppose Official English, hired <PERSON> Burkholtz </PERSON> for their campaign last summer. `` I had assumed there would be this vast array of dollars and fund-raising machinery,'' <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> says, `` and I was surprised to find it was not there.'' Defeating the amendment `` would have taken between $ 1 million and $ 2 million,'' he said. The two opposition campaign organizations _ English Plus, a predominantly Hispanic group focusing on <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and Speak Up Now for <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, a predominantly non-Hispanic offshoot aiming for a statewide audience _ together have raised a little more than $ 100,000. They already have spent most of that on consultants and staff. A statewide TV advertising campaign can cost as much as $ 500,000 a week. <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> and Roof, specialists in international law, are members of the <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, which they had hoped would provide a source of funds for the anti-amendment drive. Roof says that when defeat of Official English became one of the Chamber's announced goals, he figured funding support would follow. <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>'s firm in mid-June hired <PERSON> Burkholtz </PERSON>, whose own polling found public sentiment running 4-1 in favor of the amendment. His surveys showed that the margin dropped to a more competitive level once people had heard both sides of the issue. `` There was n't the quantity and depth of Latin support there should have been, even though there were notable exceptions,'' <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> said. Many Hispanics oppose the amendment as discriminatory. Proponents of the policy change argue that official acceptance of bilingualism has kept non-English speaking immigrants from assimilating culturally and realizing their full potential economically.

 A cadet hospitalized since his first day of police training six weeks ago was back in critical condition with brain hemorrhaging Tuesday, the city's mayor said. Cadet <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON>, 25, who earlier underwent a liver transplant, was rushed into surgery at midnight Monday to remove a blood clot, said Mayor <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Wojtkowski </PERSON>, who is acting as spokesman for the <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> family. Doctors removed the clot but have been unable to stem bleeding in <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON>'s brain, she said. <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> was one of 16 rookies hospitalized in the first week of training at the regional police academy in <LOCATION> Agawam </LOCATION>. The state attorney general, after a monthlong investigation, blasted the training Friday as a `` massive failure'' and said it was responsible for the kidney ailments suffered by 26 of the 50 cadets in <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON>'s class Staff at the <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> hospital where <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> was recuperating from a Sept. 27 liver transplant noticed he was unresponsive Monday afternoon and gave him a CAT scan, the mayor said. The scan revealed the blood clot. <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> has been on a respirator and unable to talk since he fell into a coma from heat stroke on Sept. 19. He emerged from the coma two weeks later but is still weak from a liver transplant, his family has said. `` He's in very bad condition, and I ca n't say anything right now,'' <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON>'s sister-in-law, <PERSON> Becky </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pittsfield </LOCATION>, said, sobbing. His parents have taken leave from their jobs to be with him and could not be reached. The Agawam academy came under scrutiny after cadets reported they were pushed to the limits of their endurance with hours of laps, push-ups and other exercises the first day of class on just a few small cups of water. The <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> met Tuesday to discuss Attorney General <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>'s report on the academy. However, association President <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Chmielewski </PERSON> said the chiefs decided to make no comment until they had thoroughly reviewed the report. <PERSON> Chmielewski </PERSON>, the chief of <LOCATION> Agawam </LOCATION> police, said Monday that the state police troopers who serve as physical training instructors at the academy had intimidated local police chiefs whose rookies have been trained there since 1984. `` They're a bunch of Rambos,'' the chief said.

 Twelve people were injured in riots Tuesday that began with a student protest over the killing of 14 fishermen by Venezuelan soldiers on the Colombian border. The fishermen were killed Saturday in a `` lamentable confusion,'' according to Interior Minister <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Consalvi </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials at first claimed the 14 were leftist Colombian guerrillas armed with automatic weapons, grenades, and explosives. <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students marched in a protest Tuesday that was interrupted by masked, rock-throwing youths, according to a <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> radio station. <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continente </ORGANIZATION> said the masked youths burned a delivery truck and smashed the windows of another before riot police appeared, breaking up the march and advancing on the rock-throwers. It was unclear whether the rock-throwers were involved with the marchers. The station said 12 people were hurt in the police roundup. An anthropology student and one of the masked rock throwers were hospitalized and 10 other people, with minor injuries, were released by police. No official confirmation was made of the number of injured. <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON>, governor of the federal district in which the university lies, condemmed the student protesters and called them `` social misfits who should be kicked out of the student movement.'' Student groups at the university said they would hold further protests over the shootings, in which 13 Venezuelans and a Colombian were killed by Venezuelan forces near <LOCATION> Guafita </LOCATION>, about 360 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>. Relatives of the dead men and two surviving fishermen said the group was on a picnic and were unarmed except for fishing knives when the troops fired. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> sources, who spoke on condition of not being identified, said those killed belonged to the <ORGANIZATION> Colombian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, a leftist guerrilla group, and planned to kidnap cattle ranchers and blow up Venezuelan oil installations. A <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said, `` The men were Venezuelans but they were subversives because they were armed. For us, it was a military action against subversives.'' A military court opened hearings Tuesday in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cristobal </LOCATION>, a regional center near the shooting site, that would `` investigate to the ultimate consequences,'' according to Defense Minister <PERSON> Italo </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Valle </PERSON> <PERSON> Aliegro </PERSON>. The two survivors, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wollmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinilla </PERSON>, testified Tuesday that they were involved in a simple fishing expedition when troops fired `` without any warning, just bullets,'' according to <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Marquez </PERSON>, a congressman who attended the session. The survivors denied any connection with leftist groups.

<TEXT>
 For seven years, <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> A Wish has been doing just that for thousands of needy youngsters, but this year burglars broke into the charity's office and stole away with children's holiday hopes, the group's founder said Tuesday. Over the weekend, someone made off with brand-new winter coats for 5-year-old <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> and 8-year-old Tyese, a jogging suit for 14-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Rochelle </ORGANIZATION>, a walkie-talkie for 11-year-old <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON>, laid up with a broken arm. `` Can you imagine someone taking children's coats?'' said <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Blair </PERSON>, founder and executive director of the not-for-profit organization that collects toys and clothing for needy children. Police said burglars broke into the office in a soon-to-be-demolished building downtown by prying open a window from an adjacent rooftop. Police Sgt. L.P. Yakutis estimated the total value of the stolen goods at about $ 1,000, and said police had no leads. `` The office was a shambles,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Blair </PERSON>. `` The used things they left all over the floor.'' The thieves also made off with items that had been donated for a fund-raising auction Thursday _ two tickets to a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Bears football game, gift certificates for dinners, theater tickets, the shoes of basketball star <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>. They also took office typewriters, telephones, an intercom and $ 95 in petty cash. `` I can understand them taking a typewriter or a telephone _ something they could sell,'' Ms. <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> said. `` But children's clothes ... we've got to grant those wishes again. Luckily, only recent acquisitions were in the office and many donated items were stored elsewhere, she said. In seven years of operation, Ms. <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> said the group had been able to fulfill almost 4,000 wishes for needy children. `` We work with children who literally do n't go to school because they do n't have shoes or a coat,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Blair </PERSON>. The children make their wishes known by filling out cards at schools and social agencies. In addition to essentials like clothing, wishes have been made for prescription glasses and cosmetic surgery to correct deformities. Every child whose wish is granted must write a thank-you note that is passed on to the volunteer who made it possible.

 Police arrested a man Tuesday who is accused of defrauding <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> by posing as a <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> priest and counseling survivors of a jetliner crash near <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> last year. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Irish </PERSON>, 47, faces charges in <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, of obtaining money under false pretenses in an amount exceeding $ 100, said Special Constable <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Clairmont </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Trenton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. An <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> warrant for Irish's arrest also accuses him of unlawful flight to avoid prosecution, said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouradian </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Wayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Irish allegedly defrauded <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> of about $ 1,100 in hotel and food charges while he posed as `` Father John Irish'' and counseled relatives of some of those killed in the Aug. 16, 1987 crash of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> Flight 255 at <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> Metropolitan Airport. Police arrested Irish at <PERSON> Copperfield </PERSON>'s Hotel in this eastern <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> city, where he had been working for several months as manager, <PERSON> Mouradian </PERSON> said. A detention hearing was scheduled for Wednesday in <ORGANIZATION> Belleville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Clairmont </PERSON> said. If extradited to <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and convicted of the felony fraud charge, Irish could be sentenced to up to 10 years in prison and fined $ 10,000, <PERSON> Mouradian </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Clairmont </PERSON> said police in <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION>, a city of about 15,000, had Irish under surveillance since July. He would not discuss further details of the investigation. <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ficano </PERSON> said several months ago that <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> authorities believed Irish might be hiding in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Witnesses and law enforcement officials said the man at the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> crash site distributed business cards for <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Brimmell </PERSON>, an attorney in <LOCATION> Deerfield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>.

Hopping on the name-game bandwagon of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his running mate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> campaigned in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and in his home state of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, assailing <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for acknowledging earlier this week that he was `` a liberal'' in the tradition of FDR, <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> contended that the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate `` is no <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>, and he's no FDR,'' tagging <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s rival with the `` Carter-Mondale liberal agenda'' of high taxes and big government. `` The opposition, even after finally admitting their liberalism, is still trying to deny that they've left the mainstream behind, and now belong to the party of -LRB- Sen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> and -LRB- former vice president <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> _ that's the type of liberals they are,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` No, the fact is that today, if you want <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to be what <PERSON> FDR </PERSON> called a ` great arsenal of democracy,' if, like <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>, you want to continue to help those resisting communism, if you believe in lowering tax rates like <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> did, and in the traditional values that you grew up with, then you should vote for our Republican ticket, because that's what we believe in, and the self-proclaimed liberals do n't,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> asserted. For weeks, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> have clubbed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with the ` liberal'' tag, insisting it carries with it policies of big government and high taxes, instead of the more traditional image of personal liberty and resistance to absolute government. The president also poked fun at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' populist slogan, ` I'm on your side,' saying: `` The liberals now are saying that they're on your side. I guess they think that that will make it easier for them to reach their hand around and put it in your pocket.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s comments came in remarks delivered at a rally on behalf of Sen. Chic Hecht, R-Nev., locked in a neck-and-neck race with the state's popular Democratic Gov <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>. At the airport rally, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> shared billing with a live elephant named <PERSON> Bertha </PERSON>, who carried a sign saying `` Stick with Chic.'' The elephant regularly performs at the Nugget, a hotel and casino in the Reno area. The rally, within sight of the foothills of the <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> mountains, began under a light cloud cover, but the sun broke through the clouds as <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON> was introducing the president. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told his <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> audience that `` there will be two Democratic governors who want to go to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'' on the ballot this year, dubbing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, `` the tax and spend twins.'' The president put in a plug for the staunchly conservative <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON>, who has suffered from an image problem due to sometimes awkard oratorical habits, but pulled lately within striking distance of <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>. `` Chic does n't grab headlines, he does n't showboat. Chic's the kind of senator who does n't make a lot of noise. He just gets things done for his state,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, pointing in particular to <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON>'s work on behalf of raising the 55 mph speed limit to 65 mph Nevadam with its four electoral votes, is firmly in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> camp. According to published reports, both <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON> planned to spend at least $ 2.5 million in their hard-fought contest, which pits <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON>, a former banker and clothing store owners, against <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, a highly rated state official. Earlier in the day, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took a final campaign bow in his home state of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Seeking votes to clinch the state for the vice president, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> tried to churn up votes in arch-conservative <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> at an exhuberant student rally at the local <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University-Fullerton </ORGANIZATION> campus. `` Do n't be fooled, folks, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s opponent is no <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>, and he's no FDR,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` Yes, it's the same Carter-Mondale liberal agenda they're pushing _ less defense, more big government,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, referring to former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and his vice president, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>, the man <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> defeated in the 1980 landslide election The president also stoppd in middle class <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernadino </LOCATION>, where he spoke at a state <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> rally near the famed Riverside auto racetrack. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> planned to travel on Tuesday evening to <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, where is he scheduled to add his prestige to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> campaign of <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Engeleiter </PERSON>, Republican leader of the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Public opinion polls show Mrs. <PERSON> Engeleiter </PERSON> trailing behind <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, the owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bucks </ORGANIZATION> basketball team. Before returning to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the president will campaign in another battleground state, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, appearing at <ORGANIZATION> Baldwin-Wallace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Says New Drug Offers Hope to Some Dementia Sufferers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN McGHIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A pharmaceutical company said Tuesday that in preliminary studies a new drug eased symptoms of dementia of patients whose condition was caused by blood vessel disease in the brain. If the drug denbufylline shows similarly successful results in larger trials now being conducted across <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> it may be available to the public by the early 1990s, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Poyser </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Beecham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceuticals </ORGANIZATION>. Dementia refers to the loss or impairment of mental powers. The most common cause is Alzheimer's disease. The new studies dealt with multi-infarct or cerebrovascular dementia, in which the blood flow to the brain is obstructed because of blood vessel disease. That causes perhaps 20 percent of dementia in the elderly and possibly another 20 percent includes both infarcts and Alzheimer's disease, American federal authorities have estimated. <PERSON> Poyser </PERSON>, <PERSON> Beecham </PERSON>'s research controller for <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, said the drug was tested on 110 patients with moderate multi-infarct dementia in two trials lasting three months each. For both tests, patients were selected randomly to receive either the drug or a placebo, he said. Neither patients nor researchers knew during the experiments who was getting the drug and who was receiving the placebo. In the first test, involving 50 patients, half were given the drug in dosages of 50 milligrams three times daily and half were given a placebo, according to <PERSON> Poyser </PERSON>. He said by the end of three months significant improvement appeared among patients on the drug in 21 of 22 tests assessing mental functions. Some tests measured specific cognitive faculties _ faculties such as perception, memory and judgment. Others used techniques traditionally employed by doctors and nurses to determine a clinical impression of a patient's condition. A second study involved 60 other patients. `` We added the control of lowering the dose to 25 milligrams for 20 of the patients and although there was little improvement for them, we found exactly the same success rate on the patients who were given 50 milligrams,'' <PERSON> Poyser </PERSON> said. `` We do n't want to raise false hopes. It will be another year before we know we have a really useful drug, but the early results are promising to say the least,'' he added. Dr. <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunbar </PERSON>, a director of <PERSON> Beecham </PERSON>'s medical department, said that although the drug would not reverse the brain's condition the hope was that it would enhance the brain's ability to use its spare capacity. He said patients who had taken the drug were `` more easy to live with, less disturbed, able to perform simple jobs around the house and use the telephone again. `` That may not sound a lot but in terms of dementia that is a marked improvement.'' Dr. <PERSON> Nori </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, chairwoman of the Alzheimer's <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, said she welcomed any drug that might alleviate suffering from dementia but she was cautious about how useful denbufylline might be to the majority of dementia sufferers. `` I am delighted that the results seem promising, but people with multi-infarct or cerebrovascular dementia, whom this drug is seeking to treat, are only a small percentage of those with dementia,'' she said.

<HEAD>Elderly Man Pleads Guilty To Second-Degree Murder In Wife's Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRIENDSHIP, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A 78-year-old man who shot his bedridden wife twice in the head and then swallowed a handful of pills pleaded guilty Tuesday to second-degree murder. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reinl </PERSON>, who was diagnosed with leukemia shortly before his wife's death, entered the plea in <ORGANIZATION> Adams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> as part of an agreement. He originally was charged with first-degree murder. <PERSON> Reinl </PERSON> told police he shot his wife and then took a handful of tranquilizers with a glass of wine on Feb. 8 after he realized that this was `` the end of the road,'' according to the criminal complaint. <PERSON> Reinl </PERSON> had been meticulous in the care of his 73-year-old wife, <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, who had suffered a series of strokes and was bedridden, <PERSON> Thibodeau </PERSON> said. He had been diagnosed as having leukemia and had lost 30 to 40 pounds around the time of his wife's death, <PERSON> Thibodeau </PERSON> said. He told police that he was unable to take care of his wife anymore and that he made the decision to shoot her and kill himself when she was in the hospital the last time before being released Feb. 2. <PERSON> Reinl </PERSON> had promised his wife that he would not put her in a nursing home, a defense attorney said. `` You ca n't help but have sympathy for Mr. <PERSON> Reinl </PERSON>,'' said District Attorney <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Thibodeau </PERSON>. Judge <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Gieringer </PERSON> ordered a presentence investigation and scheduled sentencing for Jan. 17. `` There was no agreement as to sentencing,'' said <PERSON> Thibodeau </PERSON>. However, the agreement enables defense attorneys to argue for probation as an alternative to prison. Second-degree murder carries a maximum penalty of up to 20 years in prison.

<TEXT>
 Family members of a missing Vietnam War pilot said the government has inflicted emotional distress on them by relaying a report that he was seen in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> and then immediately labeling it `` not credible.'' The family of Lt. Col. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> last month won a $ 632,000 judgment against the military for anguish caused by the misidentification of seven bone fragments recovered in 1985. The remains were recovered at the site of <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>'s plane crash 16 years ago in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>. The family filed a motion in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Monday to reopen that case `` in light of these further horrendously aggravating circumstances.'' The motion, seeking unspecified additional damages, was filed on behalf of the missing <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> navigator's wife, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION>; his mother, <PERSON> Vera </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> of Live Oak; and a daughter, <PERSON> Gillian </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The motion alleges that <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> has had to seek additional, intensified psychological and psychiatric counseling and has been placed on medication, a step she previously had refused to take. <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> received a phone call Oct. 13, seven days after testimony in the misidentification case ended, from Capt. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Pangman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casualty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Randolph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the motion states. <PERSON> Pangman </PERSON> told her the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> had received information that her husband and four other airmen, whom he declined to name, had been reported sighted alive in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Savannakhet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION>. A foreign national reported the sighting to the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Naval Attache's Office in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, on Aug. 22. <PERSON> Pangman </PERSON> then told Mrs. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> the report was being discounted because certain of the named servicemen, including her husband and another member of his crew, had been positively identified as dead. Yet, the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Graves </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Registration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> two years ago had rescinded that identification after an independent forensic anthroplogist working for the <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> family determined it was impossible to tell whether the bone fragments were <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>'s remains. American and Laotian officials recovered 50,000 bone fragments and personal items from the site where <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>'s AC-130 gunship went down in December 1972. The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> then positively identified all 13 of the plane's missing crew members, including <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, but <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> refused to accept that determination. The motion to reopen the case includes a copy of an Oct. 4 memorandum from Col. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlatter </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s Special Office of Prisoner of War and Missing In Action, and a teletyped message from <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agencies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Collection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Team </ORGANIZATION> Names of the other four missing men supposedly sighted are blacked out in the <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> message, but it does state all four are <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> men and that two were captains and two technical sergeants. It also identifies <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> as a captain, his rank at the time he disappeared. <PERSON> Schlatter </PERSON>'s memo states the source of the sighting information did n't have first-hand information but had obtained it from `` members of the so-called ` Lao resistance,' whom he does not further identify.'' <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, one of the world's poorest countries with four million people, was taken over by communists in 1975, and resistance elements exist among refugees in neighboring pro-American <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have increasingly pursued talks with <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>'s communist governments, however, in seeking information about MIAs <PERSON> Schlatter </PERSON> wrote that the report should n't be considered credible because some of the men supposedly sighted have been confirmed as dead. `` Further,'' he wrote, `` experience has shown that the Lao resistance are notoriously untrustworthy and they have repeatedly failed to provide even the slightest shred of evidence to back up their various POW-MIA claims.'' <PERSON> Schlatter </PERSON> wrote that efforts would be made to follow up on the report.

 <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> is the only state in which voters can cast their ballots for `` none of these candidates,'' and one critic says it's `` a cruel thing to do.'' `` I think it's a shame to have ` none of these candidates' beat a candidate,'' said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Haller </PERSON>, a Democratic state assemblyman from <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>. `` I know there are some candidates who sometimes are not the best in the world, but it seems to me this law has no effect other than to be an embarrassment to the candidate. `` It's a cruel thing to do to people,'' he said. `` Unfortunately, we can not have a write-in candidate in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. I think that's the proper approach.'' The law allows the option to be chosen only in statewide races. State Sen. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON>, a Democrat who as a state assemblyman introduced the plan in 1975, said it remains a valid method of expression that has n't been abused. <PERSON> Mello </PERSON> said he came up with the idea during the Watergate era when `` people were so disgusted with politicians they were n't going to go to the polls.'' `` It's a freedom of choice issue and that's what elections are all about,'' said <PERSON> Mello </PERSON>. `` Why should you have to go to the polls and vote for the lesser of two evils?'' <PERSON> Haller </PERSON> believes that if the law is going to remain on the books in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, then in fairness it should be extended to state senators and assemblymen as well. And <PERSON> Haller </PERSON> said that if `` none'' wins, then `` I would say that's a case where we would n't have an election But I do n't like it at all. The bad outweighs the good.'' There have been some embarrassing results. In the 1980 presidential preference primary, `` none'' got 22,493 votes, not far behind President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s 25,159 votes and more than the 19,296 votes Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., received In the 1976 Republican primary for what was then the state's only congressional district, <PERSON> Walden </PERSON> <PERSON> Earhart </PERSON> won the nomination with 9,831 votes but ran a poor second to `` none'' with 16,097 votes. Under the law, `` none'' ca n't actually win a race despite a majority.

<TEXT>
 When the ZZZZ Best carpet cleaning company hit Wall Street, the firm was in debt for $ 7 million and was in the control of mobsters, the company's whiz kid founder testified Tuesday at his securities fraud trial. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> said that a growing cadre of organized crime figures who claimed connections to the Genovese and <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> crime families dictated his every move in 1986 as he prepared a $ 15 million stock offering. `` I was just a front man for the mob,'' a tearful <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> insisted. The 22-year-old <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON>, who started his carpet cleaning firm at 16 in his parents' garage, is charged with 57 counts of securities, credit card and mail fraud. Ten other defendants have pleaded guilty. Accountant <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothberg </PERSON> is on trial with <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> charged with taking a bribe to hide ZZZZ Best's frauds. There were constant threats of death, <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> claimed, and `` I seemed to get progressively more threats the more stakes there were.'' Although <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> sought to portray himself as a helpless puppet of organized crime, he admitted that he became intoxicated with his public image and the millions of dollars that flowed into his firm. `` I had my Ferrari and I was the press golden boy,'' he said, bursting into tears. At the same time, he said, he was throwing up blood every night from beatings by the mob. <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> said he was conducting `` a road show'' to sell investors on the financial wonders of ZZZZ Best while the business was actually a fraud. `` It was important to puff up our income,'' he said. `` We were in the pricing stage of the public offering.'' To do this, he said, he took out $ 7 million in loans from <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hapoalim </ORGANIZATION> and others, and opened five branch offices. `` The offices were so we could show that we were the great ` 7-Eleven' of carpet cleaning,'' he said, referring to the convenience store chain. `` It was just so I could say to the Wall Street bankers, ` We're wonderful Buy our stock,''' he testified. `` And we were nothing. We were losing money.'' <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> said one time he bribed a bank officer $ 25,000 to get a $ 1 million loan. The officer was not named. As plans for the public offering of ZZZZ Best progressed, <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> said he was forced to take more loans, some made to fictitious companies which then paid the money to <ORGANIZATION> ZZZZ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Best </ORGANIZATION> so that the carpet cleaning firm had income. <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON>, seeking to deflate a prosecution claim that he was a skilled con man, is presenting a defense of duress, portraying himself as a young man in the clutches of the mob. He testified that once a mobster held his head underwater and another time he was kicked in the testicles for resisting the loan scam. Defense attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenner </PERSON> repeatedly asked <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> why he did n't go to police or try to escape. He said he was scared. `` I just felt there was nowhere to go anymore,'' he said. <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> named a long list of men he said participated in controlling his company but said the key figures in 1986 were the late reputed mobster <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Catain </PERSON> and two ex-convicts, <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Rind </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schulman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON>, the first witness for the defense, has been on the stand since Oct. 25. The prosecution rested its case on Oct. 21 after calling 47 witnesses and introducing thousands of documents and other exhibits.

The Soviets arrived in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> Monday under the terms of the U.S.-Soviet treaty to eliminate land-based, medium-range nuclear weapons with ranges of 300 miles to 3,000 miles. On Monday the team visited the other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cruise missile base in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Greenham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Common </LOCATION>, 50 miles west of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. None of the 96 missiles there is scheduled for removal until late next year and the last will not be removed until the final stage of the three-year treaty, signed Dec. 8, 1987. While the Soviet inspectors were at <LOCATION> Molesworth </LOCATION>, the eight crew members of their aircraft visited <LOCATION> Windsor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Thames </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> west of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Soviet inspectors first visited the two missile bases in July. The latest team is expected to return to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Wednesday.

 <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> pushed hard Tuesday to sell <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as someone who'll support a strong defense, and he worked to deflect any harm to the ticket from <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' acknowledgment that he was a liberal The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator hopped into the cockpit of an F-16C jet fighter at the General Dynamics plant in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, and told workers there the Dukakis-Bentsen team opposed the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration plan to reduce purchases of those planes next year from 180 to 100. `` <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> support a strong national defense,'' he said. `` The F-16 is an integral part of that,'' he said, pointing to the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> proposal for more conventional weapons instead of more spending on Star Wars and nuclear weaopons. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> continued emphasizing defense at a rally outside the courthouse in <LOCATION> Sherman </LOCATION>, where he told several hundred spectators that <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> commercials in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> claiming that the Democrats were going to shut down defense plants were `` absolutely untrue.'' The Democratic candidate stressed the same theme in <LOCATION> Owensboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, telling a crowd of more than 2,500 in a tobacco warehouse that the Democrats support the creation of the best military in the world. `` I'll tell you what a second-best defense system is,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. `` It has all the value of a second-best poker hand. All it does is cost you money.'' Joining <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> at the podium were <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON>, Sen. <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, D-Ky., and Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Natcher </PERSON>, D-Ky The rally ended with the singing of `` My Old <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> Home,'' and a balloon drop that did n't work. The rope to release the balloons broke and they stayed netted to the ceiling. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, questioned by reporters, brushed aside suggestions by reporters that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> hurt himself in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> by calling himself a liberal. Most Texans, according to polls, consider themselves conservative. `` He said -LRB- he was a liberal -RRB- ... in the terms of <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and a <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> and I do n't think anyone ever questioned their being for a strong national defense,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. `` You know, what you have to look at and read is how he stated it,'' he said. `` He talked about it in the terms of <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>, in the terms of <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, in the terms of balanced budgets, in the terms of paying your own way.'' The Republican administration `` talks about fiscal responsiblity and has n't given us a balanced budget yet,'' he said. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Slagle </PERSON>, the state <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> chairman who helped introduce <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Sherman </LOCATION>, said he did n't think <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did much harm. `` I do n't think it's really hurting him,'' he said. `` They do n't really attach that much to a label,'' he said, especially since <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> identified himself with <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> But <PERSON> Reggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bashur </PERSON>, the spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Bush-Quayle </ORGANIZATION> campaign in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, said `` calling himself a liberal, he's really hurt himself in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.'' Evidence of that damage was already showing up in tracking polls, he said. In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, he said, the term liberal stands for the <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> school of Democrats. `` I do n't know what his handlers were thinking'' when they let <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> say that, he said. After <LOCATION> Owensboro </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, where he spoke to a charged-up crowd of about 2,000 students jammed into a quadrangle at <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. He came to the stage with the speakers blaring <PERSON> Aretha </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>'s version of the <ORGANIZATION> Rolling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stones </ORGANIZATION>' `` Jumpin Jack Flash'' and he urged the students to get out and vote The Republicans, he said, were `` poppin those champagne corks but I'll tell you on November 9 they're going to have the worst hangover they've ever had,'' he said. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, a bomber pilot in World War II, clearly enjoyed the stop at the General Dynamics plant. Workers chanted `` <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, and several employees yelled out in objection to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, calling him a draft dodger. There were also <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supporters in evidence, but they did not heckle or disturb the tour of the mile-long plant, which manufactures about 300 jets a year. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> squeezed into the single-seat cockpit of a new F-16C for the cameras and afterward declared it `` fits like a wetsuit.'' He joked to reporters that he'd fly it to the next campaign stop and meet his entourage there.

 City officials say they may be swamped on election night because of a record 90,000 requests for absentee ballots that could add hours or even days to the final vote tally. `` People are afraid they'll have to wait in long lines at the polls, particularly working people ... and older people who are afraid they're going to have to stand in the polling booth for 20 minutes,'' said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, the former registrar and special assistant in the chief administrator's office. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s ballot is unusually long this year because of numerous complex propositions.

<HEAD>U.S. Votes Against Law Of Sea Convention</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The General Assembly on Tuesday voted in favor of the Convention on the Law of the Sea and for the sixth consecutive year the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> cast its ballot against the resolution. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has said the convention would infringe on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rights to exploit seabed resources. <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> joined the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in casting its vote against the resolution that urged all nations to ratify the 1982 convention. <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> is in a dispute with <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> over exploration rights in the <LOCATION> Aegean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. The resolution was approved by a vote of 135-2 with six abstentions. The rest were absent. Sixty nations in the 159-member assembly must ratify the convention before it would become international law. So far 35 countries have signed the pact. It would establish an agency to govern uses of the sea in international waters, traditionally an unrestricted area. The agency would deal with commercial disputes, protection of the marine environment, safety rules, anti-pollution measures and regulations against drug trafficking. Most of those provisions are acceptable to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The convention also states that the seabed belongs to all nations and it would restrict a single nation's right to explore or exploit resources. It declares that seabed production should not adversely affect the economies of developing countries, which produce the same minerals to be found in the sea, and an international authority would award production contracts based on trends in the world consumption of mineral resources. <PERSON> Noel </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gross </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> representative to the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, said that part of the convention `` runs contrary to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy and to that of others who share our views concerning the future development of resources on the deep seabed.'' `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its nationals, like other states and their nationals, have the legal right to explore and exploit deep seabed resources,'' she said. Such operations are legal under existing international law she said and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> intends `` to exercise these rights with reasonable regard to the interests of other states in their exercise of high seas freedoms.'' She said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also opposes funding from the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> general budget for Law of the Sea bodies _ the <ORGANIZATION> Preparatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seabed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribunal </ORGANIZATION> forthe Law of the Sea. Those costs should be covered by nations that have signed the convention, she said.

 The right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc and left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> dueled head to head in Tuesday's parliamentary elections with the small religious parties holding the balance of power. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> appeared to have the edge in forming a ruling coalition and said he was convinced he could stay on as prime minister with the help of the religious parties. But Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said his <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> still had a chance of luring religious parties into a Labor-led coalition. The election was widely viewed as a crossroads in determining the future of the occupied territories and shaping <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s policy for dealing with its hostile Arab neighbors. A <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> insurrection has gone on for 11 months in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, claiming the lives of more than 300 Palestinians and 10 Israelis. Labor advocated an international conference to talk peace with the Arabs and proposed sacrificing some of the occupied land for a negotiated settlement. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> opposed both. Intense negotiations were expected to take place behind the scenes Wednesday, with <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> leaders wooing the Shas party, projected to be the largest religious party with six seats. With 95 percent of the 4,800 polling stations reporting, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> was projected to get 39 seats and <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> 38 in the 120-seat <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION>, or parliament. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> and small right-wing parties together would have 46 seats. Labor and small leftist parties would have 56. That would mean that Labor and its allies would not have enough votes to block formation of a coalition between <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> and the religious parties, which appear more ideologically attuned to <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> and are forecast to get 18 seats. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television's exit polls predicted <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> would have an edge in forming a governing coalition. A smiling <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told supporters at campaign headquarters he believed <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> could get together a majority of 61 seats. `` Based on the facts we have before us, it seems that the situation commands and enables the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> to form <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s next government,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said in a nationally televised speech. In a later TV interview, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> opposed the idea of a national unity government like the one formed after 1984 elections ended in deadlock, with <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> winning 44 and <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> 41 seats. The 65-year-old <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, grim-faced, said at Labor headquarters his party was still in contention. `` The results of the election are not yet final,'' he said. He urged his followers, `` Let's not lose faith, and let's consider the options for forming a government in the next 24 hours.'' <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>, the defense minister and a leading figure in Labor, said `` the key to who will put together a government is in the religious parites.'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> noted that for <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> to win, it would have to join with the Moledet, or Homeland party. The party headed by former Gen. <PERSON> Rehavam </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeevi </PERSON> advocates transferring the 1.5 million Palestinians from the occupied lands to Arab countries. Labor officials noted that Rabbi <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Peretz </PERSON> of the Shas, a party oriented to Sephardic Jews of <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> origin, left the door open to a possible alliance with Labor. The 73-year-old <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> conceded that forming a government `` would not be easy'' and negotiations might last for days. In an obvious bid to woo religious parties, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> had never opposed a key Orthodox demand to limit religious conversions to those approved by Orthodox rabbis. The move could alienate American Jews, many of whom are Reform and Conservative. <PERSON> Amnon </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubinstein </PERSON> of the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Shinui </ORGANIZATION> blamed a Palestinian firebomb attack on Sunday for hurting Labor's chances. An Israeli mother and three of her children were burned to death in the bus attack in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Jericho </LOCATION>. `` I think the terrible, shocking event in <LOCATION> Jericho </LOCATION> had a big effect on the results,'' he said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. For the deeply divided nation of 4.4 million, whose 40-year history is a calendar of war and violence, Tuesday's election is a crossroad in the future of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> 21 years ago. Israelis voted in an atmosphere of violence created by the Palestinian rebellion coupled with a sudden outburst of attacks on Jewish civilians. About 80 percent of the 2.9 million eligible voters turned out, reflecting the galvanizing effect of the rebellion. A huge force of 13,000 police and other security personnel protected voting stations. The army sealed off the occupied territories, where the 1.5 million Palestinian residents conducted a general strike. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> and Labor have spent four years in a tenuous `` national unity'' coalition because neither could make an alliance with minor parties after the indecisive 1984 election. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> argued that the Arabs were ready for peace negotiations, but violence just before Tuesday's election undercut his position: On Oct. 19, a suicide car-bomb killed eight <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>; a firebomb attack on a bus last Sunday in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> killed a Jewish woman and her three sons; on election day, Palestinians in <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> hurled firebombs into a car carrying <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> campaign workers, setting a woman's hair afire. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> retaliated with four air attacks on guerrilla bases in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> after the car bomb, and made its 20th raid of the year Tuesday in apparent response to the firebombing of the bus.

 A Taiwanese man was convicted Tuesday on murder and robbery charges in a bloody street shooting that left two federal drug agents and two assailants dead. Su Re `` <PERSON> Michael </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Chia </PERSON>, 21, was not at the scene of the Feb. 5 robbery and shooting, but was an important figure in a drug deal that had been planned as a double-cross, prosecutors had argued. <PERSON> Chia </PERSON> delivered a gun, gave a ride to one of the alleged killers, and acted as a lookout for them, prosecutors said during his three-week trial. Jurors reached their verdict on their third day of deliberations. <PERSON> Chia </PERSON>, who could face life in prison, is to be sentenced Dec. 21. <PERSON> Chia </PERSON> was convicted in the deaths of <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agents <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Seema </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON> and attempted murder in the wounding of agent <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>. He was also found guilty of robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery. The undercover agents were shot after they agreed during a meeting at a <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> restaurant to buy $ 80,000 worth of heroin. They drove to a quiet <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION> street to conduct the transaction. However, two men got into the undercover agents' car and robbed and shot them, then fled to a waiting car where a third man drove them away, with backup agents and police in pursuit. Investigators later said the killers planned the double-cross robbery from the start and did not know they were dealing with <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agents. After a brief chase, the car was stopped in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marino </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sun </PERSON>, 17, and <PERSON> Wen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hui </PERSON> <PERSON> Kow </PERSON>, 27 were killed in a shootout. <PERSON> Win </PERSON> <PERSON> Wei </PERSON> `` <PERSON> William </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>, 19, was shot eight times but survived. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> is charged with first-degree murder with special circumstances that could lead to the death penalty if he is convicted. When police picked up <PERSON> Chia </PERSON> after the shooting, they found bullets, handcuffs, a clip that fit one of the guns used in the agents' shooting, and three ski masks in his car. `` He delivered one of the murder weapons the night before, and knew about the robbery plan,'' Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Clymer </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Chia </PERSON>. `` He knew about the robbery plan, and took <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> to the apartment of one of the other shooters.'' Defense attorney <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> contended that authorities lied and altered reports after <PERSON> Chia </PERSON>'s arrest to make their case against him.

 Leftist rebels launched a car-bomb, mortar and rifle attack Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> headquarters, killing four soldiers and wounding 37 people, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> reported. It said among the injured were <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> commander Col. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>, who received a shrapnel wound in a leg, and seven civilians. A broadcast by the rebels' clandestine <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Venceremos </ORGANIZATION> said the assault was a `` welcome'' to officers recently promoted in changes in the armed forces, including the new chief of staff Col. <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Emilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> assumed his command Tuesday. Col. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Galileo </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that rebel mortar fire set off grenades stored inside the main building in the compound during the 45-minute attack. Firefighters were able to extinguish the blaze, he said. The rebels also parked two cars loaded with explosives about a block from the guard compound in nothern <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and one blew up, a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. Army munitions experts deactivated explosives in the second vehicle, the spokesman said, speaking on condition of anonymity. He said eight of the wounded guardsmen were in critical conditon. No rebel casualties were reported. The National Guard is part of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s armed forces and takes part in counterinsurgency operations. <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> said the attack was carried out by commandos of the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, the umbrella group of five leftist guerrilla organizations. <LOCATION> Ponce </LOCATION>, speaking at the guard headquarters, told reporters that about 15 rebels took part in the attack, which he said was staged for its `` propagandistic'' value. The explosions panicked residents of the working-class district surrounding the headquarters. Witnesses said the car explosion damaged three buses, two other cars and two homes. Col. <PERSON> Leopoldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, the deputy public security minister, said rebel mortar fire destroyed two guard barracks in the compound. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> said the surprise attack `` does n't mean there was neglect by the security forces or the National Guard. What happened is, there is n't any way to stop a mortar attack.'' <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> said security forces were sweeping the area for rebels. National Guard officers interviewed at the site said they believed the 81 mm mortars were launched from an area known as <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lomita </LOCATION>, a hillock with some houses on it about 530 yards east of the compound. The rebels previously attacked the National Guard headquarters in January 1981, during their so-called `` Final Offensive'' against the U.S.-backed government. In March 1985, rebels attacked the National Police headquarters in the capital, wounding four police officers and three civilians. Military sources in <LOCATION> Sensuntepeque </LOCATION>, 50 miles northeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, said earlier that rebels attacked the prison there for four hours Monday night, but no injuries or escapes resulted. The rebel violence appeared to have no relation to the seizure of two guards and a nurse by inmates at a prison in <LOCATION> Quezaltepeque </LOCATION>, 15 miles north of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, the capital. Six inmates there demanded political asylum in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in exchange for the hostages' release, a prison official said. But he said the six are in prison for homicide or assault and `` have no reason to make political demands.'' <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdivieso </PERSON>, director of prisons, was negotiating with the inmates, his assistant director, <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Amaya </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuentes </PERSON>, said. Col. <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasconcelos </PERSON>, commander of the army brigade that has surrounded the prison, said the hostage-taking incident began Monday night when three prisoners jumped two guards and took their rifles. `` Three other prisoners have joined the rebellion and they are demanding political asylum in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Amaya </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuentes </PERSON> said. The six convicts controlled part of the prison Tuesday. The other 242 inmates remained in their cells. `` There are negotiations, but they do n't want to give up and they -LRB- threaten to -RRB- shoot the first one who comes near them,'' a guard said. `` They are willing to do anything.'' Soldiers with faces painted black surrounded the prison.

 <PERSON> Florence </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> <PERSON> Joyner </PERSON>, the fleet-footed, flashy-nailed sweetheart of the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> Olympics, made her acting debut Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> television comedy series `` 227.'' <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> <PERSON> Joyner </PERSON>, 28, winner of three gold medals and one silver medal in track and field at the Olympics, said in an interview before the show that she hoped to do more acting in both television and films. The world's fastest woman, better known by her nickname FloJo, played herself in an episode taped Tuesday night for later telecast on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. Her appearance had not been announced beforehand and she was greeted with thunderous applause from the studio audience. <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> <PERSON> Joyner </PERSON> acted in a scene in which residents of an apartment house were planning a fund-raising marathon to send runner <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Amakye </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION> to the 1992 Olympics. <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> <PERSON> Joyner </PERSON> appeared as a friend of <PERSON> Amakye </PERSON>, who competed in the 1984 Olympics but could not compete in the last Games because of a pulled hamstring muscle. In the script, a flirtatious character known as Jackee, played by an actress of the same name, tells <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> <PERSON> Joyner </PERSON>: `` I always wanted to meet the second-fastest woman in the world.'' <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> <PERSON> Joyner </PERSON>, whose flamboyant personal style is evidenced by her signature Dragon Lady fingernails and the one-legged bodysuits she likes to run in, said in a television interview before the taping that she hoped to make other appearances. She said she will appear on <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hope </PERSON>'s Christmas special in December. Her manager has received several movie scripts, including one from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. She said her role in `` 227'' was her first acting experience. `` I'm very excited,'' she said. `` I'm learning a lot. I'm learning the business ... I do n't think acting in front of an audience will be any problem for me. `` I've been rehearsing in front of a small group of people every day. I feel very confident with the people I'm working with. They've all been very nice I'm very comfortable doing this.'' At the Olympics, she won gold medals in the women's 100-meter and 200-meter races and the 4x100-meter relay. She also won a silver medal in the 4x400-meter relay.

<TEXT>
 One of three Palestinians who hijacked an Egyptian airliner in 1985 admitted on Tuesday that he killed two women passengers, an American and an Israeli. Lebanese-born defendant <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Rezaq </PERSON>, 25, pleaded guilty to seven of nine charges when his trial opened in a heavily guarded courtroom. The state dropped the two remaining, lesser charges of firearms use and violation of Maltese airspace to speed up the trial. Judge <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Gulia </PERSON> is expected to announce the verdict Wednesday. <PERSON> Rezaq </PERSON> was one of three Palestinian gunmen who commandeered an <ORGANIZATION> Egyptair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 flying the <LOCATION> Athens-Cairo </LOCATION> route on Nov. 23, 1985. Sixty people, including the two other Palestinian air pirates, died in the hijacking and the storming of the plane by Egyptian soldiers. <PERSON> Rezaq </PERSON> pleaded guilty to killing <PERSON> Scarlet </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogenkamp </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Oceanside </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>,. and <PERSON> Nitzan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendelson </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> woman. He had denied the charges in pre-trial testimony. The two women were forced to go to the doorway of the plane after Jewish and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> passengers were singled out. The women were shot and thrown from the plane to the tarmac. Conviction on the murder and hijacking charges could mean a life imprisonment sentence, <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>'s stiffest criminal penalty, for <PERSON> Rezaq </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rezaq </PERSON>, born in the <LOCATION> Sabra </LOCATION> refugee camp in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, testified that the hijacking was `` an act against <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s political system, an act against <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s policy which was destroying the future of the Palestinians.'' <PERSON> Rezaq </PERSON>, wearing a dark suit and a white shirt unbuttoned at the neck, said the hijackers had to land in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> because the plane did not have enough fuel to go elsewhere. `` We came to <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> in transit,'' he said while making a plea of mitigating circumstances. `` What happened in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> was an accident,''. <PERSON> Rezaq </PERSON> said the hijackers had intended to fly to an Arab country, which he declined to identify. Asked why the hijackers had fired at Israelis, <PERSON> Rezaq </PERSON> said, `` This is our principle.'' He said they fired at Americans `` because they are imperialists ... and there are other reasons too.'' Eyptian soldiers attacked the plane with gunfire and high-powered explosives. Most of the victims died from smoke inhalation in a fire touched off by an explosion, which a Maltese investigation said appeared to come after a hijacker tossed a grenade at Egyptian soldiers. Two victims were killed by gunfire from the Egyptians, investigators found.

 <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>'s population will more than triple by 2025, making it the fourth most populous nation after <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, according to a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> study released Tuesday. The west African nation was 10th in 1985 with 95.1 million people and will have 301.3 million people by 2025, passing the 300.7 million projected for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by that year, said the report called `` <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Population </ORGANIZATION> Chart _ 1988.'' `` The populations of <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> are growing more moderately than <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s, and of course in many countries in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> the population growth is almost stationary,'' said <PERSON> Rafeeuddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON>, the undersecretary-general who presented the report at a news conference. `` Each woman in the world has, on the average, 3.4 children...

<TEXT>
 Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> is calling for a $ 70 million emergency relief campaign to aid up to 2.5 million Sudanese in need of food, shelter and medical attention. The Sudanese were displaced by torrential rains Aug. 4-5 and subsequent floods, with the problem compounded by civil war in the south, pockets of drought and famine, locust infestation and the large number of refugees in the country. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>'s appeal, circulated in a document released this week, noted the plight of the displaced people fleeing civil conflict in the south. `` The condition of the displaced ... is appalling. The majority of those arriving in the camps are women and children; there are few men between the ages of 12 and 40,'' his report said. `` Many families have suffered personal attacks, family members have been separated and lost and most are in an extremely poor state of nutrition and health. `` There are large numbers of orphans or abandoned children above six years of age; few below six years of age have survived.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> began a rebellion in the mostly Christian and animist south in 1983, demanding greater autonomy and economic reforms. The Khartoum-based government in the north is primarily Moslem and has tried to institute Islamic law in the <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, including the southern provinces. Up to 200 families a day leave the south and head for the relative safety of the north, said the report. Perez de <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said these people were most urgently in need of help. He said August rains inundated more than 80 percent of <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>, destroying all the belongings of many people who lived in settlements in low-lying areas. Providing relief for all those needing it will cost at least $ 69.7 million, said the report.

 A federal appeals court on Tuesday rejected the Oneida Indian nation's claim on more than 5 million acres of land in central <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state stretching from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. The Indians were seeking to overturn the state's purchase of the land from their ancestors in 1785 and 1788, claiming those treaties violated an earlier treaty as well as the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law in effect before the Constitution was ratified. But the 2nd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, sitting in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, upheld a lower court ruling that found the treaties acquiring the land were valid. The Oneidas, joined by four of the five other tribes that comprised the once-mighty Iroquois confederacy, sought to overturn the treaties under which the land was sold. In lawsuits first brought in 1978, they claimed the land purchases were invalid because the individual states could not buy the <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION>' land without the central government's permission. In a 52-page opinion that quoted <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Madison </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> and other founding fathers, the 2nd Circuit described the appeal as `` unusual because it requires a federal court, perhaps for the first time, to determine whether actions of a state violated the Articles of Confederation.'' The Articles of Confederation, which left most power in the hands of the 13 states, were in effect for nearly 10 years after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> won its independence, before the Constitution was adopted in 1789. At issue in the <ORGANIZATION> Oneidas </ORGANIZATION>' lawsuit was a strip of land, 50 to 60 miles wide, running through the heart of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> from the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawrence </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> down to the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> border. The 5 -LCB- - million-acre tract included parts of 12 counties Lawyer <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> vanGestel </PERSON>, who represented the 12 counties, said this decision is expected to end one of the largest Indian land claims in the eastern <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and will also have a big impact on future Indian claims. `` Essentially, the court had to interpret the meaning of the Articles of Confederation and what they said is that ... the state did not have to get permission from the central government'' to buy land from the Indians, he said. <PERSON> Arlinda </PERSON> <PERSON> Locklear </PERSON>, attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Oneidas </ORGANIZATION>, called the ruling `` legally wrong and morally wrong.'' Reached at her <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, office, she said she had n't seen the opinion yet but expected to seek either a rehearing by the 2nd Circuit or to petition the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> for a hearing. She said the 13,000 Indians she represented had a `` strong moral claim: the failure of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to protect the <ORGANIZATION> Oneidas </ORGANIZATION> in their dealings with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state. Essentially the 2nd Circuit said the words of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> -LRB- in the treaty pre-dating the land purchases -RRB- were meaningless.'' The lawsuits were brought by the Oneida Indian Nation of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Oneida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nation </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and the Oneida of the Thames Band, of <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. One of the Six Nations of the Iroquois, the <ORGANIZATION> Oneidas </ORGANIZATION> were later joined in the suit by four of the remaining five: the <LOCATION> Onondaga </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Mohawks </ORGANIZATION>, the Senecas and the Tuscaroras. The sixth nation in the confederacy, which controlled much of upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> before the Revolution, is the <LOCATION> Cayuga </LOCATION>. The opinion was written by Circuit Judge <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> with judges <PERSON> Amalya </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kearse </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Winter </PERSON> concurring.

<HEAD>Strike Makes Mush of November Sweeps</HEAD>

 The November sweeps are here, but you would hardly know it. `` The National Love and Sex Test''? `` Inside the Sexes''? `` Goddess of Love''? This is not late-night cable, unfortunately, but real network TV shows scheduled to air this month. Normally in November, as in February and May, the networks load their schedules with top notch programming to help affiliates do well in local ratings. But this November still rattles with vacancies created by the writers' strike that ended back in August. At least the strike forced <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> to move up 18 hours of `` War and Remembrance'' to fill the void left by production delays on regular series. Otherwise, the networks are struggling just to get their regular schedules on the air, and most of the `` special'' programming is `` reality-based'' or standard movie-of-the-week fare. All this might well prompt the average viewer to ponder how late the video store stays open. `` This entire fall is a great opportunity lost to the networks due to the strike,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Poltrack </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' vice president for marketing. `` We're going to go from a sweeps that still has premieres in it, that has major extra programming, and from then go into ... all the holiday specials. We're not really going to have a fix on regular network product until January.'' <PERSON> Poltrack </PERSON> estimates network audiences, currently down from last season by about 8 percent, will end up down 5-10 percent for the season. If not for the effects of the strike, he said, network audiences probably would have been higher than last season, thanks to the Olympics, the World Series and the big-event `` War and Remembrance.'' <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for research projects, expects network shares, or the percentage of viewing audience, to be down a couple of points for the season, but does n't think the sweeps numbers will be that severely affected. `` I think November will certainly be a really good indication, other than for election night. We're definitely going to take a big hit. ... It may cost us couple of network share points, just that one night, on the entire sweep. It will certainly cost us at least one,'' <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON> said. On Tuesday, Nov. 8, the networks pre-empt their entire prime-time schedules so the news divisions can cover the election. There will also be paid political broadcasts taking up network time the day before. `` It's more of a two-day depressant than a one-day depressant,'' said <PERSON> Poltrack </PERSON>. `` War and Remembrance'' would be an anomaly in any sweeps _ 20 percent of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s prime-time schedule devoted to one program. It begins Nov. 13. The rest of the 32-hour epic will air in February. `` War and Remembrance,'' based on the <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Wouk </PERSON> novel, is a sequel to `` Winds of War.'' `` Winds of War'' was an 18-hour miniseries in 1983 that averaged a rating of 38.6 and a 53 share and became the third highest-rated miniseries ever. `` War and Remembrance'' will probably win the sweeps period for <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, but will have to contend with lower overall network viewing attributed to just the kind of `` grazing'' among channels that keeps viewers from committing to long projects. Although the miniseries is expected to get favorable reviews, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> executives have said it will likely end up costing the network $ 20 million. Otherwise, the only `` miniseries'' in November are a pair of two-parters on Nov. 6-7. CBS' is `` Internal Affairs,'' a sequel to `` Doubletake,'' starring <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Crenna </PERSON> as a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> police detective trying to solve a murder case. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> has `` The Great Escape II: The Untold Story,'' a star-studded made-for-TV sequel to the 1963 <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> McQueen </PERSON> movie about POWs. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> has put `` Wheel of Fortune'' letter-turner <PERSON> Vanna </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> into her own star vehicle, `` Goddess of Love'' on Nov. 20. <PERSON> Brooke </PERSON> <PERSON> Shields </PERSON> and Twiggy star in `` The Diamond Trap'' on CBS the same night. Then there is the mishmash of `` reality-based'' specials, a remnant from the writers' strike, since such shows are not subject to Writers Guild rules. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> has `` World's Greatest Stunts,'' `` <PERSON> Cary </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>: A Celebration,'' `` The National Love and Sex Test,'' a two-part `` Crimes of the Century'' and a <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> special. CBS' has `` Inside the Sexes'' and `` <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION> on TV.'' On Nov. 17, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> commemorates the 25th anniversary of the JFK assassination. On the actual anniversary, Nov. 22, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> has tastefully scheduled a TV movie called `` Spies, Lies and Naked Thighs.'' How late IS the video store open?

 In the rugged <LOCATION> Rogue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> of southern <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, the few people who had contact with <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehrer </PERSON> knew him as a man of few words. But when President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was assassinated, <PERSON> Lehrer </PERSON> took a pen and with a trembling hand but strong heart wrote a rare letter, to the first lady. `` I am just an old man living by myself way up in the mountains,'' he wrote. `` <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was the best president we ever had and you are the most wonderful woman in the world. Anyone -LRB- tries -RRB- to tell me different has me to whip. Twin fawns come in my yard to eat feed I put out for them. One's name is <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON> the other <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Lehrer </PERSON>'s letter is now in a special file at the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION>, created by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> from condolences sent to <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. Most of the 300,000 pages of letters, selected from about 3 million pages, are still being catalogued. But the couple hundred already on file reveal, in simple, touching and rarely mawkish prose, how deeply personal the Kennedy presidency and passing was for average Americans. There are letters from heads of state and celebrities, but most are from the likes of a self-proclaimed `` nobody'' housewife from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>; from a retarded boy in <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, who labored for an hour to print his 45 words; from a woman from <LOCATION> Ripley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, who said that because of <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> many Southerners no longer accept an old saying that `` a child born of a black mama and a black papa, his days will always be unhappy.'' The most frequent reflections are on JFK's vigor and humor, his efforts on behalf of the mentally handicapped and minorities, and his handling of the Cuban missile crisis. Some letters note special personal connections: <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Cagle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, for instance, whose life sentence <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> commuted three days before the assassination, and a crippled woman from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> whom <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> once gave a ride when he spotted her struggling to keep up with marchers in a parade in his honor. Several of the dozen letter writers contacted 25 years later had only vague recollections of what they had written Mrs. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. But memories of the assassination and the president were strong and little changed. <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Dills </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, had written at the age of 12 to Mrs. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>: `` When I heard your husband's speech that fatal morning I was glowing with pride because of the nice things he said about Texans. But now I am ashamed that I am a Texan. I wish I was not one.'' <PERSON> Dills </PERSON> is now a pediatric nurse who's back in love with her home state but unremitting in her devotion to a president and a period she believes `` was the last time people really felt proud.'' She recalled getting the news of the assassination while in physical education class. She cried. `` And then I remember a girl saying ` Good,' and -LRB- my -RRB- turning around and busting her one.'' <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, wrote as a high school senior that she was `` a bigot'' until <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> inspired her with his civil rights stands and other programs. And the riveting media attention given the assassination helped steer her to a career in communications. Now, as a producer and writer for a commercial film company in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, she says `` this current <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> scene is a very cruel comparison to what that was. ... We're all waiting for something like him to come back ... some part of us that feels if the right person would step out we'd have Camelot again.'' <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Chetwynd </PERSON> of Melrose, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>, `` This country simply turned around and got lousy when the both of them went,'' referring to <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and his brother, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>. Her condolences to the first lady included an account of her mother, a polio victim, once being given a ride by <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. `` It was the highlight of her life. She clipped and cut out everything in the papers about him. It was like he was her own boy.'' The letters to Mrs. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> often include notes like `` you'll probably never see this. But she read thousands of them, and notations on some indicate that `` JBK'' found this one or that one especially touching. In fact, it was Mrs. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> who promised almost 25 years ago that such a file, expected to be completed and available to researchers next year, would be created. She inspired many of the letters. Actor <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Keith </PERSON>, for example, wrote the day after Christmas 1963 that her courage had helped him and his wife when they lost a son nine days earlier. The letters also shared with her glimpses of the backyard tributes that went on around <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Mrs. G.W. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Deerfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, wrote how her 14-year-old son returned to a tree house he had long since outgrown. He raised a flag from a halyard there. `` And every morning in the cold dawn before school he raised it, lowered it to half staff, and in the chill afternoon quietly took it down.'' <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Biever </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nappanee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, wrote that `` our neighbor children named our favorite shortcut path <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lane </LOCATION>. We christened it and everything.'' A quarter of a century later, and now <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ludington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, she had little memory of the event, but she believes <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> `` was an influence in many of the major things of my life, such as being active and aware politically.'' At <ORGANIZATION> Peninsula </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Gig </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, teacher <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Crook </PERSON> wrote, `` The news came just before I was due to teach <PERSON> Shelley </PERSON>'s ` Ode to a Skylark.' -LRB- You were at the hospital. -RRB- Numb, cold, choked, I put it to the class: ` What do you do? Go home?' There was silence, and no face registered anything at all. Then a boy, very quietly, without waiting for recognition, said, ` No, we're Americans Let's do the work we have to do.''' An Indian chief from <LOCATION> Sun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, offered his sympathy and then said he had asked the great spirit of his people to provide `` plenty of soft spruce boughs for his rest at night.'' He also said that from now on, `` the gentle breeze will be his touch, the rippling of running water his smile, and the song of birds his voice.'' A few letters were sent to people in the administration. Reclusive author <PERSON> J.D </PERSON>. <PERSON> Salinger </PERSON> sent a telegram to presidential press secretary <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinger </PERSON>, no relation: `` My wife and I simply ache for an effectual way to send Mrs. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and the children our love and to say that we would be inexpressibly grateful for a way to be of some comfort or use to them. Surely everyone in the world must be heartbroken tonight.'' Some of the letters were just dropped off at the gravesite. One signed by `` Just Another American'' concluded, `` Good-bye my chief, my leader, my captain. Good-bye, my president. Good-bye.''

 With varying success, new video remembrances of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> reflect the magic and the fears of his 1,000 days in the White House. They're most effective when they show the young president speaking for himself _ in the witty repartee at news conferences, for instance _ and when they let real-time recordings register the grief at his death _ a reporter's voice breaking as he dictates from <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, a waiter sobbing into a starched napkin at the luncheon where <LOCATION> JFK </LOCATION> was headed that day. One-hour biographies can hardly tell a life story like <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s. In the end, these retrospectives seem to move too fast, missing milestones. In presenting his personal life, they show the outdoorsman sailing or playing touch football, the father cuddling his kids, the dashing husband of a dazzling wife, the portrait that made the Camelot myth. The tabloids' man of clay is nowhere to be found. Still, it's nice to hear a president straightforwardly admit a big mistake, as <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> does a year or so after the Bay of Pigs. It's nice to feel the energy of an administration that holds a summit with the Soviet leader within six months of taking office. It's nice to see, again and again, that oh-so-easy smile. Here are glimpses of the new videos:

 The most personal of the remembrances, this one used 200 hours of film and, at least as importantly, 300 hours of voice recordings, so JFK is heard narrating his life. At one point, as he's seen reviewing troops and meeting with advisers, the familiar voice confides: `` The responsibilities placed on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are greater than I imagined them to be; and there are greater limitations upon our ability to bring about a favorable result than I imagined. ... It's much easier to make the speeches than it is to finally make the judgments.'' There are lighter moments in the film, which will air on <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION> cable in November. During a televised call-in show when he's running for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, a caller suggests his wife would make a better senator. The smile. Then, `` I agree with that. But in any case, I have the benefit of her advice. So, maybe I'll improve.''

The script is full of detail: the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> had checked the table decorations at the luncheon <LOCATION> JFK </LOCATION> was going to and would select his steak at random from 2,500.

JFK built up troop numbers in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> but took the first steps toward co-existence with the Soviets.

 It was just about sunset when the man from the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Authority </LOCATION> drove by and spied the farmer sitting on a knoll off to the side of the country road. The time was the early 1940s, and the farmer was just sitting there, staring at his farm in the hollow _ the house, barn and smokehouse, all aglow with light. It was obviously the darnedest thing the farmer had ever seen. A few days later, the <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> man was attending church when the same farmer stood to address the congregation. `` Brothers and sisters, I want to tell you this. The greatest thing on earth is to have the love of God in your heart,'' the farmer declared. `` And the next greatest thing is to have electricity in your house.'' Stories like this still bring a smile at <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Authority </LOCATION> offices in <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chattanooga </LOCATION> and Muscle Shoals. They're a wistful reminder of the good old days. Once <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> was the savior of the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, a shining model of how government can develop a region, the agency that switched on lights from <LOCATION> Asheville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Tupelo </LOCATION>, Miss. In addition to cheap electricity, <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> provided jobs building dams during the Great Depression, lured industry by opening the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> to navigation and improved poor farming practices. `` In our household, <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> was just considered wonderful,'' the agency's former chairman, <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, who grew up in <LOCATION> Chattanooga </LOCATION>, reminisced a few years back. `` <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> was right up there with religion _ and I came from a religious family.'' But the good old days are gone. Now <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Deal </LOCATION> dream is an agency in transition _ some say shambles _ struggling to undo decades of bloated bureaucracy, inefficiency and poor leadership. <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> is the largest electric utility in the country, capable of producing more than 31 million kilowatts from 29 hydroelectric plants, 12 coal-fired steam plants, four combustion turbines and one nuclear plant. It serves 8 million people over 80,000 square miles of the South. That's almost all of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, a third of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, a quarter of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and smaller parts of <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. But the federal agency, which started with a $ 100 million government loan in 1933, also faces a debt of $ 17.9 billion, almost all of it from what was once the nation's most ambitious nuclear power program. Of the 17 reactors that <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> planned or started from 1966 to 1978, only one, Unit 2 at <ORGANIZATION> Sequoyah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> outside <LOCATION> Chattanooga </LOCATION>, is generating electricity today. Eight were scrapped in the early 1980s after <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> realized it had misjudged how much power it needed. Four were delayed by tougher and costly safety regulations after the Three Mile Island accident in 1979. And the five licensed by the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> were shut down in 1985 over concerns they could not be operated safely after accumulating more than $ 1 million in <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> fines the previous five years. <ORGANIZATION> Sequoyah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION> 2 returned to action only in May, and <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> puts the bill to bring all five reactors back on line at $ 1.5 billion, and still counting. That does n't include lost revenue _ about $ 1 million a day when all five units were down. None of which helped <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION>'s electric rates, which after years of being among the cheapest in the country increased more than 500 percent from 1967 to 1982. The rates are still well below the nation's most expensive, but many cities, including <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, have lower industrial power rates. `` It has been too easy for us,'' <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Runyon </PERSON> said of the agency's past willingness to pass its costs along to customers. `` We're going to stop that. `` We could raise rates and continue to raise rates. But the fact is, <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> used to be the yardstick for the cost of power in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ... and we've lost it. We've got to get it back.'' <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION>'s problems go back at least to 1959, when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> authorized the agency to begin financing its power operation with electricity sales, instead of federal appropriations. From World War II through the mid-1960s, power use by <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> customers had climbed about 7 percent a year, but rising coal prices and air pollution problems seemed to warrant against more coal-fired plants. With the freedom to borrow from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> turned to nuclear power, both cleaner and apparently cheaper than coal, starting construction on seven plants in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. But by 1983, electricity use was growing just 1 percent a year, and <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> decided it was building more nuclear plants than it needed. Three of them, after an investment of more than $ 4 billion, were scrapped. There were other power problems. The $ 137 million Tellico Dam in eastern <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> was delayed for nearly 10 years by a debate over whether it threatened the existence of a tiny fish called the snail darter. In middle <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> spent $ 80 million on the <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dam </ORGANIZATION>, then halted construction midway through the project, saying it would be too costly to operate. Those were nothing compared to the nuclear woes, however. In 1975, a 12-hour fire knocked out controls used to cool fuel rods in the Unit 2 reactor at <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Browns </ORGANIZATION> Ferry Nuclear Plant near <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>. Until Three Mile Island, it was the nation's worst nuclear accident The low point came in 1985. In March, <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> shut down all three Browns Ferry reactors because they did n't comply with <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>'s tougher safety regulations. In August, both <ORGANIZATION> Sequoyah </ORGANIZATION> reactors were shut down. Initially, <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> thought it was a paperwork problem, simply a matter of checking the plants and providing required _ but missing _ documentation to the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>. But as the checks went on, actual safety defects were uncovered, eventually leading to a major management shakeup and the January 1986 hiring of retired <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> admiral <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> A. White to head the nuclear overhaul. White found an agency marked by low morale, typified by thousands of employee complaints of harassment and intimidation for raising concerns about safety. Most of <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION>'s problems, though, came from not spending enough money to maintain and operate the nuclear plants, <PERSON> White </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Coolidge </PERSON> thought it was a bad idea. So did <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON>, insisting that a government agency competing with private business was `` the negation of the ideals upon which our civilization has been built.'' But for <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Authority </LOCATION> was a chance to show what the government could do to help people help themselves in hard times. <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION>, now a sprawling, controversial agency with an annual budget of more than $ 5 billion, was born in 1933 as part of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Deal </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>'s remedy for the Great Depression. Like other Roosevelt reforms, such as the <ORGANIZATION> Civilian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> was designed to put people back to work while improving their quality of life. The result was a government entity unique in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ an independent agency charged with nurturing an entire region with flood control, navigation and cheap electrical power. <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION>, declared <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>, should be `` clothed with the power of government but possessed of the flexibility and initiative of private enterprise.'' Perhaps in any other period of American history or in any other region except the destitute South of the'30s, <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> would n't have worked. But for people eking out an existence in the cotton fields of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> or the mountains of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, it was a bureaucratic blessing that raised them from darkness into light. In 1933, the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> had a per capita annual income of $ 168, only 45 percent of the national average. About 62 percent of the people _ more than twice the national average _ farmed. Only 28.6 percent _ half the national average _ worked in manufacturing, trades and services. By 1985, the region's per capita income was 77.6 percent of the national average. Just 4.4 percent of the population worked in agriculture, while 74.2 percent were in manufacturing, trades and services. <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> got its start when Sen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Norris </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> began introducing bills in the 1920s to make an idle munitions complex in Muscle Shoals, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, part of a government agency to develop the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> basin. <PERSON> Coolidge </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> vetoed the measures, but <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> endorsed <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> as part of his ambitious recovery program. The fledgling agency was given $ 100 million to start, and promptly found itself in a dogfight with private utilities led by <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Willkie </PERSON>, president of the giant <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` The <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> touches seven states and drains the nation,'' said <PERSON> Willkie </PERSON>. But <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lilienthal </PERSON>, insisting that people wanted public power, set out to create a demand by setting rates at rock-bottom prices and selling electric appliances to <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> customers. In <LOCATION> Tupelo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, the first city to buy <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> power, consumption of electricity went up 83 percent in the first six months. <PERSON> Willkie </PERSON> was unimpressed. `` Every time somebody turns on a light in <LOCATION> Tupelo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, the entire country pays for it,'' he said. The battle ended in 1939 when the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> upheld <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION>'s constitutional right to exist and sell electricity In the meantime, <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> was working to fulfill the grand dreams of <LOCATION> Roosevelt </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Norris </PERSON>, touching virtually every aspect of life in the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. In addition to creating construction jobs, dams like <PERSON> Norris </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Chickamauga </LOCATION> improved navigation and created flood-free sites that lured businesses already attracted by the prospect of cheap power. There are 39 dams in <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION>'s water control system, and the agency estimates they've prevented about $ 2.2 billion in flood damage _ more than five times <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION>'s investment in the system. The once-treacherous <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> is now navigable 650 miles from <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. In 1933, annual barge traffic was 940,223 tons; now it's more than 36 million tons a year. The munitions complex in Muscle Shoals became a leader in developing fertilizer to enrich soil depleted by decades of growing corn, cotton and tobacco. New agricultural methods such as terracing, contour farming, strip cropping and soil surveys were introduced to regenerate the land and increase farm income. Although the region has 40 percent less farmland than in 1933, the per-acre yield has more than doubled. More than 2.1 million acres stripped bare by poor logging practices were reforested. Steps were taken to control local pockets of malaria. Libraries established for <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> construction workers were converted to regional use. At the agency's 30th anniversary celebration in 1963, President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said, `` The work of <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> will never be over.'' `` There will always be new frontiers for it to conquer. For in the minds of men the world over, the initials <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> stand for progress, and the people of this area are not afraid of progress.''

 Compared to the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> genocide that virtually wiped out <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s Jews, a night of window-smashing and arson would seem a pale subject for a documentary. But `` Kristallnacht: The Journey from 1938 to 1988'' spotlights a moment in history when history could have been changed. The world was shocked, but did nothing, and <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s destruction of the Jews went forward. The one-hour film will air over the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> on Nov. 9, the 50th anniversary of `` crystal night,'' when widespread Nazi attacks on synagogues and Jewish businesses and homes littered the streets with shattered glass. `` It was <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s last test to see how the world would react, and the world reacted with silence,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauder </PERSON>, who underwrote the film through his <ORGANIZATION> Ronald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lauder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a philanthropic organization that aims to preserve European Jewish history and culture. <PERSON> Lauder </PERSON>, heir to the <PERSON> Estee </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauder </PERSON> cosmetics fortune, served as ambassador to <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> from 1985-87, and was an outspoken critic of anti-Semitism at a time when Austrians were electing former <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> as their president in spite of his Nazi background. <PERSON> Lauder </PERSON> told a small group that gathered for a preview screening of the documentary that its purpose was `` to teach us a lesson that we have to speak out, speak out whenever there is any type of bigotry government-sponsored, any type of religious persecution.'' The film describes the events through rare pictures, including never-before-seen amateur movies of the burning of a synagogue, and interviews with survivors and witnesses. It later catches up with present-day Austrians and Germans who have varying opinions on their connection to the past. Kristallnacht is well-known in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Lauder </PERSON> said he was chagrined to find out that only about 10 percent of Americans polled by his foundation had ever heard of it. `` It became part of me when I was in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>,'' he said in an interview. `` I began to realize all the different currents, why they were happening. I also saw in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> there were very few synagogues left. One of the major ones ... is today a parking lot. I realized that this was a center of Jewish life, and there's a parking lot. What happened? `` After Nov. 9, 1938, the world was never the same,'' <PERSON> Lauder </PERSON> said. `` There was something different. People could n't put their finger on it, but it was different. It affects your life, it affects my life, it affects all our lives. And that's why I did it. I wanted people to understand it. And no matter how much I explained to people when I travel what happened, I could n't get it across.'' For producer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Frye </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> producer, making <PERSON> Lauder </PERSON>'s film was a difficult project, since little visual material was available. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> did n't want any evidence of the widespread nature of this,'' <PERSON> Frye </PERSON> said. He held little hope for film footage until someone tipped him there was an amateur film sitting in a museum in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` That began a three-four-month process,'' <PERSON> Frye </PERSON> said. `` No one would tell us who owned the film. After leaving <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> on the actual shoot, we drove to <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> and on the way found out ... that the woman who owned the film lived near. So we knocked on the door and completed the deal. It is, as far as I know, the only footage that shows in motion picture terms what happened.'' The film sets the scene through interviews with witnesses who lived in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in 1935 as <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> was rising to power and finding little resistance to his propaganda campaign against Jews. A Polish family forced to leave <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> wrote a plaintive letter to a son in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. To protest the persecution of his family, 17-year-old <PERSON> Herschel </PERSON> <PERSON> Grynzspan </PERSON> walked into the <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> and shot a minor German official, <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> <PERSON> vom </PERSON> <PERSON> Rath </PERSON>. Retribution for <PERSON> vom </PERSON> <PERSON> Rath </PERSON>'s death became an excuse for Kristallnacht. `` This was for good, we knew. The end of our normal life,'' recalls witness <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>. In present-day <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Frye </PERSON>'s cameras follow Israeli professor <PERSON> Meier </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwarz </PERSON> on his quest to find evidence of the Jews who once lived in the <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> of his boyhood. In <LOCATION> Ansbach </LOCATION>, he watches workmen restoring a magnificent synagogue. `` The main thing is to restore what happened here,'' <PERSON> Schwarz </PERSON> says. `` To make a memory for our parents.'' But he acknowledges there is no one to worship in the synagogue. No Jews live in <LOCATION> Ansbach </LOCATION> anymore.

<TEXT>
 A crisis, in medicine, is the crucial point at which it becomes clear whether the patient will live or die. The world's financial system, suffering from a disease called Third World debt, has been in `` crisis'' now for six years, ever since <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in the summer of 1982 stopped paying interest on its debt because of tumbling oil prices. Some, pointing to the improving balance sheets of creditor banks and growing export sales by debtor countries such as <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, say the crisis is over, although the illness remains severe. Others say that _ from the perspective of those countries owing the debt _ the patient has gotten no better and perhaps worse. Those countries have dubbed the 1980s `` the lost decade'' because they have had to sacrifice the living standards of their citizens just to make interest payments. Indeed, just last weekend, seven Latin American leaders, whose countries collectively owe $ 420 billion to banks and international lending organizations, said the crisis is acute enough to threaten the survival of their democracies and has produced `` serious deterioration in the quality of life of the region's peoples.'' Even though there is no agreement that the crisis has ended _ indeed some still fear the patient will not survive _ all sides agree that there is movement toward a new crop of strategies for coping with the $ 1.2 trillion in debt owed by developing countries, which is about $ 400 billion more than when the crisis started. When the crisis first blossomed, a doomsday scenario was in vogue: After another unexpected drop in oil prices or some other financial shock, first one then more big debtors would default, a big <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bank would be pulled down, the panic would spread and additional banks topple, and finally, the world's financial system would collapse. That has n't happened. At the end of 1982, the 17 biggest debtors _ including the five largest, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> _ owed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks $ 91.8 billion, or 130 percent of their capital. In other words, if all 17 countries defaulted simultaneously, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks would have been broke. At the end of June 1988, the debtor countries owed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks nearly as much _ $ 82.2 billion _ but banks had set aside reserves and the debt represented only 64 percent of their capital. The aggregate numbers mask differences among individual banks. Large regional banks have been the most aggressive in reducing their exposure. The nine largest money center banks, however, were still on the hook for more than 100 percent of their capital at the end of 1987. The large banks have set aside reserves of about 30 cents a dollar on the loans and the regional banks have reserved at about 50 percent, but the loans in late October were trading on the international debt market at discounts averaging 60 cents per dollar. `` Developing country debt is clearly a serious problem, but I do n't think one would call it a crisis anymore,'' said <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which insures deposits in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commercial banks. `` Comparing the situation to where we were, the banks have improved their position by a very large margin,'' he said. Banks last year posted their lowest earnings since the Depression, $ 3.7 billion, largely because they added $ 25 billion to Third World debt reserves. But this year, with the reserving behind them, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks in the first six months earned $ 10.5 billion and, having restored <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s loans to paying status after an 18-month interest payment moratorium, are heading toward a record year. `` This reflects obviously the health of the private sector around the world,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, chairmanof <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest banking company `` We are experiencing very much more normal credit circumstances, maybe even an unusually good credit situation, on a global basis.'' <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Butcher </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, one of the biggest lenders to developing nations, argues that debtor countries also are better off. `` <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> will probably have the third largest trade surplus of any country in the world this year. ... <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> -LRB- has -RRB- more than quadrupled its non-oil exports since this crisis set in. ... <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> has literally reduced its debt. ... <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> has made major reductions,'' <PERSON> Butcher </PERSON> said. Since October 1985, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has pursued the `` Baker Plan,'' named after former <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. It called for new loans and stretching out the payments on old loans in exchange for internal economic reforms by debtor countries. But critics such as Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, argue that debtor countries need less, not more debt, if they are to improve their economies and the lives of their people. Even one of the architects of the plan, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, former deputy <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary, acknowledged at a conference in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> a month ago that the strategy failed to bring as much new money to debtors as he and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> had hoped. `` The sad and lamentable fact is there has not been much progress on the Third World debt issue,'' said <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>. `` We have simply postponed the ultimate day of reckoning in the mistaken belief that this type of problem withers away with time.''

 He concedes that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banking system is on less precarious footing, but he argues that if more is not done <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s `` lost decade'' will haunt the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the form of rising political and economic turmoil south of the border Also, developing countries that had once been lucrative markets for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports will no longer be able to buy American goods. `` In <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, half of the population is under the age of 15. If <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> does n't have the money to invest in its economy, they ca n't generate the jobs If they do n't generate the jobs, there's only one place these people are headed and that's north,'' <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said. If the developing countries are to pay less on their debts, someone else must, either the banks or the taxpayers of the creditor nations. Not suprisingly, each wants the others to pay. Bankers look to the taxpayers. Politicians, representing the taxpayers, look to the banks. And the debtors look to both the banks and creditor country governments. But, new alternatives to the <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> plan are beginning to emerge, in part because the banks are financially better able to consider limited debt forgiveness. At the September meetings of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> meetings in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, Japanese Finance Minister <PERSON> Kiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> advanced a plan for debtor countries to buy back their debts at a discount and then issue bonds to their creditors. Repayment of the bonds would be guaranteed through a fund managed by the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION>. President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterand </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> has proposed a similar plan. The strategies have in common that they ask the banks to recognize loss and the taxpayers of the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> member nations to take some risk. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, at least for now, has responded cooly. Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> plan has worked and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` regards with skepticism'' plans that offer `` an illusion of progress.'' That could change, however. `` I think once the election is over there will be a reassessment,'' but not a dramatic shift, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cline </PERSON>, an economist with the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION>, a study group funded by foreign and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foundations. `` My own expectation is we will see a continuation of the basic <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> strategy but it will evolve in the direction of voluntary debt relief,'' he said. `` I would not be suprised to see some form of public guarantee ... that could be set up on a basis on which the public would incur very little risk. `` This has been one of the longer-lasting crises that I can remember, and it will be around a while longer,'' he said. Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in campaign position papers, has backed the <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> plan's call for internal reforms in the economies of debtor nations. He says `` the one realistic approach for helping debtor nations restructure their economies'' would be `` based on the American model of low taxes, deregulation and entrepreneurship.'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, on the other hand, says that he would `` ensure that borrowers and lenders share the burden of debt relief.''

 With the presidential election one week away, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> is unlikely to push interest rates higher, especially because there are signs on the eve of its policy-making session that inflationary pressures are easing. Private economists said Monday they expected interest rates, which have been falling slightly, to stabilize at current levels through the end of the year. But they still were looking for rates to resume an upward climb next year.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Technical factors and thin trading have sparked volatile trading in unleaded gasoline futures, causing a daily price swing of more than 4 cents in the November contract. The November contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline plunged around 4.25 cents a gallon before settling at 50.24 cents a gallon, down 1.52 cents, Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Other energy futures drifted lower Monday. The December contract for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate, the benchmark crude, fell 27 cents a barrel to settle at $ 13.58, after rising 17 cents on Friday. Other contract months also declined. The November contract for wholesale home-heating oil, which rose 0.29 cent a gallon on Friday, settled at 42.62 cents, down 0.71 cent. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Beutel </PERSON>, an energy analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said that in the absence of any market-moving news technical factors dominated trading.

 Interest rates on short-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> securities fell in the government's latest auction, with six-month rates declining to the lowest level in three weeks. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sold $ 7.2 billion in three-month bills at an average discount rate of 7.37 percent on Monday, down from 7.45 percent last week.

<HEAD>VA Lowers Home Loan Interest Rates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, effective today, is lowering its maximum interest rate for federally backed <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> home loan mortgages by one-half percentage point to 10 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> said it was making the change to reflect recent declines in interest rates in financial markets. Fixed-rate mortgages for conventional home loans, those not backed by a government guarantee, dropped to a nationwide average of 10.22 percent last week, according to a survey by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. This rate had been 10.42 percent at the end of September. `` The market conditions permitting the drop reflect a continuing move from the high interest rates of the early 1980s,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Turnage </PERSON>, administrator of veterans affairs. It marked the fourth change in the VA rate this year and the first drop since rates fell by a full percentage point to 9.5 percent on Feb. 1. Rates rose to 10 percent on April 4 and climbed to 10.5 percent on May 23. The <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> said that effective Tuesday a variety of other mortgage rates also will decline by one-half percentage point. Graduated payment mortgages will drop to 10.25 percent, home improvement loans will decline to 11.5 percent, and loans for mobile homes will decline to 12.5 percent. The VA rates apply to new loans, not existing ones. VA mortgages peaked at 17.5 percent in September 1981 before beginning a decline which reached a low for this decade of 8.5 percent in early 1987. For the 12 months ending on Sept. 30, the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> said it guaranteed 232,638 loans totaling $ 17.3 billion. This was down from a record $ 34.8 billion in loans guaranteed in the previous 12 months when big declines in mortgage rates sent a record number of homeowners rushing to refinance at lower rates.

<HEAD>Pension Funds Like KKR, But Are Nervous About Nabisco Bid</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Managers of pension funds, the backbone of <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s leveraged buyout machine, are concerned that the aggressive buyout firm's $ 20.3 billion bid for <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> teeters on hostility. Despite the potential for astronomic financial returns on their investment, several fund managers said Monday they would have to reconsider their commitment to the New York-based firm if <PERSON> Nabisco </PERSON>'s top management ultimately failed to embrace the deal Last week, <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> launched a $ 90-a-share tender offer for Atlanta-based Nabisco that is contingent upon approval by the company's board. <PERSON> Nabisco </PERSON>'s top managers, who put their company in play by announcing they were considering taking the company private for $ 75 a share, or about $ 17 billion, are not expected to be able to match <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON>'s offer, but they still are resisting the <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> bid. Either of those offers would produce the biggest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> takeover ever, and <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> was widely viewed as ready to fight to maintain its position as the premier buyout firm, raising the question of whether it might be willing to make its first hostile takeover bid. Negotiations collapsed last week in an attempt to share the deal between <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Nabisco </PERSON>'s primary financial partner. With a $ 5.6 billion warchest that can be `` leveraged'' tenfold by borrowing, <LOCATION> Kohlberg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kravis </LOCATION> is backed by roughly 70 investors that range from the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> to the endowment funds of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> to the pension funds of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and other states. Among the corporations whose pension funds have pledged some assets are <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION>, which invests state employees' pension money, committed about $ 200 million to <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> on the basis that the firm would participate only in `` friendly'' deals _ those supported by the target's board `` If they change their procedures, we'd have to review'' the state's commitment, said <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bicker </PERSON>, the board's executive director. `` KKR has always said they are going to do friendly deals, and from what we understand, although this has been painted differently in some of the press, this deal still is basically on friendly basis,'' he said. In the brief span of years that <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> has been investing in risky leveraged buyout deals, <PERSON> Bicker </PERSON> said, returns have averaged 30 percent to 40 percent annually, enough to gladden any pension manager. But industry observers note that these buyout funds have been in existence too few years to establish a definitive trend. `` There is n't a long track record _ you ca n't look at 60 years of data'' like you can with the stock market, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Brody </PERSON>, an investment consultant in the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> office of <ORGANIZATION> Hewitt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, a pension consulting firm. In the five years that the leveraged buyout has blossomed, the business environment has been particularly favorable to this type of transaction, <PERSON> Brody </PERSON> said. In a leveraged buyout, roughly 90 percent of an acquisition is paid for with debt, which is then reduced by selling off parts of the company or by dramatic cost-cutting that boosts cash flow. <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> is expected to provide only about $ 2 billion in cash _ most from its leveraged buyout fund _ to finance the <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> deal. Pension fund managers note that investments in buyout funds or in the buyouts themselves are extremely risky. Most pension funds allocate between 5 percent to 10 percent of their total assets to what <PERSON> Brody </PERSON> described as `` riskier and more esoteric forms of investment,'' including real estate, venture capital, oil and gas exploration and leveraged buyouts. A further problem is that there is little liquidity with leveraged buyouts. It is not easy to get money out while the buyout wizards still are trying to sell a company's assets. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON>, controller at <ORGANIZATION> Avon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said his company's pension fund has about $ 10 million invested with <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION>. While the firm's `` historic pattern of returns makes it worth looking at, the volatility is much greater than with general equities,'' he said. `` We would rather they not do hostile deals as a matter of -LRB- our -RRB- corporate conscience, but we do believe <ORGANIZATION> KKR </ORGANIZATION> does not do hostile deals,'' he said. But given that premise, <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> said that any time a money manager such as <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> does `` something out of the ordinary, something that departs from their historic activity, we would review'' the investment. Some corporations that consider themselves potential takeover targets might shy from investing in leveraged buyout funds simply because they would not want to support an industry that one day might threaten them, some experts speculated.

<TEXT>
 Market changes in the wake of a flurry of multibillion-dollar buyout bids have prompted <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to slash the public offering portion of a junk bond issue it will use to finance its acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. In a registration statement with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, Toronto-based <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it would offer $ 750 million of high-risk, high-yield bonds. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> originally had planned to offer $ 1.15 billion in junk bonds, but last week postponed the offering and said it planned to restructure it. The remaining $ 400 million in financing will be obtained through the private placement of notes with institutional investors, <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> said. A source close to the situation said last week the bonds were not put up for sale as planned because of investor uncertainty over junk bonds. Bond traders were concerned about multibillion-dollar buyout bids _ including those for <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Kraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> _ and trading in corporate bonds was at a near standstill last week. Of the bonds provided for in Monday's registration statement, $ 500 million are due in 2000, and $ 250 million are due in 2004. They supersede a planned offering of $ 300 million in notes due in 1994, $ 300 million in notes with extendible due dates, and $ 550 million in debentures due in 2000. Proceeds of the issue are intended to pay off bridge financing supplied by <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Read </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> paid nearly $ 6.71 billion for the Federated shares, but the total cost of the takeover was estimated at $ 8.8 billion Last April, several days after company chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Campeau </PERSON> won his battle with <ORGANIZATION> R.H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>, he told reporters he did not expect to issue junk bonds except for the transaction to create a separate <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary for one <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> division, <ORGANIZATION> Ralphs </ORGANIZATION> Supermarkets However, <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> changed his mind soon after that statement, the source said, `` because the potential of the debt was at the time a very attractive alternative.'' <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> still believed junk bond financing was attractive, the source said last week, but, `` When the market changes, you have to please your investors.'' Some retail industry analysts have said investors are uneasy about <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s financial health. Sales at <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> units have fallen recently, and the two retail divisions reported hefty losses from high interest expenses in <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s most recent quarterly report. Last Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> denied a <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> report saying that <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> and other underwriters had pulled the bond issue back apparently after too many investors had shied away from it.

 <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has become the leader in mergers and acquisitions activity in 1988 with transactions valued at $ 57.05 billion so far, according to <ORGANIZATION> IDD </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. `` This clearly has been <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION>'s year,'' the financial information concern said Monday in its quarterly rankings of the top Wall Street firms doing takeover-related financing and advising. <ORGANIZATION> IDD </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> accounted for 28.7 percent of the total dollar amount of deals in the first nine months of the year.

When the automaker acquired <ORGANIZATION> Hertz </ORGANIZATION>, it had to meet a variety of federal regulations, including those ensuring that the deal would not violate antitrust laws. `` It's a form of vertical integration,'' said Professor <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Salter </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> called the investment a form of vertical integration, a process in which one company takes over another company it normally would supply. `` The question is whether <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s acquisition of Budget is going to give <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> a claim on Budget's car purchases that they would not otherwise have had,'' said economics Professor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Wayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. `` Ford had the account -LRB- with Budget -RRB- anyway ... and nobody got kicked out of Budget,'' he said. `` My instinct that this particular arrangement is not likely to have any anti-competitive effects.'' <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> is not the only automaker with an auto rental investment: <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> acquired a minority interest last month in National Car Rental. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Winters </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> reveal the size of the interest or how much <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> invested.

<HEAD>Melamine Chemicals Tops Forbes List of Best Small Companies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> specialty chemicals company and a syndicator of TV programs head <ORGANIZATION> Forbes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>'s 1988 list of the 200 best small companies in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the magazine said today. Melamine Chemicals, based in <LOCATION> Donaldsonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, took first place as a newcomer to the list, to be published in the magazine's Nov. 14 edition King World Productions, a <LOCATION> Short </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, N.J.-based distributor and syndicator of television programs such as `` Wheel of Fortune,'' is ranked second. The magazine said it evaluated more than 5,000 companies nationwide with sales between $ 1 million and $ 321 million. The 200 that made the list were ranked according to average return on equity, or annual profits as a percent of net worth, over the last five years. <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> said Melamine's five-year average return on equity amounted to 262.7 percent. Its 12-month average was 1,024.2 percent. King World's five-year average return on equity was 62 percent. Quiksilver, a casual sportswear company based in <LOCATION> Anaheim </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, was third on the list with a five-year average return on equity of 61.3 percent. Despite a healthy recovery from last year's stock market crash, the stocks of many high-growth small companies remain well below their highs, <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> said. But some analysts believe the bear market in emerging growth companies stock is about to end. `` The best of the best small companies ... were recently trading at a median 14.2 times earnings,'' the magazine said. The aggregate market value of the 200 best companies was $ 36.7 billion as of Oct. 17. In contrast, the value of the 1987 group was $ 46.4 billion a week before the Oct. 19 market crash and $ 35.5 billion two days after the crash. Aggregate profit of the 200 best small companies exceed $ 2.3 billion, according to the magazine. <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> said only 104 of the 200 companies on last year's list qualified this year. Of the 96 that did not return, 15 were acquired, at least six outgrew the $ 321 million sales limit and the rest could not maintain their growth rates. Value Line, the New York-based financial publishing and investment concern that topped last year's list, dropped to sixth place this year. The largest number of companies _ 15 of the 200 _ were based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> tied for second place, with nine companies.

<HEAD>Newsprint Maker To Delay, Reduce Next Price Hike</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Dollar figures are U.S. unless otherwise noted.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Stubborn newsprint buyers and a lack of support from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers have forced one large Canadian newsprint producer to reduce and delay its next scheduled price increase. Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> has cut its previously announced price increase by a third and says it will wait an extra 30 days before trying to push it through. Instead of raising the price to $ 695 a metric ton on Jan. 1 from $ 650, as initially announced, <ORGANIZATION> CP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> has told its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> customers that it will charge $ 680 starting in February. The decision comes after major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> customers and competitors resisted the efforts by a number of Canadian and one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> newsprint producer _ <ORGANIZATION> Bowater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> _ to raise the price as originally planned Other companies are thinking about similar moves, company officials said. `` We knew it was going to be hard to get,'' said <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Noranda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, one of the companies that announced the original price hike. If too many companies back off on the increase, `` it means we wo n't get it at all,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> CP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> said it had notified its customers of the revised price hike. The company was one of a number that announced in late September that prices for standard newsprint sold in the eastern <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market would rise by about 7 percent on Jan. 1. Canadian companies, which provide about 56 percent of thenewsprintused in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said they needed the increase because the effects of last January's 6.6 percent rise were erased by a decline in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar. They also said their raw material costs had risen. Newspaper executives, in turn, contended that demand for newsprint was down dramatically due largely to a fall in retail advertising and the planned increase therefore was not warranted. They also said a buildup in newsprint inventories would enable them to cut orders for higher-priced paper.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar rose against most European currencies today following reports of continued intervention by the Japanese central bank. Gold prices were lower. Foreign exchange dealers said early European dollar-buying helped boost the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency following dollar purchases by the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> earlier today. The Japanese bank and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> intervened Monday to help increase the currency's value, dealers said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dealers said the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> appeared to be saying it will not let the currency fall below recent levels. European dealers said overall trading was light because of holidays in many <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> countries, including <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost $ 1.7675 to buy one pound, cheaper than $ 1.7678 late Monday. Other mid-morning dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Monday's prices, included: 1.7868 West German marks, up from 1.7810; 1.5042 Swiss francs, up from 1.4995; 6.1010 French francs, up from 6.0800; 2.0158 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0000; 1.2205 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2204. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar rose 0.30 Japanese yen to a closing 125.30 yen today. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it rose slightly to 125.50 yen. Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at bid price of $ 410.80 a troy ounce, lower than its late bid price of $ 411.25 Monday. At mid-morning today, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $ 411.

Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold fell 57 cents to close at a bid $ 413.89. Silver bullion prices fell slightly in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, where the metal was trading at a bid price of $ 6.27 a troy ounce, compared with $ 6.31 late Monday.

<HEAD>Bank Intervention Boosts Dollar, Stocks Inch Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After joint intervention by the central banks of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the dollar today finally rebounded slightly against the Japanese yen. Share prices inched up on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The dollar regained 0.30 yen to close at 125.30 yen. Opening at 125.88 yen, the currency gradually fell while moving in a range of 125.25-125 .88 yen Exchange dealers said intervention by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> to prop up the dollar in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> overnight stimulated dollar-buying in early trading in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> bought dollars Monday, but the market shrugged off the move. So the central bank again purchased the American currency today to keep the dollar from further declining, but again with little effect, said <PERSON> Takamasa </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamasaki </PERSON> with <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Yamasaki </PERSON> estimated the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> bought $ 300 million both days. `` The Bank of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s intervention means it is worried about the dollar's further decline, although it has said that the currency is unlikely to fall further,'' he said. He said nervousness over joint intervention by central banks made it difficult to sell the dollar too fast, but still, the dollar-selling drive was strong among investors. The <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> routinely refuses to comment on its activities. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the 225-issue Nikkei average added 31.13 points, or 0.11 percent, to finish trading at 28,013.67. The Nikkei finished above the 28,000 level for the first time since Aug. 2, when it closed at 28,079.18 points. The index had gained 81.47 points by the end of the morning session, but it gave back some in the afternoon. Stock dealers said traders were taking their profits from six consecutive days of Nikkei gains. But trading was very active, led by institutional investors, they said. Steel issues were among the most active. Volume on the first section of the market was estimated at 1.4 billion shares.

<HEAD>Budget Rent A Car Going Private in Deal Financed by Ford</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Budget Rent A <ORGANIZATION> Car </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is going private with the help of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in a move one analyst says may be matched by other domestic automakers. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> will help finance the $ 333 million deal by purchasing an undisclosed amount of non-voting stock in <ORGANIZATION> Beech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which is acquiring Budget for $ 30 a share, Budget said Monday. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> already owns a majority stake in <ORGANIZATION> Hertz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's No 1 rental car company. Budget is the third-largest car rental agency, behind <ORGANIZATION> Hertz </ORGANIZATION> and second-ranked <ORGANIZATION> Avis </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Finnie </PERSON>, a securities analyst with <PERSON> Alex </PERSON>. Brown & amp; Sons of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s involvement in the deal highlighted the trend toward car company ownership of rental car agencies. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has expressed an interest in owning part of National Car Rental. Rental car companies buy about 10 percent of all the new cars produced, <PERSON> Finnie </PERSON> said, so when car manufacturers own rental car companies, `` you control your supply and you control your customers. I think this is a trend that will continue.'' <PERSON> Finnie </PERSON> said the strong performance of rental car companies _ an offshoot of an increase in air travel _ also has made them attractive takeover targets. Budget is the only publicly owned rental car company in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Neither <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> nor Budget would reveal the amount of money <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> was putting into the deal. However, <PERSON> Budget </PERSON> said it had signed a `` long-term'' supply agreement to continue buying <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> cars, which make up the bulk of Budget's corporately owned fleet. `` Budget now purchases a large number of products from <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and we want to maintain that,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sloan </PERSON>, a spokesman at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters in <LOCATION> Dearborn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>. Budget spokeswoman <PERSON> Jody </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said she had been directed not to comment beyond the text of the company's two-page But she said the Chicago-based company expected to release more information later in the week. Budget is traded on the over-the-counter market and closed Monday at $ 27.25 a share, up $ 9.25. More than half of <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>'s stock is owned by <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, <PERSON> Green </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Amerongen </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Ltd </ORGANIZATION>. The New York-based investment banking firm and <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>'s management purchased the company from <ORGANIZATION> Transamerica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in Sept. 1986 for $ 205 million plus the assumption of some $ 296 million of Budget debt. Budget's management as a group owns about 10 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>'s stock The car agency went public in May 1987 at $ 14 a share. <ORGANIZATION> Beech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION>, the company acquiring Budget, is controlled by an investment group of which <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, Green is the general partner. <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Schipper </PERSON>, a professor of accounting at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>, said Budget's owners appeared to be taking the chunk of the company currently owned by the public and selling it to <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>. `` What you're describing may be some sort of displacement of public with private ownership that carries with it, first of all, deep pockets,'' she said in a telephone interview. `` Ford makes cars, Budget buys cars, so there certainly is some economy of scope to be realized here.'' Although the plan calls for <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> to purchase only non-voting shares of <ORGANIZATION> Beech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION>, `` I imagine there will be some implicit monitoring or input'' by the automaker, Ms. <PERSON> Schipper </PERSON> said. Budget reported its third-quarter earnings rose 57 percent to $ 8.8 million, compared with $ 5.6 million in the third quarter of 1987. Its third-quarter revenue was $ 152.1 million, 32 percent higher than the $ 115.6 million recorded for the same period of 1987.

<HEAD>Index Down 2nd Time in 3 Months</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government said today that its main forecasting gauage of future economic activity edged down 0.1 percent in September, its second decline in the last three months. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Index of Leading Indicators rose 0.5 percent in August and 1.5 percent in June but fell 0.7 percent in July. Economists believe this rollercoaster performance is a signal that the economy, which was expanding at a robust pace in the first six months of 1988, is slowing down. Indeed, overall economic growth as measured by the gross national product dropped to an annual rate of 2.2 percent from July through September and many analysts believe that this modest pace will continue in the current quarter and for most of next year. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said that the leading index was signalling a welcome slowdown, which would give the economy breathing room and lower inflationary pressures built up by heavy demand and tight labor markets. The 0.1 percent decline in the leading index was a bit weaker than expected. Many private forecasters were calling for a 0.2 percent rise. The August index, however, was revised upward to show a 0.5 percent gain instead of the originally reported 0.4 percent increase. The index, by focusing on forward-pointing business statistics, is designed to foretell economic activity six to nine months into the future. Many economists, who had at one time been fearful that the next president would face a recession in his first year in office, have revised that view and now believe the next downturn will not come until 1990. But the leading index is signalling slower growth. For the last 12 months, it has risen just 0.7 percent, compared to an increase of 6.7 percent in the previous 12-month period. For October, the biggest factor holding the index back was a drop in plant and equipment orders, followed by a fall in building permits. Other factors depressing the index were a decline in raw materials prices and slower growth in the money supply. Falling prices are viewed negatively as a sign of lower demand. In all, five of the available nine indicators made positive contributions. The biggest positive force came from an increase in the average workweek. Other positive factors were a fall in initial unemployment claims, a rise in stock prices, a slowdown in filling orders and a rise in orders for consumer goods. The various changes left the index at 193.3 percent of its 1967 base of 100. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, head of a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> forecasting firm, said he is predicting GNP growth of just 2 percent next year, reflecting a slowdown of the export boom which accounted for half of this year's growth `` The export boom is clearly gone, capital spending has tailed off and consumers have n't been too eager to spend either,'' said <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>. `` That is basically the whole economy.'' But <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON>, the president's chief economic adviser, said in a speech last week that there was no reason for a recession to occur anytime soon. `` Recessions do n't just happen. They are caused by policy mistakes,'' he said. If a recession does occur next year, many analysts are fearful that it will be triggered by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> pushing interest rates too high in an effort to dampen inflationary pressures. Fed policymakers were meeting behind closed doors today, but analysts did not expect the session to result in any dramatic changes. However, they said the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is likely to begin pushing rates higher early next year as signs of inflation re-emerge.

 <ORGANIZATION> Charles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schwab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest discount securities broker, acknowledged that an internal investigation found it made as much as $ 2 million from unauthorized customer trades. The company said the improper trading has ceased and that it has informed the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> of the situation. The Schwab trades came to light in the current issue of Business Week magazine, in which an unidentified employee said the company profited by trading in securities, warrants and rights owned by customers without their permission. The employee claimed the practice was sanctioned by the company from 1985 until last month. <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Quackenbush </PERSON>, a Schwab senior vice president, said his firm began its internal investigation into the trades Oct. 6, before the magazine story surfaced. <PERSON> Quackenbush </PERSON> said the amounts involved were very small except in a couple of cases. However, he said over the last four years the firm may have generated between $ 1 million to $ 2 million in additional income from these activities, and that should be returned to the customer. `` It's a murky area. It's a complex issue how to deal with this. If a guy gets 2 cents on one of these trades, should we spend 39 cents on the postage to let him know?'' <PERSON> Quackenbush </PERSON> said. Often these deals were not viable for individual shareholders, but wre profitable for the brokerage. For example, <PERSON> Quackenbush </PERSON> said, a broker might have sold 10,000 or more expiring rights to purchase stock and have earned a commission of 2 cents on each right.

 The government said today that its main forecasting gauge of future economic activity edged down 0.1 percent in September, its second decline in the last three months. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Index of Leading Indicators rose 0.5 percent in August and 1.5 percent in June but fell 0.7 percent in July. Economists believe this rollercoaster performance is a signal that the economy, which was expanding at a robust pace in the first six months of 1988, is slowing down. Indeed, overall economic growth as measured by the gross national product dropped to an annual rate of 2.2 percent from July through September and many analysts believe that this modest pace will continue in the current quarter and for most of next year. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the leading index was signaling a welcome slowdown, which would give the economy breathing room and lower inflationary pressures built up by heavy demand and tight labor markets. `` We are seeing a pretty sluggish leading indicator and that is consistent with where the economy is going,'' he said. `` We are looking for an economy that is slowing but not stopping.'' He predicted the GNP would grow 2.3 percent for 1989, down from an expected 3.8 percent GNP growth rate for all of 1987. In a second report today, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said that construction spending rose 0.6 percent in September to an annual rate of $ 403.4 billion as strength in housing and government construction offset a decline in office building. The 0.1 percent decline in the leading index was a bit weaker than expected. Many private forecasters were calling for a 0.2 percent rise. The August index, however, was revised upward to show a 0.5 percent gain instead of the originally reported 0.4 percent increase. The index, by focusing on forward-pointing business statistics, is designed to foretell economic activity six to nine months into the future. Many economists, who had at one time been fearful that the next president would face a recession in his first year in office, have revised that view and now believe the next downturn will not come until 1990. But the leading index is signalling slower growth. For the last 12 months, it has risen just 0.7 percent, compared to an increase of 6.7 percent in the previous 1-month period. For September, the biggest factor holding the index back was a drop in plant and equipment orders, followed by a fall in building permits. Other factors depressing the index were a decline in raw materials prices and slower growth in the money supply. Falling prices are viewed negatively as a sign of lower demand. In all, five of the available nine indicators made positive contributions. The biggest positive force came from an increase in the average workweek. Other positive factors were a fall in initial unemployment claims, a rise in stock prices, a slowdown in filling orders and a rise in orders for consumer goods. The various changes left the index at 193.3 percent of its 1967 base of 100. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, head of a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> forecasting firm, said he is predicting GNP growth of just 2 percent next year, reflecting a slowdown of the export boom which accounted for half of this year's growth `` The export boom is clearly gone, capital spending has tailed off and consumers have n't been too eager to spend either,'' said <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>. `` That is basically the whole economy.'' But <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON>, the president's chief economic adviser, said in a speech last week that there was no reason for a recession to occur anytime soon. `` Recessions do n't just happen. They are caused by policy mistakes,'' he said. If a recession does occur next year, many analysts are fearful that it will be triggered by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> pushing interest rates too high in an effort to dampen inflationary pressures. Fed policymakers were meeting behind closed doors today, but analysts did not expect the session to result in any dramatic changes. However, they said the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is likely to begin pushing rates higher early next year as signs of inflation re-emerge.

<HEAD>State: Deceptive Practices Used in Drought Insurance Sale</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A subsidiary of the <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> could be forced to pay more than $ 16 million in claims to <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> farmers if the state can prove the company used deceptive and unfair practices in selling what farmers thought was drought insurance. The state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> on Monday cited nine alleged violations of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> law in administrative charges filed after a four-month investigation of <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary. <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> officials had not seen the charges and could not comment on them, said <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Devlin </PERSON>, a senior vice president of the company, in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The department said Federal sold insurance against inadequate rain _ a type of policy not authorized by state law _ to farmers who thought they were buying coverage for extensive drought-related crop losses. `` Even if they had issued policies to every farmer who applied for and paid premium for this coverage, it could have meant a windfall for some farmers and provided no protection at all for others even if their comparative crop losses were identical,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Enoex </PERSON>, chief attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. State Insurance Director <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Washburn </PERSON> scheduled a hearing on the charges Dec. 1 in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>. If the charges are proved, <PERSON> Washburn </PERSON> said, Federal could be required to pay $ 16.8 million in claims to 702 farmers, and might also face suspension or revocation of its insurance license. Insurance agents in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> advertised the insurance and accepted premiums in late spring, when many farmers already suspected that a dry growing season was in store. The state charged that Federal allowed farmers to assume they had received coverage after filing an application and paying a premium, but then began rejecting the applications nearly halfway through the three-month term of the policies. Federal also arbitrarily changed the amount of insurance it planned to make available in each of several different <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> regions `` whenever it seemed to fit their needs,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, assistant director of the <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Federal has paid nearly $ 6 million in claims to 246 <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> farmers, and has made an additional $ 1.4 million in `` goodwill payments'' to 720 farmers who applied for but did n't receive coverage, the <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. Farmers from all over the country who paid premiums are party to a class-action lawsuit in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> that seeks to force <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> to extend coverage to anyone who paid a premium and still wants the insurance.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automakers built 6.4 percent fewer cars in the 1988 model year than in the previous year, and assembled the lowest number of cars since 1983, an industry trade journal says. In Monday's edition, <ORGANIZATION> Automotive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said manufacturers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> made 6,903,518 cars, down from 7,375,359 in the model 1987 year. In 1983, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automakers assembled 5,768,893 cars. Only <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and American <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> showed gains in production during the 1988 model year over the 1987 model year. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> increased its output by 19.34 percent, and <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> went up by 15.75 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> benefited from strong demand for <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> <PERSON> Continentals </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Escorts </ORGANIZATION> during the 1988 model year. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> production fell 14.26 percent between 1987 and 1988, partly because of the six-month closing of its <LOCATION> Framingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, plant. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> production dropped 17.78 percent, with the largest percentage production drop coming in its <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> cars at 24.28 percent. Production at <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION> fell 33.58 percent, in part because its plant in <LOCATION> Smyrna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, was producing trucks during parts of the year <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the joint venture between <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, produced 43.24 percent fewer cars in the 1988 model year compared with 1987, partly because of slow sales of the Chevrolet Nova.

 The stock market was mixed in early trading today. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 4.98 points at 2,153.63 at 11 a.m. EST. The broader market was lower, however. Declining issues edged out advancing ones by around 6 to 5 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 610 issues down, 545 up and 551 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> totaled 52.96 million shares. Some analysts said they expected a dull session today and an uneventful market for the rest of the week, as activity stalls before the presidential election next Tuesday. Market participants also are awaiting Friday's release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unemployment data for October. `` You know what it is to watch paint dry on a wall?'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Raftery </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Wall Street shrugged off the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s report today that the index of leading indicators, the main forecasting gauge of future economic activity, edged down 0.1 percent in September It was the second such decline in the last three months. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks had edged up 0.17 to 157.11. At the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the market value index was down 0.69 at 300.26.

Democratic candidate <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was focusing on his home state of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. Former Democratic contender <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> joined <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> Monday night at a rally in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where the preacher-turned-politician responded to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s `` read my lips'' refrain. `` You watch our hips as we march,'' to the voting booth, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told the crowd at the <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Olive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator urged those in the audience to get out and vote. `` Do n't tell me your vote does n't count _ it does,'' he said. While <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> focused on <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and its third-largest electoral prize of 29 votes, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> sought support in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and its biggest electoral bounty of 47 votes. ABC News polls taken over the weekend gave <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the lead in both states, in surveys of about 500 likely voters in each state. In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, it was 52 percent for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to 45 percent for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, and in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> it was 51-44, with polling margins of error of plus or minus five percentage points. In his major appeal to women voters, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said the Republican ticket wanted to outlaw abortions. `` I believe a choice that personal must be made by the woman in the exercise of her beliefs,'' the Democratic nominee told an audience in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> cited <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s response to an 11-year-old girl's question last week about what she should do if she was raped by her father and became pregnant. The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidate said that he favored childbirth over abortion even under those circumstances. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also challenged <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to an hour-long debate the night before the election, but the Republican nominee scoffed at his rival's idea and suggested that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> debate himself. The topic of ads arose in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s interview with NBC News anchorman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON>, who questioned the vice president about whether his commercial saying ` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> led the way' on the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was an exaggeration. `` Well, I hope it did n't indicate that I was out in front of the president,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>MCorp Files Suit Against Rederal Reserve Board</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> has filed a lawsuit against the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, challenging a regulatory order that prohibits it from paying dividends on its preferred stock. The suit is the latest clash between <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> and federal regulators over the shape of the recapitalization of the troubled bank holding company. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> issued its order to stop payment on preferred stock dividends on Oct. 19. Two days later, <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> said it would suspend such payments but also announced it would put a moratorium on payments of about $ 470 million in debt. <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION>, which recently sought a federally assisted bailout, said the order came after it notified regulators of its intention to take the two actions. According to the suit, which was filed Friday, <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> told regulators sometime after Oct. 7 that the two actions would be considered at a board meeting on Oct. 21. Since <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> already had come up with a plan to stop the dividends and debt payments, the order from the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> was unfounded, the suit said. `` MCorp never had and does not have any intention to dissipate its assets,'' the suit said. `` Moreover, the orders are unreasonable, oppressive and render impractical the conduct of the normal business operations of <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> officials declined comment on the suit. The suit comes three weeks after <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' second-largest banking company, asked for federal help in a management-led reorganization that would include $ 400 million from the holding company, $ 400 million raised from private investors and shareholders and an undetermined amount from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>.

 Grain and soybean futures opened mostly lower today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> as the technically inspired buying of the previous two sessions evaporated in light of a new crop of bearish factors. Among the negatives were the continued slow pace of export sales, the greatly improved growing conditions for corn and soybeans in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the rapid harvest of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn and soybeans, analysts said. `` I think the market's going down today _ there's just no support,'' said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Taiwan's Rags-To-Riches Billionaire Shuns Publicity</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANNIE HUANG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Billionaire </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsai </PERSON> <PERSON> Wan-lin </PERSON>, the richest man in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and one of the wealthiest in the world, is a rags-to-riches Midas who shuns publicity, loves solitude and finds comfort in quiet evenings at home. The younger of two sons of a poor rice farmer near <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tsai </PERSON> and his brother ran a fruit and vegetable stand as teen-agers. Later they purchased a soy sauce factory and branched out into real estate. Today, the 64-year-old <PERSON> Tsai </PERSON> owns <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s largest insurance company and a major real estate and construction conglomerate. Together their total assets of 132 billion <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> dollars _ about $ 4.5 billion _ is equivalent to roughly one-fourth of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s annual national budget In July, <ORGANIZATION> Forbes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION> ranked <PERSON> Tsai </PERSON> as the world's eighth richest man with a personal fortune estimated at $ 5.6 billion. But Wealth, a respected <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> business magazine, says <PERSON> Tsai </PERSON> is even richer, the result of a profitable killing on the volatile <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> stock market this year when share prices of his <ORGANIZATION> Cathay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> tripled. <PERSON> Tsai </PERSON> and his family own roughly 90 percent of the company's stock. <PERSON> Tsai </PERSON> has seldom discussed his wealth publicly and he has never been interviewed. His associates say the reclusive executive does n't like to talk about his business practices and draw attention to his fortune But Cathay's Managing Director <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> <PERSON> Chia-lin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Tsai </PERSON> told his executives once that, `` being a billionaire does not mean very much to me and I would be pleased if I could make those who work for me millionaires.'' A short, energetic and solidly-built man, <PERSON> Tsai </PERSON> still spends eight hours daily at his office, and maintains a lifestyle that is conservative when compared to those of other local tycoons. For instance, he has rejected suggestions he trade in his 1987 <ORGANIZATION> Mercedez </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benz </ORGANIZATION> 560 SEL for a Rolls <PERSON> Royce </PERSON> because he `` does n't want to show off,'' said <PERSON> Liu </PERSON>. Also, <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Tsai </PERSON> prefers to spend quiet evenings at home with his family rather than wine and dine fellow businessmen and government officials in the common practice here. <PERSON> Tsai </PERSON> and his family live in an unpretentious apartment building a block from his insurance company's new 28-story headquarters in <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION>'s business district. Each of his three sons, who work at Cathay or its affiliate companies, have separate apartments in the building. On weekends, <PERSON> Tsai </PERSON> and his wife of 40 years usually relax at their two-story villa in the exclusive Yangmingshan suburb of <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION>. He has no hobbies but occasionally plays golf alone because he enjoys solitude, associates say. Cathay's <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> says there is another reason why <PERSON> Tsai </PERSON> plays alone: `` He walks too fast on the golf course and others have a hard time catching up.'' <PERSON> Tsai </PERSON> and his brother <PERSON> Wan-chun </PERSON>, who died last year, established <ORGANIZATION> Cathay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in 1962 when the government approved licenses for <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s first eight private insurance companies. For the next few years, <PERSON> Tsai </PERSON> traveled extensively throughout <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, visiting branch offices and assembling an aggressive sales staff. Today, <PERSON> Cathay </PERSON> controls almost 60 percent of the insurance market. As Cathay profited, it became the cornerstone of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s second largest conglomerate that included extensive interests in financial institutions, restaurants, shipping, construction, real estate and advertising companies. <PERSON> Tsai </PERSON> acquired sole ownership of <ORGANIZATION> Cathay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> in 1979 when he and his brother agreed to divide their fortunes. The younger <PERSON> Tsai </PERSON> received the flagship insurance company and several affiliates. Cathay now owns 120 office buildings, mostly in lucrative downtown <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION>, and a dozen more are under construction. The company has a policy of renting, rather than selling, office space. In the past year, <ORGANIZATION> Cathay </ORGANIZATION>'s purchase of vast tracts of land has been blamed for soaring real estate prices that have doubled. Last year when the government liberalized its monetary policies, <PERSON> Cathay </PERSON> began searching for overseas investments. Earlier this year, it invested $ 90 million in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and Japanese stock and bond markets. <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> says <PERSON> Tsai </PERSON> remains a cautious businessman and keeps a firm grip on each of Cathay's affiliates. He diversifies into allied businesses only when he is confident his affiliates are solidly profitable. To boost employee morale, <PERSON> Tsai </PERSON>'s conglomerate has a profit-sharing plan and workers receive generous bonuses. Last year, each of the conglomerate's 22,000 employees received a traditional year-end bonus equivalent to six months salary. In 1985, <PERSON> Tsai </PERSON> had to battle to prevent damage to his empire in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s worst financial scandal blamed on elder brother <PERSON> Wan-chun </PERSON>'s second son, Chen-chou, 39, a free-spending member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> Chen-chou was accused of issuing bad checks and diverting $ 200 million in loans from a major savings and loans cooperative where he was chairman to his other financially troubled companies. Although <PERSON> Tsai </PERSON> was not directly involved in the scandal, his insurance company was threatened because of his family ties. <PERSON> Tsai </PERSON> dispatched 10,000 salesmen to placate his clients and made a personal loan of $ 7.5 million to his nephew's savings and loan cooperative but refused further assistance. The government eventually intervened and suspended the operations of Chen-chou's cooperative. Chen-chou was convicted of various charges and sentenced to jail where he died last year from a liver ailment.

<HEAD>Nation's Hospitals Hope Philanthropists Will Ease Financial Pains</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 As hospitals nationwide feel a financial pinch and some face the possibility of closing, industry officials are turning to a traditional source of money they've seldom tapped _ philanthropists. Despite dire predictions about the effects of new tax laws on private contributions, industry surveys show that hospitals throughout the country are depending more and more on the cash gifts of individual donors. In an attempt to attract those private dollars, members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> recently met in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> to unveil a $ 2 million national campaign seeking private hospital contributions. Its goal is to double philanthropic donations to hospitals in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> by 1992, said association spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Childress </PERSON>. According to an <ORGANIZATION> NAHD </ORGANIZATION> survey, $ 3 billion was given to hospitals in the two countries last year. `` Hospitals do need to look at alternative sources of funding,'' <PERSON> Childress </PERSON> said. `` Philanthropy just seems to be an untapped resource ... It's something that hospital CEOs and administrators are becoming aware of.'' Economic pressures are so severe for some institutions, they've turned to philanthropic contributions to meet operating expenses, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Anstendig </PERSON>, public relations representative for the national association `` There are a lot of hospitals teetering on the edge of financial foreclosure,'' he said. Others are investing contributions in new plant and equipment. For instance, at <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, $ 125,000 in contributions from 50 area corporations is helping to fund an Express Care Center for the hospital's emergency department. At <ORGANIZATION> Cooper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital-University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, a $ 380,000 donation is going toward re-equipping the hospital's cardiac catheterization laboratory While colleges and other institutions have long cultivated their fund-raising efforts, hospitals are just starting to get more professional in their approach, he said. <ORGANIZATION> NAHD </ORGANIZATION>, an organization of 2,300 industry officials representing 1,450 non-profit hospitals, has produced public service announcements narrated by <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> for the organization's new campaign. <PERSON> Childress </PERSON> said the campaign concentrates on individuals rather than corporations. Although corporate donations to hospitals have not increased significantly in recent years _ and in some years have declined _ <ORGANIZATION> NAHD </ORGANIZATION>'s annual surveys show that individual donations have gone up. In 1987, individuals accounted for more than $ 1 billion in cash contributions to hospitals that responded to an association survey. Corporations accounted for $ 199 million in cash contributions. Those figures compare with a similar survey in 1984 that revealed individuals gave $ 475 million and corporations gave $ 180 million to the hospitals responding. The number of people donating to hospitals has increased as well, shooting from 1.4 million in 1984 to 3.4 million in 1987. <ORGANIZATION> NAHD </ORGANIZATION> President and Chief Executive Officer <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> McGinly </PERSON> acknowledges that philanthropy alone will not cure the increasingly troubled hospital industry. But he said hospitals are starting to recognize its importance. `` I know we've seen a tremendous attention to it _ particularly in the last two years,'' <PERSON> McGinly </PERSON> said. That's the case for the nation at large. But in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, which leads the nation in hospital closings, officials have found the economic slowdown is discouraging philanthropic gifts. `` I do not see a trend toward private contributions,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> DaSilva </PERSON>, senior vice president for public affairs for the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> DaSilva </PERSON> said the problem is the slow <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> economy: `` It's a hurdle that the hospitals just ca n't clear.'' So far this year, 16 <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> hospitals have closed, and at least 20 are expected to have shut down by the end of the year. Like other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hospitals, the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> institutions are facing financial crises because of a change in Medicare reimbursements. Instead of repaying hospitals for a patient's actual medical expenses, the government pays a set rate for a particular diagnosis, often leaving hospitals without full reimbursement. Other factors include the general trend away from in-patient hospital stays and moves by private corporations to cut back on medical expenses. <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beard </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Hendrick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Abilene </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NAHD </ORGANIZATION> conference committee chairman, said tax reform laws that went into effect in 1987 apparently have not affected charitable donations. After 1986, people who do not itemize their tax returns were unable to deduct charitable contributions, and that raised concern that donations to hospitals and other non-profit organizations might drop. `` I was amazed at how many billions of dollars they were talking about there,'' <PERSON> Beard </PERSON> said. However, he said, according to the 1988 edition of the publication Giving <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>, $ 93.7 billion was donated to charities throughout the country in 1987. That was up from $ 88 billion in 1986. <PERSON> Beard </PERSON> said that shows tax deduction apparently is not the primary reason people give to charities.

<TEXT>
 In a state where bank holding companies are battling to stay afloat by reverting to non-Texan control, fourth-generation banker <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frost </PERSON> is confident his <ORGANIZATION> Cullen-Frost </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> will survive the tough times, much as it did during the Depression. The 120-year-old company, founded by a former <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ranger </ORGANIZATION> and Confederate officer, is the last holdout in an industry pounded by dropping petroleum and real estate prices. Other <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> banks have been forced to seek buyers or merge with out-of-state groups to keep running. Cullen-Frost, with 13 banks in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>, has more than $ 3 billion in assets. It was the only <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> bank holding company with assets of more than $ 1.5 billion to make a profit last year. Frost, the fourth generation chief executive officer, as a youth witnessed the bank survive the Depression and later sat through board meetings with his relatives. He says he is n't surprised his holding company has so far weathered the bailout storm. `` We were n't so brilliant,'' the 60-year-old <PERSON> Frost </PERSON> says of the banks' survival. `` We used a cultural, long-standing way of doing business and that served us well.'' `` I will criticize myself for being less innovative. I was taught that we made our progress through long-term relationships and not through individual transactions and that is kind of the key in the real estate business,'' he said. Cullen-Frost, with its conservative money-lending attitude, has withstood an economic crisis that in the last two years has gobbled up <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancshares </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancshares </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> BancTexas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancorporation </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancshares </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancshares </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, and most recently MCorp. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Carden </PERSON>, a former banker and now a bank consultant in <LOCATION> Waco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, says many banks were living high on the hog in the late 1970s and early 1980s and failed to see the trouble ahead. `` It was just a classic example of a case of a state that shot itself in the foot,'' <PERSON> Carden </PERSON> said. `` Next year is going to be another tough year. You do n't recover from 10 years of bad lending in one or two years.'' He says <PERSON> Cullen-Frost </PERSON>'s conservative attitude helped it, as well as <PERSON> Frost </PERSON>'s dedication. `` I always had the feeling that Cullen-Frost was a ... pretty well run company,'' <PERSON> Carden </PERSON> said. `` Their lead bank in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> has always been a well-run bank and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Frost </PERSON> is kind of a legend in the business. He has surrounded himself with a lot of good people.'' Col. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Frost </PERSON>, who led a <ORGANIZATION> Confederate </ORGANIZATION> company during the Civil War, founded a mercantile trade business that later became <ORGANIZATION> Frost </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in 1868. The colonel's son, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, guided the bank during a money panic in 1907 and several years later helped incorporate the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION>. Another of the colonel's sons, J.H. <PERSON> Frost </PERSON>, guided the bank through the Depression, surviving a huge depositors' run. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frost </PERSON> eventually turned the operation over to <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Frost </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, his nephew and the father of the current bank leader, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Frost </PERSON> IV. In 1977, <ORGANIZATION> Frost </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> merged with <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Cullen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, founded by the descendants of <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cullen </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> businessman and philanthropist. In 1982, the <PERSON> Kempner </PERSON> family of <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> merged their <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankshares </ORGANIZATION> into Cullen-Frost. In the past three years, the plunging petroleum industry and the reeling real estate market began to take a toll on numerous banks around the state, and <PERSON> Cullen-Frost </PERSON>'s were no exception. The company had to write off $ 53 million in bad energy loans during 1983 and 1984. It could have turned to the real estate industry to recoup them, but did n't, partly because of the generations-old philosophy of doing business with long-term customers. The tradition proved to be a wise course for Cullen-Frost. `` I remember my uncle specifically telling me, ` <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>, remember we lend to people who happen to be in the cattle business, who then obviously have cattle to offer as collateral,'' he said. `` We make the assessment beginning with taking care of the customer and trying to build a relationship and do n't just leap to the fact that anybody who walks in with a head of cattle is honest and we will lend x-amount of dollars to.''' Cullen-Frost was able to make profits by selling its credit card business for $ 5.7 million in 1986. Last year it sold its high-rise <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> headquarters, which will generate a $ 17 million profit over 13 years. <PERSON> Frost </PERSON>, who had wanted to become a petroleum engineer some 40 years ago, now is glad he chose the family business. He predicts more rocky times ahead, but is confident his banks will survive because it has more equity than non-performing assets. `` The real estate market has not come out of it in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` There are still problems developing in the banking industry and for us too, but we look upon ours as manageable and that we can handle with our own resources.''

 A group led by <ORGANIZATION> Odyssey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it has agreed to acquire the Georgia-based <ORGANIZATION> Forstmann </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest manufacturer of woolen and woolen-blend fabrics, in a deal valued at about $ 186 million. Odyssey, an aggressive Wall Street investment partnership, and its partners will pay $ 11.75 for each of <ORGANIZATION> Forstmann </ORGANIZATION>'s 5.5 million outstanding shares and assume about $ 120 million of debt. Under terms of the agreement, a tender offer is to begin promptly. In active trading on the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Forstmann </PERSON> shares had jumped $ 1.25 a share to $ 11.12 -LCB- at midday.

He will become chief executive officer of the company. `` It's not a hostile deal.

<HEAD>A Market of Rabbits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Even before the latest hot-stock mania, the one based on rumors about which company is likely to be raided next, the stock markets had become rabbit warrens. There are many animals on Wall Street, but the most familiar of them are bulls, who are aggressively optimistic beasts, and bears, who are generally more dour and often less active. And there are rabbits. Rabbits run here and there, nibbling all the time rather than settling down for a good dinner. They taste the grass, then the clover and lettuce and turnip greens. They seldom stay long in a spot. Something always looks better. They are speculators, and measurements of their activities show how active they've become. Between 1940 and 1975, investors on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> held their stocks an average of five years. Now, the average is 17 months. Rabbits generally are institutions rather than individuals, and again the statistics demonstrate this finding. Individuals own 60 percent of all common stocks, but they account for less than 20 percent of <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> volume. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Perritt </PERSON>, editor of the Chicago-based newsletter `` Investment Horizons'' and a former college professor of mathematics, offers this startling observation: `` If institutional investors traded with the same frequency as individual investors, daily volume would shrink by 64 percent, the share turnover rate would drop to approximately 26 percent and the average holding period would be lengthened from 16.5 months to nearly four years.'' <PERSON> Perritt </PERSON>, whose curiosity and skill draw him into areas unfamiliar to other market analysts, loaded his computer recently with data on the trading behavior of equity mutual funds over the past four years. `` Here's what I found,'' he said. `` Over the period 1984-1987, the annual portfolio turnover rate for equity funds averaged 75 percent. That is, the typical equity fund held on to its stock purchases an average of 16 months. `` Furthermore, portfolio turnover has been on the rise. The turnover rate averaged 69 percent in 1984, about 73 percent in 1985, 77 percent in 1986 and a whopping 80 percent last year.'' <PERSON> Perritt </PERSON> found that nine of the 288 equity funds surveyed had portfolio turnover rates in excess of 300 percent last year. That is, they turned their portfolio over at least three times in 12 months, causing him to observe: `` ... if your stock broker maintained this turnover rate in a discretionary account, he could be successfully sued by a customer for churning the account.'' After viewing such figures, there remains no mystery about why the stock market is so volatile and sometimes erratic. It has become a market of in-out trading, of speculation. It has become a gathering of rabbits. Portfolio insurance, program trading and various computer-operated buy and sell programs are at the root of the ballooning trading volume. It becomes a contagious thing. Those ordinarily inclined to hold stocks for the long term, for example, are drawn into the speculative game simply to survive. And that leads to another irony: Numerous surveys down through the years have shown that more stable, long-term investing patterns provide small investors with either better or at least equally good results. Moreover, long-term traders do n't pay the big commissions or fees that are paid by speculators. They sleep better too. And so long as they do n't sell they also get a tax deferment; they pay no capital gains taxes until they sell. If all this frightens you, <PERSON> Perritt </PERSON> offers a possible alternative. `` Head for the small-firm segment of the stock market,'' he says. Turnover is much less there, and many of the smaller companies have better growth rates too. In addition, some of these smaller companies are undervalued. Why? Because, says <PERSON> Perritt </PERSON>, they are too small to attract the big institutional portfolio managers, the rabbits who churn the bigger markets.

 For people who hate typing on keyboards, <ORGANIZATION> Wang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday announced a way to communicate with a personal computer by writing on a tablet or talking to the machine. The basic Freestyle system for hand-writing commands costs $ 1,995 and works with any <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> AT-compatible personal computer. The device that allows people to put voice `` notes'' into the computer costs an extra $ 1,495. The system is expected to appeal to senior executives who have money to spend and never learned to type. The writing device is a stylus that works the same as a `` mouse'' pointing device but is easier to use, <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> said. `` Writing with a mouse is like writing with a potato,'' <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, who headed the design effort, told the <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>. The voice system would allow someone to make a verbal comment on a memo, attach it to the memo and send the package to someone else on a network. The announcement of Freestyle was scheduled for Wednesday but was moved up after a computer trade publication leaked it. The system will be available in January.

<HEAD>Chancellor Predicts Slower Economic Growth, Unveils Spending Plans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>, under increasing pressure over <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s surging inflation rate, trade deficit and interest rates, on Tuesday predicted what economists call a `` soft landing'' for the British economy next year. Economic growth was expected to slow to 3 percent in 1989 following a faster-than-expected expansion of 4.5 percent this year, <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> said in his annual autumn statement in Parliament. `` Growth next year is forecast to return at a sustainable level,'' <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> said, `` while inflation will resume its downward path.'' Under the British budgetary process, the chancellor outlines the government's public spending plans in the autumn statement and its revenue raising plans in the March budget. He uses both occasions to make economic forecasts. The annual inflation rate would rise to more than 6 percent in the fourth quarter, peak at an unspecified level in the middle of 1989 and then fall back to 5 percent by the end of next year, <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> predicted. The country's current account deficit, which includes invisible trade such as overseas investment earnings, would balloon to a larger-than-expected 13 billion pounds -LRB- $ 23 billion -RRB- this year and then shrink somewhat, to 11 billion pounds -LRB- $ 19.5 billion -RRB- next year, <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> said. Unemployment, which has fallen sharply and stands at 8 percent, was expected to fall further, <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> said. The new forecasts showed that <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>'s March predictions of 3 percent economic growth, 4 percent inflation and a current account deficit of 4 billion pounds -LRB- $ 7.1 billion -RRB- this year were way off the mark. There have been increasing concerns that the economy, currently growing at an annual rate of 4 percent, is overheating, as the inflation rate has risen to 5.7 percent from 3.3 percent in January. This has prompted Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s Conservative government to push up <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s benchmark interest rate, the commercial banks' base lending rate, to its current 12 percent level from 7.5 percent in June. <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> attributed the expected fourth-quarter increase in inflation to higher mortgage rates following the government's move to push up interest rates. The chancellor reiterated his commitment to raising British interest rates to curb resurgent inflation, which is Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s No 1 economic priority. Without specifying, <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> said interest rates would be kept `` at whatever level is necessary'' to curb inflation. The financial markets had little reaction to <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>'s speech, which dealers said contained no major surprises. The pound was little changed at $ 1.7620 afterward, and the <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> 100-share index finished the day 5.4 points, or 0.3 percent higher, at 1,857.8. `` He did predict a soft landing for the economy,'' as had been expected, said <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Harwood </PERSON>, an economist at the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> investment firm, <ORGANIZATION> Warburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. But to cheers from the opposition benches, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> attacked the speech, saying, `` This is an autumn statement that compounds rather than corrects the errors of the budget.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> agreed to the spending plans for the year starting April 1, at a Tuesday morning meeting. <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> would enjoy a bigger-than-expected fiscal budget surplus of 10 billion pounds -LRB- $ 17.7 billion -RRB- in the current year, compared with a previously forecast surplus of 3 billion pounds -LRB- $ 5.3 billion -RRB-. <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> announced in March that there would be a surplus, the first in nearly 20 years. At that time, he slashed the top income tax rate from 60 percent to 40 percent and the basic rate from 27 percent to 25 percent. Many government critics blame those cuts for the current consumer spending boom in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. On Tuesday, the chancellor said public spending for 1988-1989 was expected to amount to 153.5 billion pounds -LRB- $ 272 billion -RRB-, less than the 156.75 billion pounds -LRB- $ 277 billion -RRB- previously planned, partly thanks to a drop in social security spending because of lower unemployment. That meant total public spending, which Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> has aimed to curtail, would represent less than 40 percent of national income this year, the lowest level in 20 years, <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Sister-State Agreement Between Alaska and Soviet Territory Inked</HEAD>

 <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> signed the first sister-state agreement with a Soviet territory when a trade delegation recently visited the Soviet city of <LOCATION> Khabarovsk </LOCATION>, Gov. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> said. The document calls for increased trade and cultural, educational and informational exchanges between <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Khabarovsk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Terrritory </LOCATION>. It also establishes a committee of Alaskans and Soviets to oversee the agreement. `` This agreement makes formal the improved relationship we've established with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> over the past 18 months,'' <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> said in a news release Monday `` I'm confident it will lead to new business opportunities for Alaskans and a better understanding of our two systems by people from both countries.'' Talks between the two sides will cover tourism, regional problems, science, technology, economics, art, literature, youth and sports, according to the agreement. The <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> delegation, which returned Saturday, also signed protocols with officials of <LOCATION> Vladivostok </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Magadan </PERSON> to allow for formal trade and cultural exchanges, <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Khabarovsk </LOCATION> is a city of 500,000 residents on the <LOCATION> Amur </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Vladivostok </LOCATION>, which until recently had been closed to Westerners, is south of <LOCATION> Khabarovsk </LOCATION> on the Sea of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Magadan </PERSON> is to the north, on the Sea of <LOCATION> Okhotsk </LOCATION>.

 Can Sears really do it? Can an old-style merchant adopt a 1980s retailing strategy, and fast? Those were the questions Tuesday, one day after the nation's largest retailer announced a drastic shift in its merchandising strategy in an effort to recapture lost profits Optimism was running low that <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, struggling to catch up to its younger and more successful competitors, could pull off such a fundamental change in the way it does business. `` You can bring your prices down, but it's going to take awhile to change your image,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ronning </PERSON>, a retail industry analyst with the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harriman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it was switching to a policy of everyday low pricing and away from the `` regular'' prices and frequent sales the 102-year-old retailer has been known for <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, stung by three consecutive quarters of declining profits, announced the change as part of a restructuring that also included the planned sale of the <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and the company's <ORGANIZATION> Coldwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> commercial real estate subsidiary, as well as a buyback of 10 percent of its 380 million outstanding shares The company said it would concentrate on consumer-oriented businesses _ retailing, insurance, residential real estate and financial services. These changes, however sweeping, are easy compared with the task of changing the public's perception of <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>. The company is seen as a stodgy, old-fashioned retailer, where you can get good car batteries and appliances, but it's no longer the store many consumers think of first before they go shopping. In terms of raw sales numbers, <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> runs far ahead of the nation's other big retailers. Through September, the company racked up $ 20.17 billion in sales, compared to $ 16.92 billion at <ORGANIZATION> K </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, and $ 12.32 billion at <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. But <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> has failed to keep up with retail trends and changing American lifestyles, and discount and specialty stores have eroded the company's market share by offering wider selection and more exciting shopping atmospheres. `` They've been criticized for losing the old <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> customer who goes to shop somewhere else for lower prices,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, an analyst with <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Ball </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Turben </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. One of the company's biggest rivals, 25-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION>, rocketed to the forefront of the retailing industry on the same everyday low pricing strategy that <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> is now embracing <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION>'s sales have risen at a double-digit percentage rate while other retailers have eked out much smaller gains during a continuing retail sales slump. `` There's an increasing awareness that the everyday low pricing policy is the successful way to go in the current marketplace,'' said <PERSON> Ronning </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Brown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brothers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harriman </LOCATION> analyst. In spite of that growing awareness, <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> continued to offer periodic sales on items that were regularly priced most of the time. Noted <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, `` Their customer does n't read the paper enough times to follow when the promotions are.'' As a result, consumers who wanted to be sure of a better price went to stores like <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION>, K mart and other discounters, abandoning <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> in the process. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> also has been slow to adopt other successful retailing strategies. The company only recently began selling national brand appliances next to its <LOCATION> Kenmore </LOCATION> line, although specialty retailers like <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> have drawn customers away by providing more variety. And even when <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> added names like <ORGANIZATION> Maytag </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Panasonic </ORGANIZATION> to its appliance line several years ago and saw its sales go up, <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> stuck by its private label. The slow pace of change at <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> is what casts doubt on the company's ability to turn its sales around. Analysts, looking beyond the company's selling floor, are concerned by the unwieldy bureaucracy that has clung to tradition. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> noted that the company recently set up two separate buying operations for its store and catalog divisions, which serve very different customers. `` That should have been done earlier,'' he said. He said Tuesday of <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' plans: `` We'll see.'' <PERSON> Ronning </PERSON> said the company must undertake a major advertising program to persuade customers to come back. `` <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> has to show the consumer it is competitively priced and they have to do something to make the store somewhat more exciting,'' he said. Investors also seemed unsure about prospects for a turnaround. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> stock was unchanged at $ 41.75 a share in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading Tuesday, after having fallen $ 1.87 -LCB- following the announcement Monday.

<HEAD>Say World Gold Production Will Rise For Next Four Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The 57 gold-mining countries will produce 57.979 million troy ounces of gold this year, an 8 percent increase over the 1987 figure, the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> says. Gold production will increase by 9 percent to 63.427 million ounces next year, 4 percent in 1990 and 2 percent in 1991, the institute said in a statistical report. The report, released last week, was made with the participation of 294 mining concerns, which supplied the institute with production figures and projections. The report made no price predictions on gold, currently trading around $ 412 an ounce. It said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the largest producer, will produce 19.6 million ounces this year, 33.8 percent of the total. The Soviet Union, No. 2, will produce 9.3 million ounces or 16 percent and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, No. 3, will produce 5.8 million ounces, or 10 percent. According to institute projections, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> will remain the top producer in 1991, with production up to 20.7 million ounces. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> production should rise to 7.4 million ounces by 1991, 10.9 percent of the total, but still in third place behind the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> at 10.2 million ounces or 15.1 percent of total output. The institute is the world's largest association of gold miners, refiners, suppliers and manufacturers.

<DATELINE>BURBANK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> judge on Tuesday ordered <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to give investor <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Disney </PERSON> the names and addresses of workers who participate in an employee stock plan, handing <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> a minor victory in his battle to buy the instant film company. The ruling by <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Vice-Chancellor <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Berger </PERSON>, if unchallenged, would ease the way for <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> to promote his hostile $ 2.6 billion buyout offer to <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> employees. The ruling was announced here late Tuesday by <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Shamrock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The case is in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> court because that is where Polaroid is incorporated. A spokeswoman at <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Marcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, would not comment when asked if <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> would appeal the decision. <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s new employee stock ownership plan, created as part of a recent restructuring, is seen by some as an anti-takeover defense. Disney, nephew of famed animator <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Disney </PERSON>, has made his buyout offer conditional on dismantling of the plan. <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> had refused a Shamrock request for a list of names and addresses of employees in the plan. That legal wrangle is separate from a suit by <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>, also in <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, seeking an order blocking <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>'s $ 42-a-share tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> stock Trial of that suit is set to begin Thursday. In another development Tuesday, <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> extended the deadline for acceptance of its tender offer from Monday to Nov. 17, and said about 6.8 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> stockholders had offered to sell their shares as of Monday. A parallel offer from Shamrock offers $ 44 a share if <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> management negotiates a friendly takeover.

<HEAD>New York Post to Launch Sunday Edition</HEAD>

 The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's oldest continuously published daily newspaper, announced Tuesday it would start a Sunday edition, just months after it narrowly averted extinction. The tabloid newspaper is to begin a Sunday edition March 5. It will sell for $ 1. Plans to launch it came after `` repeated requests and offers of support from our major advertisers and dealers,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalikow </PERSON>, who bought the Post from <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> in March. <PERSON> Kalikow </PERSON> also predicted the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, after years of losing money, would begin to show a profit sometime next year. Current losses are `` in a range that are acceptable to me,'' he said, but declined to provide specifics. <PERSON> Kalikow </PERSON>, a real-estate development millionaire, said he would invest $ 25 million in the new Sunday edition next year and increase the paper's staff by about 60 people, including 30 reporters and editors. He said he expected an initial press run of 500,000 copies per Sunday. The Post was on the verge of ceasing publication until <PERSON> Kalikow </PERSON> and <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>, its owner since 1976, negotiated major concessions and buyouts from the paper's unions. Union reaction to the Sunday edition was favorable, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Pennacchio </PERSON>, secretary treasurer of the <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION>, which represents the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>'s editorial staff. Although New Yorkers already have their choice of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, the Daily News and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Newsday </LOCATION> on Sundays, <PERSON> Kalikow </PERSON> and Post Publisher <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON> say there is room for another. The Sunday Times sells for $ 1.25 while the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Newsday </ORGANIZATION> sell for $ 1. <PERSON> Kalikow </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>'s losses were a `` minor fraction'' of the $ 650,000 per week the tabloid was losing when he purchased it from <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> and that advertising was expanding. Average daily circulation was about 600,000 during October, he said. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Philo </PERSON>, an analyst who follows the newspaper industry for the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION>, said he did n't see a place in the city's highly competitive newspaper market for another Sunday paper and predicted it would only increase the financial drain on the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Judge Drops 14 Utilities From Securities Fraud Case</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: TOPS with 4 new grafs with judge signing order dropping 14
utility defendants from case. Picks up 4th graf pvs, The bondholders

<TEXT>
 A federal judge on Tuesday signed an order dropping 14 <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state utilities from the securities fraud trial stemming from the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supply </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 2.25 billion municipal bond default District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> signed the order hours after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> approved the federal government's share of a $ 226 million settlement announced Monday between the utilities and purchasers of municipal bonds used to build two defunct WPPSS nuclear power plants. <PERSON> Browning </PERSON>'s action, which he has taken with other defendants that have reached settlements, left <LOCATION> Snohomish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Public </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Utility </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> as the sole utility defendant in the trial, which is to reconvenes Wednesday. The bondholders claim in the suit that the utilities and other defendants lied and hid information that might have discouraged prospective investors in the WPPSS municipal bonds. <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> defaulted on the bonds in 1983 after scrapping the nuclear plants a year earlier. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> approved a $ 35 million settlement contribution by the <ORGANIZATION> Bonneville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, a power broker that markets electricity from dams in the <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> system. Boards and commissions for the 14 utilities approved settlement proposals Monday, bringing their total share to $ 181 million. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state will add $ 10 million to the settlement package, contingent on legislative approval. The <ORGANIZATION> Snohomish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utility </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> has until Nov. 10 to join the settlement by approving a $ 48.6 million contribution, said <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, an attorney for the bond purchasers. <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> said there was no indication what Snohomish would do. `` We have nothing to discuss with them,'' he said. `` They either take it or they do n't.'' The trial is expected to take on a new complexion now that the other utilities will be gone, he said. The plaintiffs will have to focus on the three other defendants _ <ORGANIZATION> Ebasco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION>, two engineering firms that built the unfinished plants, and <ORGANIZATION> Blyth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dillion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> financial adviser. `` The professional parties have n't been our main focus up to now,'' <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> said. `` There will be a greater concentration of effort to pinpoint the professionals' involvement.'' Those three defendants are sued by a class of more than 24,000 past and present bondholders. <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, a trustee for bondholders, sued only the utilities. <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> will remain in the case as long as Snohomish remains a defendant. There were more than 100 defendants in the fraud suit, but settlements left only 18 when the trial began Sept. 7. A total of $ 591 million in settlements plus $ 96 million in disputed insurance have been reached.

<HEAD>Dollar Lower, Stocks Firm In Tokyo Morning Session</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with morning Nikkei close, late
morning dollar trading, comments. No pickup.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar declined against the Japanese yen in Wednesday morning trading despite a third straight day of central bank intervention, while share prices held firm on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The dollar opened at 124.82 yen, down from Tuesday's close of 125.30 yen, and by late morning was changing hands at 124.68 yen. It was the first time since its June 10 opening of 124.72 yen that the dollar has opened below the 125-yen level. The <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> was intervening in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> shortly after the start of trading Wednesday to save the dollar from declining further, a dealer with the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> said. Traders said the central bank bought small amounts of dollars intermittently as the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency continued falling despite the reported intervention. The <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> customarily declines to comment on its monetary actions. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 31.13-point winner the previous day, finished the morning session up 6.21 points from Tuesday's close at 28,019.88. Share prices moved little because of profit-taking after a week of consecutive gains, dealers said. But participants still were strongly interested in buying a variety of issues, including steels, which helped the index maintain its rising trend, they said.
