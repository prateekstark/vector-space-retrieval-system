<HEAD>Opposition Leader Says Guatemala Lagging On Peace Accord</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GUATEMALA CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An opposition leader who was arrested when she returned from exile said Friday that <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> is lagging behind other Central American nations in seeking peace with rebels. <PERSON> Rigoberta </PERSON> <PERSON> Menchu </PERSON> and another activist were arrested Monday, then released after being held for seven hours. She returned to exile in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> on Friday. Despite her arrest, Ms. <PERSON> Menchu </PERSON> said she moved freely during her stay here, despite periodic death threats that she called `` normal and of not much importance.'' She said she and three other members of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guatemalan </ORGANIZATION> had discussed with Roman Catholic Archbishop <PERSON> Prespero </PERSON> <PERSON> Penados </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrio </PERSON> whether exiles can safely return to <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>. `` We had great success,'' she said at the airport before departing for <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, but gave no details. Travel plans of the the other exiles, <PERSON> Rolando </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> <PERSON> Montalvo </PERSON>, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Rue </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marta </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON>, were not known. Ms. <PERSON> Menchu </PERSON> and <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> <PERSON> Montalvo </PERSON> were arrested and charged with crimes `` against the internal security of the nation,'' but a judge subsequently dismissed the charges for lack of evidence. Speaking with reporters at the airport, Ms. <PERSON> Menchu </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> is far from meeting provisions of a Central American peace plan signed Aug. 7 by the presidents of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. `` I believe that this process still is just beginning to begin -LRB- in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> -RRB- because ... in other countries of the Central American region there have been more concrete things, there have been more realistic things than there have been in our country,'' she said.

<HEAD>Radio Says Bofors Bribed Indian Family for Weapons Contract</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Swedish radio said Friday it had obtained documents supporting allegations that a family of Indian financiers received $ 13.7 million in connection with a Swedish arms sale to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. It said the documents included telex messages between the Swedish firm <ORGANIZATION> AB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION> and two <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> banks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in 1986 dealing with accounts under the control of London-based members of the <PERSON> Hinduja </PERSON> family. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Hindu </ORGANIZATION> also reported the allegations. <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinduja </PERSON>, one of four brothers active in the family operations, called the information `` a complete fabrication'' in a statement to the Hindu. <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Per </PERSON> <PERSON> Mossberg </PERSON> was quoted as denying the allegations. The telex messages indicated the account holder was promised a 10 percent commission on a $ 1.4 billion Indian contract for 155mm howitzers made by <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s largest arms manufacturer, the Swedish radio said. It described the <PERSON> Hindujas </PERSON> as being close to Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> and his <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The broadcast said money from <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION> passed through accounts held by the <PERSON> Hinduja </PERSON> family at the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. It claimed the deposits were transferred to <ORGANIZATION> Sangam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, a company <ORGANIZATION> Swedish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> said was owned by the <PERSON> Hinduja </PERSON> family. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s government was facing allegations of corruption when it negotiated the deal with <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 and made the condition that no middlemen be used. A Swedish investigation last June found that <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION> paid up to $ 40 million to individuals, but the company legally blocked access to further information. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> committee dealing with the case adopted its final report Friday, but the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> said investigators had `` drawn a blank.'' The report was not made public. It is to be presented to Parliament next Friday. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> pledged anew that the government would punish any Indian who profited from the deal illegally, <ORGANIZATION> UNI </ORGANIZATION> said. He was in <LOCATION> Madras </LOCATION> for a two-day <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> meeting.

 Marines who landed on an Iranian oil platform after it was battered by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships found weapons that may have been used against American helicopters, the commander of the attack said. Capt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, who heads <ORGANIZATION> Destroyer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Squadron </ORGANIZATION> 9, said the attack on the <LOCATION> Sassan </LOCATION> oil platform bore out <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> claims that the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> facility was being used for military purposes. `` We believe that <ORGANIZATION> Sassan </ORGANIZATION> was a communications and surveillence station,'' said <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>. `` We found weapons, ammunition and communications gear.'' <ORGANIZATION> Sassan </ORGANIZATION>, one of two Iranian oil rigs attacked by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces on Monday, was destroyed in an operation that began with a two-ship naval bombardment followed by a helicopter assault. It ended with an assault by <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>. demolition specialists who blew up the remaining facilities. `` We've gotten pretty beat up for our combined operations in the past ... but I thought this was just about perfect,'' <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> said during an interview on the bridge of this San Diego-based warship. <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> declined to speculate on how the Iranians used <LOCATION> Sassan </LOCATION>, other than for surveillance of shipping, but an officer aboard this destroyer said the weapons recovered were types associated with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s armed speedboat operations in the gulf. After the shelling, the Marines who assaulted the platform found 23mm guns, primarily anti-aircraft weapons. Officers said it was most likely one of those weapons fired on two helicopters from the guided missile frigate <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> on March 5. Although the helicopters were not hit, the incident was cited by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials as one of the reasons for Operation Praying Mantis. Another reason was the mining of the frigate <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> on April 14. The 4,500-ton <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON>, a guided-missile destroyer brought into the gulf from its battle group station in the <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, and the 7,818-ton destroyer <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> fired 133 5-inch shells at the platform. <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> said that at <LOCATION> Sassan </LOCATION>, `` the destruction was complete. It was pretty beat up by the naval gunfire, and the demolition charges made one hell of an explosion. `` It was obscured in smoke and flame. It's certainly uninhabitable at this point.'' <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>' unit gave the Iranians at <LOCATION> Sassan </LOCATION> a five-minute warning that they were about to be attacked. About 29 workers on the platform quickly boarded two tugboats that were tied up under the living quarters platform at <LOCATION> Sassan </LOCATION> and got out of the way. Some Iranians who had stayed behind fired at the <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON> and the <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> with one of three Soviet-made 23mm guns placed on the three-tiered, southernmost deck. Although the twin-barrelled weapon has a range of four miles, the rounds fell short of the ships, which were about two miles from the platform. <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> said one of the tugboats radioed for permission to return to the platform and pick up another group of about 38 still aboard. The request was granted and a 45-minute evacuation took place while the ships held their fire. Radio traffic indicated only two Iranian casualties at <LOCATION> Sassan </LOCATION>, one dead and one wounded, but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officers said there may have been more.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is moving to fill one <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> slot and Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> is appointing temporary replacements for up to a dozen others in an attempt to end the turmoil caused by the March 29 protest resignations of two key <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> aides. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Friday moved quickly to ease <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s personnel problems by nominating <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> to fill the associate attorney general's slot, the department's empty No. 3 post. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> should stay in office and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is running `` just fine,'' although two top <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> aides who quit told <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Wednesday a `` deep malaise'' had `` infected'' the department and one of them said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> should be indicted. <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> would replace <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Trott </PERSON>, who left the department a week ago to become a federal judge. His was not one of the protest resignations, but the vacancy has been affected by the concern with <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s leadership. <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, an assistant <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary, may come in to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on an acting basis late next week until he can be confirmed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The Nos. 2 and 3 offices at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> are virtually vacant from the top down, and the department plans to shore them up by naming perhaps nearly a dozen people in all, department spokesman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Korten </PERSON> said. The posts probably will be filled on Monday. <PERSON> Korten </PERSON> added, `` <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> absolutely has no intention of stepping down.'' An independent counsel has been examining <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s assistance to scandal-plagued <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and a proposed $ 1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline project at the behest of longtime friend <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>. Also under investigation are <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s meetings with regional <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> telephone company executives at a time when he owned $ 14,000 in <ORGANIZATION> Baby </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> stock and <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s role in securing a $ 40,000-a-year job for <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s wife. Since the protest resignations of Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has twice unsuccessfully tried to fill <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>' post. <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Arlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> rejected <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s overtures, and at least five current or former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys who have been sounded out about <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>'s job have said they were n't interested. <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON> withdrew from consideration for <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>' post Wednesday after adverse publicity about an alleged affair with his law firm's bookkeeper and other matters <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> was `` unequivocal'' at the White House meeting in telling the president that if it were up to him, he would seek an indictment of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, said an administration source who spoke on condition of anonymity. The former criminal division chief then proceeded to lay out `` an oral indictment'' of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> to the president, said the source, focusing on <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s relationship with <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> is under indictment in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> scandal. The administration source said <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> told the president that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> had violated the standards of ethical conduct for executive branch employees spelled out in a 1965 executive order. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, according to the source, said that in other similar instances of possible impropriety, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers would be placed on administrative leave, disciplined or dismissed. `` The president was very attentive,'' said the source, adding that `` it was clear he was hearing for the first time that not everything is well in <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>.'' The ethical standards say employees should avoid any action which could create the appearance of using public office for private gain, giving preferential treatment to any organization or person or making a government decision outside official channels. Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and White House counsel A.B. <PERSON> Culvahouse </PERSON> also attended the meeting. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was summoned to a 40-minute meeting with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> immediately afterward. According to <PERSON> Korten </PERSON>, the president told <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> at the end of their meeting that he was `` satisfied and supportive'' of the attorney general. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> left his post officially on Friday, 3 -LCB- weeks after resigning to protest <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s continued tenure as attorney general. Independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>, who has been conducting a criminal investigation of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> since last May 11, is expected to issue a report of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s activites if he does n't seek an indictment of the attorney general. It is likely the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Responsibility </ORGANIZATION> will then examine ethical questions raised as a result of <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s probe and will recommend to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> whether <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> should be disciplined or fired.

 A mammogram of <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s right breast shows no sign of cancer, the White House says. While the first lady went to <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> to have her six-month checkup following removal of her cancerous left breast, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had dental X-rays done there. The first couple flew by helicopter Friday to the suburban <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> military facility from the <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION>, remained there for less than a half-hour, then went to Camp David for the weekend. `` The president and first lady completed their routine radiological procedures,'' <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> physician Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> said. `` The president had a series of routine dental X-rays in the dental clinic, while Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had her first post-operative mammogram,'' he said. `` The mammogram was negative. No immediate treatment of any kind is required as a result of today's procedures on the president and first lady.'' The White House had said earlier that the examinations were not prompted by any current physicial problems of either of the Reagans. The Reagans did not answer reporters' questions when they left the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> or on arrival or departure from the hospital. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, however, made an `` A-OK'' thumb-and-forefinger sign, indicating things went well. The last time the 77-year-old president visited the hospital was in January, when he underwent his semi-annual checkup for colon cancer. He has had regular checkups every January and June since he underwent surgery for an intestinal malignancy in July 1985. <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s press secretary, said, `` It's wise and routine to check the other breast'' after surgery of the kind the first lady had six months ago. She said the first lady has had periodic examinations since her operation Oct. 17, 1987, but this was her first X-ray of the right breast. Mrs. <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> said the couple wanted to have the results of Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s exam promptly `` so they could send her off for a comfortable, worry-free weekend.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, 66, had her breast removed after doctors discovered a quarter-inch cancerous lesion. She chose to undergo a modified radical mastectomy, which involves the removal of the entire breast and some lymph nodes. Mrs. <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> said that not only was it time for the first lady's six-month checkup, but the president could use the time `` to get his dental X-rays taken, rather than usually doing it at the White House. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> usually has a cleaning and checkup every three months at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, but that the president planned to have a `` panoramic'' X-ray done this time in order to get a full-view picture of his mouth. The White House has X-ray machines that take pictures of parts of the mouth, but does not have the larger machine that pans the entire mouth area, he said. Panoramic radiographs, or X-rays that provide an overall view of the teeth and jaws, are used to diagnose problems ranging from cavities to tumors.

<TEXT>
 A host of current and former top government officials are listed as prosecution witnesses for the Iran-Contra conspiracy trial of Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> and three co-defendants. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and two top deputies and Attorney <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and two of his top aides are among the list of 105 witnesses submitted in a court filing Friday by independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>. The list includes national security officials knowledgeable about the covert sale of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, private operatives who ran the secret supply network that armed the Nicaraguan rebels, <PERSON> Contra </PERSON> leaders and wealthy donors who contributed to their cause. No date has been set for the trial of North, former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and two arms dealers: retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>. They are accused of conspiring to divert profits illegally from the U.S.-Iran arms sales to help the Contras during a ban on direct American military aid to the rebels. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> filed the witness list in advance of Monday's hearing called by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> to determine if prosecutors impermissibly relied on evidence derived from the compelled congressional testimony of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>. Most of the witnesses were known to <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> before <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> received congressional immunity on April 20, 1987. The list includes deputy <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>, former White House chief of staff <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>, former national security adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> and assistant attorneys general <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> would be expected to testify about the November 1986 investigation they conducted that uncovered the diversion of arms-sale profits. The defense, meanwhile, indicated that it will call <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> as a witness during the hearing on the immunity question. The defense wants to show that statements he made to the grand jury were influenced by the defendants' compelled congressional testimony, according to court papers. Late Friday, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> issued an order blocking a defense attempt to subpoena nine members of <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s staff to testify at the hearing. Seven of the prospective trial witnesses are referred to only by number `` because of national security concerns,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said. Their identities were given privately to the court and the defense. Other top officials on the list include Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> legal adviser <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON> and former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> general counsel <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Sporkin </PERSON>, now a federal judge here. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, who pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of withholding information from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about covert aid to the Contras, is one of several former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> officials on the list, which includes <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s former secretary <PERSON> Fawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>. Contra leaders <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> and <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> Robelo </PERSON> are listed along with retired <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> Maj. Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Singlaub </PERSON>, who helped raise private money for the anti-Sandinista cause. Donors <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Garwood </PERSON>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Boyle </PERSON>, and <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Claggett </PERSON>, Jr. are listed along with <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Haskell </PERSON>, who owned land in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> where an airstrip was built for resupply operations. Also on the list were two conservative fund-raisers, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> `` </PERSON> <PERSON> Spitz </PERSON>'' <PERSON> Channell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. <PERSON> Channell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> pleaded guilty last year to conspiring illegally to use a tax-exempt foundation to help raise Contra money. The defense indicated it also wanted to call <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> deGraffenreid </PERSON> as witnesses at next week's hearing. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s office moved to disqualify the defense from calling any witnesses on the ground that the lawyers did not meet Thursday's deadline for notifying the prosecution of the grand jury witness they intended to produce at the hearing The prosecutor also argued that deGraffenreid and <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> were n't grand jury witnesses and therefore could n't testify at next week's The defense apparently wants to put <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> on the witness stand to show that testimony he gave to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, without immunity, was based on information he received from <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>, who gave closed-door testimony to the congressional committees before the public hearings began last spring.

<HEAD>Accutane Maker Will Devise New Safeguards On Use</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The maker of a popular anti-acne medication that can cause birth defects says it will try once again to devise a way to keep women from taking the prescription drug if they are pregnant or likely to become pregnant. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it has convened an advisory panel next Tuesday to consider reports that more pregnant women than previously believed are taking the drug Accutane despite strict warnings that it is likely to cause birth defects. Short of an outright ban, the agency has no way to guarantee the drug will not be used by women who are pregnant or become pregnant while taking it. And there was no indication whether the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> was actively considering ordering it off the market. The New Jersey-based maker _ <ORGANIZATION> Roche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> _ issued a statement late Friday saying it will propose a new series of safeguards at the Tuesday meeting. It said it will propose tighter restrictions on use of the drug in women of childbearing potential and offer to provide `` innovative blister-packaging to ensure that female patients receive the pregnancy warning with every prescription.'' The statement did not detail what type of restrictions the company will propose for the drug in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The drug is marketed in 40 countries worldwide. The warnings accompanying the drug since its introduction in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1982 are explicit: Do n't take the drug if you are pregnant and do n't get pregnant while you are taking it. <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> McLearn </PERSON> said Friday the agency's dermatologic drugs advisory committee has been asked to review use of Accutrane because `` we're concerned that a drug is not being used as the labeling indicates.'' `` The drug has all sorts of warnings that people who are pregnant should not be using it and that the drug is only for a very severe form of acne,'' said <PERSON> McLearn </PERSON>. `` It's clear that it's being used for a larger group than that. Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, a dermatologist from <ORGANIZATION> Beth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and a member of the advisory panel, emphasized that concern about the drug does not involve any new scientific discoveries, but rather new indications that some people are ignoring long-standing warnings of those effects. He said in a telephone interview Friday that the newly raised concern flows from a study of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Medicaid figures that suggests the frequency of people getting pregnant while on Accutane may be `` much higher than anybody thought it was.'' However, <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> said he has substantial questions about the accuracy of the projected pregnancy rate, since it was based on a `` very specialized population, namely people who are already on Aid to Families With Dependent Children because of prior unintended pregnancies.'' The question, he said, is not whether there is a problem, but how great the problem is for the estimated 1 million people _ a majority of them men _ who benefit from the drug. The <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> statistical projection says Accutane may have caused more than 1,000 babies to be born with birth defects in the past six years. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> has received reports of 62 birth defects associated with the drug from the time it came on the market in 1982, but scientists believe that may understate the problem simply because many side effects from any drug often are unrecognized and under-reported. Accutane is specifically intended for treatment of severe cystic acne, a type that often causes severe disfiguring and deep pitting scars and sometimes can be treated only with Accutane. Since the drug was approved in 1982, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Roche </LOCATION> _ a division of <ORGANIZATION> Hoffmann-La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> _ have strengthened the warning label, made repeated mailings of special letters to doctors and pharmacists emphasizing the risks and discussed the risks twice in the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> Drug Bulletin that is sent to more than 1 million health professionals. They also have distributed red warning stickers to pharmacists to be placed on each prescription bottle.

<HEAD>Sample Taken For Dating of Shroud Venerated As Christ's Burial
Cloth</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A tiny sample has been cut from the Shroud of <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION> for radiocarbon-dating that may determine whether the cloth existed at the time of <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>'s death on the cross, the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> announced. The linen, which appears to bear the image of a crucified man, is venerated by some as <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>'s burial cloth. The operation, eagerly awaited by scientists, was carried out Thursday in <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION> under the supervision of Cardinal <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballestrero </PERSON>, the Roman Catholic archbishop of <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, with the collaboration of Dr. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Tite </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Museum </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> said. The British Museum has agreed to guarantee the scientific validity of the carbon-dating, which is to be done independently on nuclear atom-counters at <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zurich </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>, which owns the shroud, had resisted carbon-dating on grounds it would damage the cloth, which is 14 feet, 3 inches long and 3 feet, 7 inches wide. But the development in the 1970s of an atom-counter known as an accelerator mass spectrometer made it possible to date objects with much smaller samples. The shroud, whose history is well-documented from the mid-14th century, has been kept in the Turin Cathedral since 1578. A piece of cloth measuring just 1 centimeter by 7 centimeters -LRB- four-tenths of an inch by 2.8 inches -RRB- was cut from the shroud, then cut further into three samples for the laboratories, Friday's <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> announcement said The size of the individual samples was not given, but Tite has previously said each laboratory would receive a 0.3-square-inch sample of the shroud. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> said the area of cutting was chosen to guarantee that the sample belongs to the principal body of the shroud and that the cut would cause `` the least damage possible to the cloth.'' It said the entire operation was videotaped and photographed. Each laboratory will also receive two dummy cloth samples, one carbon-dated and the other dated historically but not scientifically to see if they get consistent results for all three samples. The labs are not being told which sample is from the shroud, the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> said. Tite has said the triple carbon-dating should reveal the shroud's age within a 200-year range. The results are expected to be announced by summer. The tests will not prove that the image on the cloth is <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>'s, but would indicate whether the shroud existed when <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> was crucified. The shroud bears a faint yellowish image of both the front and back of a man's body. Stains, scientifically identified as blood, can be seen around the wrists. Believers contend the image was left by a supernatural burst of energy accompanying Christ's resurrection, while skeptics claim it was painted during the Middle Ages.

<HEAD>Destroyed Files Were Duplicates, Police Said</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Nearly 2,500 photographs from the <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> assassination file were destroyed because they were unneeded duplicates that took up filing space, a police spokesman says. Commander <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Booth </PERSON>, responding to questions about the destruction disclosed earlier this week, said Friday the explanation came from a retired police officer who was very involved in the case. He declined to give the officer's name, saying, `` He has been retired for some time and is disinclined to get involved.'' But he said the man `` has an independent recollection'' of events relating to the pictures. In the aftermath of <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s assassination at the Ambassador Hotel on June 5, 1968, he said, police took photographs of every possible angle of the crime scene. `` What happened is there were many hundreds of photographs taken, thousands of photographs,'' <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> said. `` And many copies of each photograph were copied for us and for each agency involved.'' `` What were destroyed were superfluous duplicates that amounted to a lot of redundancy,'' he said. `` There was no need to keep them. Filing space was a consideration.'' The police department's voluminous file on the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> assassination was released for the first time Tuesday, and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Archivist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> noted a certificate showing that 2,410 photographs were burned by police two months after <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s death Police earlier had conceded they destroyed ceiling panels and part of a door jamb from the kitchen of the Ambassador that became central to investigation of whether a second gun might have been fired at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> senator. <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON>, a Jordanian immigrant, was convicted of murdering <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and is serving a life term at <LOCATION> Soledad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prison </LOCATION>. He has said he was the lone assassin but insists he has no memory of the actual shooting. He blames alcohol for his amnesia. In another development, the woman who told police in 1968 that she saw a girl in a polka-dot dress run from the assassination scene declared she had been badgered into recanting her original story. The newly released police files showed that <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON> withdrew her statement two weeks after the killing, saying, `` The whole thing was a lie.'' But the woman, now <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Serrano-Sewell </PERSON>, told a radio reporter Thursday that she was a victim of police harassment. She had reported seeing a girl in a polka dot dress running from the Ambassador Hotel shouting, `` We shot him. We shot him.'' When she asked who was shot, she said the woman replied, `` Senator <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>.'' But her retraction of the story led police to cancel a search for such a girl, the files showed. In an interview with <ORGANIZATION> KUOP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Serrano-Sewell </PERSON> said, `` There was a lot of badgering that was going on. I was just 20 years old, and I became unglued. ... I said what they wanted me to say.'' Asked on Friday about the woman's statements, <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> said, `` Our conclusion was she did not tell the truth when she gave all that information. ... The files have to speak for themselves.''

 Deaf actress <PERSON> Marlee </PERSON> <PERSON> Matlin </PERSON> says she's unhappy with the way The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> treated her decision to speak without using sign language on the Academy Awards program.

 A reporter and a photographer from a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> newspaper were detained for about two hours Friday after the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said their rented boat entered a restricted area near a submarine shipyard. The reporter denied that the small boat had entered the restricted waters, which extend 100 feet into the <LOCATION> Thames </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> from the <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipyard </ORGANIZATION>, where submarines including nuclear-powered Tridents are built. The boat, rented by photographer <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Badz </PERSON> and reporter <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Romaner </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Jacksonville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Union </ORGANIZATION>, was stopped and boarded after it was spotted within the restricted area, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Lt.

<TEXT>
 The concrete and steel rubble from <LOCATION> L'Ambiance </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plaza </LOCATION> has long been cleared away, but the impact of the decade's most devastating construction accident still is being felt in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Lawmakers have been pushing for changes in construction-safety laws since the partially built <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, apartment complex collapsed one year ago today, leaving 28 workers dead. Proposals have ranged from tinkering with the accident reporting requirements and stiffening criminal penalties in fatal construction accidents to creating a separate construction agency outside the often-criticized <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. `` Obviously the price is too high in all the lives lost to ever think of it as having a silver lining,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, D-Conn. `` But given that all of that ca n't be changed, I do think it can be used ... to remind people in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and remind people in <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>'' of problems in the construction industry Rep. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Shays </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Conn </LOCATION>., who was a state representative when <PERSON> L'Ambiance </PERSON> collapsed, has devoted much of his time to the accident since coming to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to replace the late Rep. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> But the freshman congressman is frustrated at the slow-moving gears of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` Like most victims of crimes, you have the victims of L'Ambiance who are seeing a fairly unresponsive government, or at least a government that has responded slowly,'' <PERSON> Shays </PERSON> said in an interview this week. <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> said he is drafting legislation to increase criminal penalties for contractors convicted in fatal construction accidents. The current maximum penalty is six months in prison and a $ 10,000 fine for willful violation of <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> standards. At the request of lawmakers, <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> is reviewing whether to change its reporting standards. Under current regulations, only accidents with a death or at least five injuries have to be reported. <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> critics point to an accident in <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, shortly before the L'Ambiance collapse that involved the same contractor and the same type of problem that investigators say triggered the <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION> accident. But the <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION> accident went unreported because only one worker was injured. <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, who labeled the current reporting requirements `` absurd,'' believes knowledge of the <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION> accident could have prevented L'Ambiance. <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikelson </PERSON> said the reporting requirement is still under review. The agency also is reviewing its regulations on the lift-slab construction method used by <PERSON> L'Ambiance </PERSON> builders that was implicated in the collapse. Sen. <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Conn </LOCATION>., is pushing a measure that would put the L'Ambiance fines in a special trust fund for the victims' families <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON> fears the heavy fines will drive the contractors into bankruptcy, making them unable to pay damages that could be awarded in pending civil suits. Some lawmakers are embracing the idea of making a separate construction division within <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>, while the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> wants to create a separate construction agency. Congressional supporters said, however, that they do not expect action this year. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lapping </PERSON>, director of safety and health for the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Building </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trades </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said he does not hold out hope for significant changes because of L'Ambiance. `` In'78 we had the <LOCATION> Willow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> -LRB- cooling tower -RRB- accident -LRB- in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> -RRB- and we had 51 people killed there and nothing came out of that,'' Lapping said. Such criticism of <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> was reignited by the <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION> collapse, with charges that the agency has too few inspectors and relies too heavily on industry self-regulation. But <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> officials defend their policing policies. `` If <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, in its vision when it imagined what <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> would be like, wanted an inspector on every job site 24 hours a day, it would have said so,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Mikelson </PERSON>. `` It made employers accountable for safety and health, knowing full well the government would n't have inspectors at every site in the country.'' <PERSON> Mikelson </PERSON> also said <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> has made changes in recent years, including imposing heavier fines such as those at L'Ambiance and severely penalizing project contractors when they fail to properly oversee subcontractors. `` The bottom line is when employers show a strong commitment to safety and health, workers sustain far fewer injures,'' he said.

Going into the final weekend before <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s primary Tuesday, the two surviving Democratic hopefuls found little to disagree about in their first head-to-head debate Friday night in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. `` Any combination on this stage against <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ... will beat the Republicans in November,'' said civil rights leader <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` The two remaining _ and I guess that makes us the leading _ candidates for the Democratic nomination are the son of immigrants from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and a black man who grew up poor in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>,'' the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor told the hour-long debate in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. `` I think that says everything there is to say about his country.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, his nomination victory well in hand, spent Friday fishing in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Both Democrats headed back out across <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> today, looking for votes in the Tuesday balloting with 178 delegates at stake. A second debate was scheduled tonight in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. The good humor of the debate sponsored by the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Democratic party stood in sharp contrast to the harsh racial and religious overtones of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary only a week ago. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> insisted it is a close race for the Democratic nomination, but <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is firmly in the front-runner's spot with a widening lead in the national delegate battle and a substantial edge in the polls for the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> primary. Who will fill the No. 2 spot on the Democratic ticket occupied much of the debate. It has also dominated the Democratic campaign since <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won his big <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> victory to become the odds-on favorite to win the presidential nomination at the party convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> in July. `` It's a bit premature to be giving out coronation roses for the governor and taps for me,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said when asked if he would accept the No. 2 spot. `` We're now moving into the last lap of a significant race, and I'm a long-distance runner. I look forward to it.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who has denied even thinking about a running mate, then turned to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and asked softly: `` Are you interested?'' After the audience's laughter subsided, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> smiled and replied, `` You got it, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had a curt response to a question of whether he believed polls showing <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as the vice presidential nominee would cost Democrats the White House in the fall elections: `` No.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> drew his share of laughter as well, in response to a question about how the Democrats could win the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> in the general election. `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on my ticket will win the South,'' the preacher-turned-politician said. The only harsh words of the day were directed at Republicans. `` First of all, the drug program of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is to have the First Lady to say ` Just say no,' the president to just cut the budget, and Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to just say and do nothing,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said during the debate. Earlier, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> fails to understand what it takes to `` build an economic future and to create good jobs.'' `` I do n't see how we are going to bring good jobs and good wages back to the industrial <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> unless we work together,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>. `` If the vice president does n't understand that, then he should n't be running for president.'' Both men told reporters after the debate that keeping the focus on winning in the fall was the correct course. The only differences between the two in the debate were not major ones. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> praised plant-closing legislation, saying he had used a state law like the one now before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to save thousands of jobs in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said reinvesting in the nation is more important. He also pressed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> seriously on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, suggesting that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s strong stand against terrorism should be applied to that nation and its `` state-sponsored terrorism.'' `` I would be very tough on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor replied.

 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders say they wo n't be pushed into approving the U.S.-Soviet arms control treaty to meet a White House deadline of ratifying the historic pact before President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s trip to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in late May The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> still needs to nail down answers to questions about whether the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty bans futuristic weapons as well as existing missiles, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said Assurances by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and a top Soviet official that both superpowers agree the treaty does ban future types of weapons are n't enough, said <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> `` We need to make sure, be absolutely clear,'' said <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, speaking of the issue of how the pact affects weapons such as lasers or particle beam weapons. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> told his colleagues: `` I did not set the date of the summit, I had nothing to do with it. This <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is no president's rubber stamp and this senator is no president's man. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had said Thursday that he hopes the pact is approved in time for him to take a ratification notice to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for his May 29-June 2 meeting with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, asked whether failure to ratify the pact would affect the summit, said, `` I think it would be very upsetting and it would put a strain on the summit.'' When the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> finally does vote, ratification is likely, said <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>. Ratification requires 67 votes, and <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leaders have said they believe 90 of the 100 senators will support the pact. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said the futuristic weapons issues could be settled by an amendment to the pact. The administration has urged ratification without any amendments and will likely portray <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>'s proposal as `` a killer amendment,'' he said. But `` I do n't see this as a killer amendment.'' A so-called killer amendment is one attached to a treaty that could make it unacceptable to the parties that negotiated the agreement, and thus `` kill'' the treaty. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the questions should be answered, but noted, `` there is an advantage to having this ratified'' before the summit begins Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, also said he supports speedy ratification so that `` we can keep this momentum toward arms control.'' The treaty would ban nuclear missiles with a range of 300 to 3,400 miles.

<HEAD>Department Sets Up Task Force To Monitor Drought</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> secretly created a special drought task force seven weeks ago to keep track of dry weather that threatened much of the West. Officials announced Friday that the task force was set up by <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> on March 1 and had been meeting weekly in his office. No mention of the nature of the meeting was evident in his published daily schedules or in those of senior aides. But the dry weather has since prompted many reports of drought around the country since then, and there have been repeated references to it in the news media in those affected areas, said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> director of information. So it was decided to go public about <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s task force. <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> defended the secrecy, saying: `` It was more of a review of the situation than anything else. If we had put out some big announcement, we might have looked like we were trying to pat ourselves on the back.'' <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> appointed Deputy Secretary <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> as chairman of the panel. Others include heads of <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> agencies mostly closely associated with farm programs, credit and other resources that might be needed. In his statement announcing the task force, <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said that <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> is stepping up contact with state agriculture departments in the affected areas so those can `` provide us with a constant flow of information regarding the moisture situation and preparations'' for relief. The <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> and other western states, which suffered through drought last year, appear to be the prime regions for another drought spell in 1988, with several states reporting February and March being the driest on record, he said. Conditions likely to cause problems for agricultural producers were said to prevail in parts of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. Some other states are having extremely dry weather in smaller areas, raising concerns that forest fires could be severe this year. <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said that several of the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> agency administrators report that their state and county offices in the dry areas have been received numerous inquiries about various federal drought assistance programs. In a related report on the outlook for western water supplies, Wilson Scaling, chief of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Soil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said that in March, for the second month in a row, precipitation was well below normal in the West. He said parts of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> reported the driest February and March combination on record. But some areas improved last month, including the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>, the western Gulf of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, the northern Cascade range, the Colorado-Wyoming border, and most parts of <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> reported its first month of above-average precipitation in over a year,'' Scaling said. `` We are encouraged by that eading.''

 A quarterly report by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> shows cattle feedlot inventories in the nation's 13 leading beef states totaled 9.37 million head as of April 1, up 6 percent from a year ago and 5 percent above two years ago. Only <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> showed decreases from April 1, 1987, while cattle numbers in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> were virtually unchanged. Increases were reported for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Marketings of fed cattle for slaughter during January, February and March totaled 5.81 million head, a 1 percent increase from the same period of 1987 and also 1 percent more than in 1986, the report said Friday. The placement of new cattle and calves on feed during the first quarter of the year totaled 5.8 million head, up 2 percent from last year and 10 percent more than two years ago. Cattle feeders indicated they expect to market 5.93 million head during April, May and June, up 6 percent from second-quarter levels of last year and 2 percent more than two years ago. State feedlot cattle inventories are listed here for the 13 states, which account for about 85 percent of the nation's beef. The first number is the number of cattle, in thousands, as of April 1, and the second number is the percentage of a year earlier.

<HEAD>Investigator Says Mob Organized Into `Cells' Like Terrorist Groups</HEAD>

 An investigator who almost became the first <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent inducted into an organized crime family says he was pulled out of the mob by his <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> superiors after being ordered to kill a gangster from a rival group. `` The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> felt _ and so did I _ that this was a good time for getting out, because everybody was being killed,'' <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pistone </PERSON> told senators, explaining that he was given the hit assignment during a mob civil war. <PERSON> Pistone </PERSON> also told members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Permanent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> on Investigations there's a `` surprising similarity'' between the structure of organized crime families and terrorist groups. He said `` a strict need-to-know policy is enforced,'' and fellow mobsters often avoid telling each other their last names. <PERSON> Pistone </PERSON>, who spent six years working undercover with the mob, said he was scheduled to become a `` made'' member of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Bonanno </PERSON> family in December 1981 The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> abruptly ended his operation a half-year after two <PERSON> Bonanno </PERSON> factions began a civil war, he said. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> said that to this day, no agent has ever become a formal `` made'' member of the mob rather than an associate. <PERSON> Pistone </PERSON> testified from behind a screen because he has been relocated and changed his appearance. But he has told his story before, in court testimony and in a book on his six years posing as a small-time but successful jewel thief and burglar, <PERSON> Donnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brasco </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pistone </PERSON>'s testimony in trials resulted in more than 200 indictments and more than 100 convictions of organized crime members. Explaining the workings of mob families, <PERSON> Pistone </PERSON> said: `` There is a surprising similarity which marks the inner-workings of the Mafia and contemporary terrorist organizations. `` The families are broken down into small, separate cells, commonly called crews. `` In all likelihood, a member of one crew may not even know who are the members of another crew in his own family.'' He said `` gambling is probably the most important source of income'' for traditional organized crime families. Gambling supports other mob activities, such as drug buys, payoffs, lawyer's fees, and investments into legitimate businesses, he said

President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> last year outlined a program last year under which government and industry will work together to find commercial uses for high-temperature superconductors, which can conduct electricity without energy loss. `` Superconductors ... have great potential in such areas as electrical generation, storage and transmission, computers, communications, medical diagnostics and transportation,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. `` However, the newly discovered materials will require extensive research and development.'' All three laboratories have been active in superconductivity research and have the facilities and expertise needed to make the technology marketable, <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Yost Says Coast Guard Patrol Cuts Could Be Leading To Drug Trade
Increase</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The head of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> says severe cutbacks in air and sea drug patrols by the financially strapped agency could be leading to an increase in drug trafficking along <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> coasts. `` The smugglers, when they ship, do n't send us an invoice,'' said Adm. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> `` But we do have intelligence that indicates the awareness by the smugglers that the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> has cut back its patrols by ship and by air. `` I can only surmise that that influences their shipping schedules'' and that there is `` some intention of taking advantage of that,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, faced with a $ 100 million budget shortfall, earlier this year permanently shut down dozens of stations, resulting in $ 40 million in savings. To cover the remaining $ 60 million, <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> ordered a 55 percent across-the-board reduction of sea and air missions for drug interdiction and routine search-and-rescue patrols. The cutbacks have been in effect for about three months. `` Fifty-five percent of my ships are sitting alongside the dock and planes are on the runways,'' the commandant said in interviews this week with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think that's a travesty,'' he said. `` I really think the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people, having paid money for the ships and aircraft, and ... paying the salary of the young men and women who they've trained to do these jobs, to have them sitting on the runway and tied up at the dock That ought to make the taxpayer angry.'' Last month, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> urged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to transfer $ 60 million in other <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> funds, such as <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>, mass transit and highway projects, to the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> to bring the patrols back up to last year's levels. But <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has yet to act. <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> said he believes he is caught in the middle of two political realities on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, and that he is coming out on the short end. `` What I see there is every member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> hates drugs and supports and loves the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, particularly members of our appropriations subcommittees,'' <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> said. `` But they are forced to choose between drug interdiction and mass transit'' projects in their districts. `` I would guess very few of those members are saying, ` Take my money,''' he said. <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> said he sympathized with the chairmen of the transportation funding panels, Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, and Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>. `` They're both strong supporters of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, and yet they have a very difficult time taking money from their grant programs to properly fund the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said A <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> aide said the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee may take up the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s funding request this week.

<HEAD>Rep. Price Remembered As Advocate For Military, Servant To
Constituents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Rep. <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Democrat elected in the waning days of World War II who rose to second in House seniority, was remembered at his death as a loyal servant to his constituents and a strong advocate for the nation's military. Price, 83, died Friday of cancer at <LOCATION> Malcolm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Andrews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>. He was serving his 22nd term in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, a tenure surpassed only by 24-term Rep. <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitten </PERSON>, D-Mass. Price, who had announced two years ago this would be his last term in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, for 10 years chaired the chamber's <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. He was ousted from that post in January 1985 by younger Democrats seeking a more vigorous watchdog on the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's military policies. During his tenure as head of the committee, Price had presided over the drive to beef up the nation's arms stockpile with the MX missile, the B-1 bomber, a nuclear aircraft carrier and a vast array of other hardware. A proposed amendment to the Pentagon budget bill pending in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would name a new Trident missile-firing submarine for Price. He considered himself a staunch supporter of administration requests for military spending regardless of which party was in power, acknowledging the committee under his aegis was somewhat of a `` rubber stamp'' for the Pentagon. `` In many ways, it is,'' Price once said. `` I'd rather be criticized for being for something than have to alibi when we need it and we do n't have it.'' Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, D-Wis., who replaced Price as chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, called him `` a fair, evenhanded, thoughtful member'' with `` a quiet grace that will be missed around <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Price had suffered in recent years from arthritis and diabetes, and learned in the last month that he had pancreatic cancer, said administrative assistant <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Mansfield </PERSON>. He went to the hospital early Friday complaining of pain and died in the early evening. Price, who had been a sports writer in the 1920s, grew up along the banks of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. He came to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as an aide at the start of the New Deal and won election while serving as an enlisted man in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. He took office in 1945, as the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> was closing in on <PERSON> Adolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s bunker. <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>' two Democratic senators said Price's impact on his state and on the nation's military would continue. `` <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON> was a man of the people who kept a common touch after reaching great heights. He moved from being an Army corporal to contributing in a major way to the nation's defense,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>. Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said Price `` had absolutely no peer in service to his constituency. He was my mentor and close personal friend.

<HEAD>New Rules Designed To Prevent Trauma To Show Horses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 New rules regulating the hoof pads used on Tennessee Walking Horses and other show horses take effect Monday in an effort to prevent the use of cruel methods to give the animals a distinctive gait. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> regulations will be phased in gradually to prevent trauma to show horses, many of which currently have pads that are four inches high, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Glosser </PERSON>, acting administrator of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` To remove four-inch pads abruptly could cause stress on a horse's feet and limbs,'' he said. From April 25 through July 31, pads may be no more than three inches high; from Aug. 1 through Oct. 31, two inches; and, effective Nov. 1, no more than one-half inch high covering the sole of the foot. At that time, however, an additional half-inch-high `` rim'' pad will be allowed between the full pad and the shoe. All pads must be made of leather or other similar soft, pliable material. <PERSON> Glosser </PERSON> said the new rules prohibit chains or rollers that weigh more than six ounces, including the weight of the fastener. Weights on the hoof other than the specified pads are also prohibited, except for horseshoes weighing up to 16 ounces. The Horse Protection Act was passed in 1970 to eliminate the practice of `` soring'' to produce special gaits in horses. `` Soring is the use of cruel methods, devices or chemical substances on a horse's legs or feet that can reasonably be expected to cause a horse to experience pain when walking,'' the agency said in its statement. `` Soring is done primarily to alter a horse's gait in the show ring.'' The new interim rules apply to all breeds of horses at shows or sales, the agency said. Agency officials will continue to monitor horse shows and work with the industry to prevent soring, he said. `` If we find sored horses, we will take action against the responsible parties, regardless of the devices used,'' <PERSON> Glosser </PERSON> said. On March 21, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> here, in a lawsuit brought against <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Horse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, invalidated certain sections of the department's horse protection regulations. In the court order and a clarifying order issued April 13, the court directed <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> to initiate rulemaking to eliminate devices that could reasonably be expected to cause soring, the agency said. The court specifically referred to pads and chains used on the front feet and legs of horses to alter their gaits.

<DATELINE>COLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 College students in 10 states and three countries are linking up by computer to simulate global bargaining for peace. But they're finding make-believe hostilities are often as touchy as in real life. In the first few days of the exercise this semester, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> rejected <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s offer to end their war as `` treachery'' and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> dispatched a flurry of communiques calling the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` offensive.'' The 700 students are playing diplomat as part of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communication </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Negotiation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Simulations </ORGANIZATION> program, based at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're not doing an adequate job in American education of teaching how to live and function in an interdependent world,'' said <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkenfeld </PERSON>, a government and politics professor at the college who co-directs the program. `` It's only been in recent years that we have discovered a need to become more of a part of issues that other countries find important.'' One scenario envisioned by the students, who work six months in the future, proved all too real. `` We assassinated -LRB- <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> about three months before it really happened,'' said <PERSON> Wilkenfeld </PERSON>, who encourages students to seek solutions through peaceful negotiation. `` We felt badly about that.'' ICONS began in 1981 with a grant from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. In its early days, the program involved three or four universities. This semester, 15 universities are participating through computer links from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. The computer also links <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> students to others in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Messages during the five-week simulation often are sent in foreign languages and must be translated with care so sensitive correspondence is not misunderstood. With students living in various time zones, setting up computer conferences often becomes a logistical nightmare. The simulations are based on a scenario of world events written before the game begins each semester. The scenario takes what's happening in the world and projects it six to eight months ahead, <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> said That way, students are not tempted to read newspapers and magazines looking for negotiating tips and strategies, she said. In the first few days of this semester's simulation, the Soviets, played by students at <ORGANIZATION> Brigham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Provo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, sent out more than 100 messages, said <PERSON> Doreen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bass </PERSON>, simulation director and a member of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION>'s research faculty. `` A lot of it was cold war rhetoric and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> -LRB- students at <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> -RRB- sent a response saying it was not pleased with what it called propaganda,'' <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> said. Two days later, the `` Soviets'' rebutted: `` The Soviet leadership and people were deeply wounded and pained by the offensive and insensitive communique received from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this week,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Brigham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> team wrote. `` We are all concerned and troubled to find that the cold war still rages in the hearts of American leaders.'' Meanwhile, the Iranian team, played by a different group of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> students, was busy composing a reply to the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> team's offer to terminate its involvement in the Iran-Iraq war `` <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> sent out a message saying they were unilaterally withdrawing from the war, returning all Iranian POWs, returning all borders to original pre-war positions,'' said <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinchuck </PERSON>, a member of the Iranian team. `` We flatly rejected it and said it was ` filled with duplicity and treachery and horrific lies.'''

<TEXT>
 A Japanese man linked by authorities to the terrorist <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> has been indicted for carrying pipe bombs on the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Turnpike </LOCATION>, officials said. <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON>, 35, was charged with three counts of interstate transport of explosive devices, three counts of possessing unregistered explosive devices and three counts of possession of explosives by an illegal alien, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said Friday. Kikumura, identified by the Japanese <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> as a suspected member of the terrorist <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> group, also was charged with one count each of having an illegal passport, a fraudulent visa and the passport of another person, <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> said. The charges together carry a prison term of up to 90 years. Police in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, said Thursday that <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> spent a few days in a city hotel in February prior to an April 14 car bombing allegedly staged by the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. The blast killed an American servicewoman and four Italians outside a USO club in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> experts haved traveled to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> to try to determine whether <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> was linked to those involved in the bombing. He was arrested April 12 at a service area on the turnpike in <LOCATION> Ridgefield </LOCATION> after a state trooper found the sophisticated homemade bombs and falsified papers, authorities said. Officials said <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> used a passport stolen from a Japanese hospital worker to obtain a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> entry visa from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> on Feb. 29. He entered the country on March 8, authorities said. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuby </PERSON>, who along with noted radical defense attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunstler </PERSON> is defending <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON>, said he found the number of charges incredible. `` You've taken a straightforward single offense, multiplied it, pyramided it until you face a century in jail,'' <PERSON> Kuby </PERSON> said, comparing it to a person arrested for distributing drugs and facing a separate count for each unit of the drug sold. `` He is being indicted for what the government thinks he is rather than what he has done,'' <PERSON> Kuby </PERSON> said. Kikumura is being held without bail in the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> without bail. <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> said he is to be arraigned next Friday in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lechner </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said following his first one-on-one debate with <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> the presidential campaign has begun `` a new phase'' in which differences between the two Democrats will be more clearly spelled out. Pressed by reporters about differences between the two remaining Democratic contenders, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said Friday nigt <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has not been forthcoming in detailing how he would translate his `` <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> miracle'' into solutions to aid the nation's economy As <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> takes much of the credit for his state's 2.9 percent unemployment rate, its plant-closings notice law and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s first universal health-insurance law. But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, speaking at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> four days before the state's primary, said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` so far has made out no budget.'' `` There must be some budget in order to establish priorities, in order to establish the plan,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` You simply can not afford a decent job for everybody at good wages, and you can not afford houses for everybody in this country unless you are going to make some judgments about shifting priorities,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` I'm willing to debate ways to pay for the dream.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he has called for a plan to freeze the military budget over the next five years, and that `` I have put forth a comprehensive plan to fight the war on drugs. The governor has not.'' Still, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he was wary of `` fracturing'' the party, and said he hoped there could be `` distinction without division.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> spoke to reporters after a good-natured, hour-long debate with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, their first such confrontation since Tennessee Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> dropped out of the race after the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary on Tuesday. Another debate was planned for tonight in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s support is shakier than in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has the support of the mayor and numerous other local elected officials. Later Friday night, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told a rocking congregation at the <ORGANIZATION> Calvin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presbyterian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in west <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> that the debate `` begins a new phase of the campaign'' in which a less crowded field will enable voters to become more familiar with individual candidates. He was flanked at the podium by his mother, <PERSON> Helen </PERSON>; Mayor <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Goode </PERSON>; Councilman <PERSON> Lucien </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackwell </PERSON>; State Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>; and actress <PERSON> Margot </PERSON> <PERSON> Kidder </PERSON>, a supporter who has joined <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> previously on the campaign trail. Earlier, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> addressed students at nearby <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, and announced a plan and a budget for a national child-care program with a $ 5.3 billion price tag. The plan calls for an increase in child-care assistance for families with low and moderate incomes and a strategy to use public schools for befo re-school and after-school programs.

<HEAD>Church Urges End To U.S. Sanctions, Saying Panama Has Suffered
Enough</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> is calling on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to lift economic sanctions imposed in an attempt to oust Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. It says <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> has suffered enough. `` We can not continue like this,'' the church hierarchy lamented in an eight-page pastoral letter made public Friday. The letter says the economic crisis brought on by the sanctions has meant `` misery and desperation'' for thousands of Panamanians and sparked an exodus `` that is beginning to have worrisome dimensions.'' The letter, signed by Archbishop <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> and the nation's 10 bishops, also expressed concern about rising crime and worry that the nation is being turned into `` a sinister battle camp.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s de facto leader and head of its 15,000-strong <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, was indicted in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on federal drug trafficking charges in February. The sanctions, imposed since, froze Panamanian assets in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and barred payments to the Noriega-controlled administration by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens and organizations. Combined with closures of the banks and a two-week strike in March, the measures have brought <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s economy to a virtual standstill. In its letter, the church says the sanctions have dealt a blow to all Panamanians, but especially to the poorest. It said the measures `` exceed any strategy of political pressure and constitute by themselves a threat to the life of our people. `` They are therefore morally unjust. Because of that, we demand that they be suspended immediately. In the same way, we reject all forms of military intervention.'' The church described as `` the gravest part of the situation'' the lack of dialogue between the government and <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s opponents It urged both sides to negotiate and end to the crisis and said it was willing to mediate the dispute. The church agreed at the end of March to mediate talks between the two sides, but suspended the effort a week later. Financial analysts, meanwhile, said the government was looking for an international organization to step in and help it process a backlog of checks accumulated during the bank shutdown. The government has been frustrated in its efforts to arrange a clearing-house operation with a private European or a Latin American bank. A financial analyst, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the government was turning to an international organization because it would be `` beyond the scope of -LRB- any in -RRB- the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' It was not clear which international organization would have the capability to act as a bank and process the thousands of accumulated checks. Banks closed the first week of March after customers began a run on some local institutions. The run was touched off when President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> was deposed Feb. 26 after he tried to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>.

 There had been reports <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> was demoted as the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION>'s No. 2 man for defiance in resisting Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s campaign for reform. But Friday, the two chatted amiably during a ceremony at the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s Palace of Congresses. The display of unity was witnessed by thousands inside the building and millions of television viewers. <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>'s fate and relationship with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> have been subjects of gossip and debate in official and intellectual circles since a newspaper published a letter to the editor a month ago defending dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, 67, is known to promote more restrained reform than <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s plan for a restructuring Soviet society, so there was speculation he was behind the letter in <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION>. It appeared in the name of a <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> teacher and was interpreted as a sign conservative opposition to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was gaining strength. Pravda later excoriated the pro-Stalin letter. The Communist Party daily made clear that the `` glasnost'' policy of more openness does not authorize opposition to `` perestroika,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s word for his reform program. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the newspaper exchange was seen as an allegory for the struggle between <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>. Some sources report that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> called a special meeting of the Politburo to reprimand <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> for opposing his reforms, and that his responsibility for ideology and party personnel were given to <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON>, a Politburo member who is a staunch <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> ally. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> held a news conference Friday night and told reporters there were no serious disagreements in the leadership. `` Sometimes we differ but this is only an indication of the fact that our society is undergoing a process of democratization,'' he said. `` There is no sign of any conflict situation.'' <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> Perfiliev </PERSON> was asked about the rumors earlier in the day and said `` there has been no change in the distribution of duties'' among party leaders. <PERSON> Perfiliev </PERSON> appeared unsure of <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>'s status, however, and said he thought the No. 2 man was on a `` short vacation.'' When the Politburo filed into the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> hall Friday to mark the 118th anniversary of <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>'s birth, <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> had the position accorded the chief ideologist and second-ranking leader: after <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> and Premier <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON>. Several shots on television showed <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in animated conversation while non-voting Politburo member <PERSON> Georgy </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Razumovsky </PERSON> spoke for nearly an hour about perestroika's merits. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and supporters of his reforms have acknowledged resistance at the highest levels but have not named their opponents. <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> was elevated to the Politburo after <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, now 57, became <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief in March 1985. His speeches have shown him to be more conservative than <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. He is reported to feel glasnost has gone too far in denouncing most economic and social policies of the past. <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> was made a full Politburo member in April 1985, at the first <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, without having served the customary term as a non-voting member.

 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration will ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to transfer administration of the federal family planning program from the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> to the states. Assistant <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Windom </PERSON> said Friday the shift would enable states `` to exercise maximum flexibility in tailoring services to more appropriately and effectively meet their citizens' family planning needs. In testimony to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on health, <PERSON> Windom </PERSON> said a federal ban on use of funds for abortion-related services and priority on serving low-income families would be retained. <PERSON> Windom </PERSON> said that by running their own programs, states could not only improve services but could also avoid `` burdensome application, reporting and monitoring requirements in the current program.''

<HEAD>Reagan, With Reservations, Signs Bill on Drug Mislabeling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed a bill designed to police mislabeled drugs, but said he will seek repeal of a provision requiring states to follow federal standards in licensing wholesale drug distributors. `` I support the expressed goal of this legislation, which is to reduce potential public health risks that may result from the distribution of mislabeled, subpotent, counterfeit or adulterated prescriptions drugs,'' the president said Friday. But he said the portion requiring federal standards to be adhered to in licensing drug wholesalers `` represents a substantial intrusion into traditional state responsibilities and prerogatives.'' He said he asked the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> to submit legislation to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> repealing that portion of the bill.

 The women's softball game between the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> lasted only an inning before the contest was suspended because of `` unsafe playing conditions.'' It was n't lightning or high wind that sent the players back to the locker room. Just a case of flying hammers. It seems some of the hammer throwers competing in the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> Relays adjacent to the softball diamond were a bit off target. Before play began Thursday, base umpires told the coaches that they would keep an eye out for errant hammers, said <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Coach <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Sortino </PERSON>. `` They told us to advise our outfielders that when they yelled ` heads up,' the outfielders were to start running towards home plate,'' she said Friday. However, when three 16-pound weights plunked into the outfield without a yip, and, between innings, a fourth `` landed right where a fielder would be standing,'' <PERSON> Sortino </PERSON> said she decided `` my players are n't going out there.'' `` The officials tried to persuade us to play an inning and then let the hammer throwers take some throws and then play another inning, but there were skads of them, it was freezing cold, already late, and it would have gone on forever,'' said <PERSON> Sortino </PERSON>, whose protest prompted the umpires to suspend the game. Some 25 men and 25 women hammer throwers, with three throws each, competed, said <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> <PERSON> Oslin </PERSON>, assistant athletic director at <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. `` We never had anything like this happen before,'' <PERSON> Oslin </PERSON> said. `` We host one major track meet a year and we will never again schedule a softball game at the same time.''

<HEAD>Former Archbishop Of Canterbury Lord Ramsey Dies At 83</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL WEST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Former Archbishop of <ORGANIZATION> Canterbury </ORGANIZATION> Lord <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON>, a kindly, craggy Christian and brilliant debater who traveled the world in his passion to unite its divided churches, died early today, the Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> said. He was 83. <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> was president of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION> from 1961 to 1968. The church press office said in a statement that he died at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION>, a residence for elderly people in <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>, after being ill for several weeks with bronchial pneumonia. His wife, <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON>, was at his side when he died peacefully at about 2 a.m. -LRB- 9 p.m. EDT Friday -RRB-. As Archbishop of <ORGANIZATION> Canterbury </ORGANIZATION> from 1961 to 1974, he was spiritual head of the Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and leader of the world's 70 million Anglicans, including the 3 million <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Episcopalians. <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> took a liberal stand on a wide variety of political and social issues of his day. He condemned the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bombing of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> during the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> War, called for <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to discard its nuclear weapons unilaterally and campaigned for relaxation of the laws restricting homosexuality, divorce and abortion. <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> demanded the abolition of the death penalty, was an outspoken opponent of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s apartheid policy of racial separation and opposed restrictions on the admission of <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> immigrants into <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. At his enthronement as Archbishop of <LOCATION> Canterbury </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> described his objectives as `` the unity of Christians.'' The Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> was at the time in process of a long decline, with dwindling church attendance and a diminishing role in the everyday lives of ordinary Britons. But <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> pushed the Church toward Christian reunion, which he predicted might come about before the end of this century, and made it aware of the world beyond <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. His passion to reunite the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> churches _ the Nonconformist, the Anglican, the Eastern Orthodox, and the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, divided over the centuries _ took him to more countries than any other Archbishop of Canterbury before him. <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> was bitterly disappointed when the General Synod of the Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> in 1972 rejected union with the Methodists. His air of craggy Christian kindness, as one newspaper described it, inspired trust and confidence among those who met him. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> was born on Nov. 14, 1904, the son of a lecturer in mathematics at <ORGANIZATION> Cambridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. His paternal grandfather was a Congregationalist minister and his maternal grandfather was an Anglican clergyman. He was educated at <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, ordained in 1928, and became Bishop of <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION> in 1952 and <LOCATION> Archbishop </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in 1956. <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> was made a life peer on his retirement as archbishop in 1974 and took the title of Lord <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Canterbury </LOCATION>. He was succeeded by <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Coggan </PERSON>, who retired from the post in 1980. The current Archbishop of <LOCATION> Canterbury </LOCATION> is <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON>. A funeral service for <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> will be held in historic <ORGANIZATION> Canterbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION> in southeast <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and a memorial service is also planned at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Westminster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abbey </ORGANIZATION>, the statement said. No dates have yet been set.

<TEXT>
 Increasing racial tensions on campus in recent years can be partly blamed on the `` self-centered'' ethics of students in the 1980s, educators and students were told at a conference. Not only have colleges failed to teach students about ethics, but the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has undermined gains in civil rights, contributing to a rise in racism, sexism and homophobia on campuses, some educators said. `` There's been a reversal in students from the 1960s,'' said <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, a psychologist and professor emeritus at the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, who has researched the effects of segregation on children. `` They are more self-centered and less socially conscious.'' The conference at <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> was attended Friday by more than 250 teachers, administrators and students from about 30 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> colleges. Sponsored by the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Higher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christians </ORGANIZATION> and Jews, its intent was to alert college leaders to the problems of intolerance and suggest possible solutions. But the educators said recent student protests over minority concerns at a number of colleges nationwide were encouraging. `` In part it's a good thing in the sense that it reflects a determination by minority kids not to take this treatment,'' said <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON>, professor of Education at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION>, where students occupied an administration building in February to protest campus racism. Those who attended the conference were treated to their own bit of protest when a group of student demonstrators took the stage even though the state's <ORGANIZATION> Chancellor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Higher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollander </PERSON>, refused them permission to speak. <PERSON> Hollander </PERSON> said later he was `` delighted'' to see them insist on speaking out. `` I've waited 10 years for students to show that kind of interest,'' he said. <PERSON> Hollander </PERSON> said organizers asked colleges to send students and officials to the conference `` who hold the power'' to make campuses aware of the state's effort to curb intolerance. The protesters spoke up after the keynote speech by Mayor <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>. They criticized the pace of reform and said conference organizers failed to invite student and community activists. `` We feel this is just a PR event to appease the community and falsely give the sense that the colleges are resolving racist relationships,'' said <PERSON> Salaam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ismail </PERSON>, coordinator of the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION>, which represents colleges statewide. The protesters had kind words for <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON>, mayor since 1981, who urged administrators to preach against intolerance and ensure that graduates are able to contribute to a diverse society. He said changing demographics, rising immigration from <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, competition from <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> countries and a stagnant economy require that Americans work together in a spirit of cooperation. <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON> said students should gain an `` education in reality'' by volunteering for community service and that universities should strive to develop minority leaders. Earlier Friday, in <LOCATION> Williamstown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, about 30 minority students took over a dean's office at <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. A spokesman for the protesters said that black, Hispanic, Asian and Polynesian students occupied <ORGANIZATION> Jenness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to protest what they say is the administration's unwillingness to address minority concerns at the prestigious liberal arts college. Also Friday, a group of minority students and <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> officials reached agreement to end the students' four-day occupation of the college president's office. The agreement calls for the university to increase the number of minority faculty members and students.

 A 10-year-old boy was stabbed to death and two other boys were wounded as they waited in a van outside a <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> TV station where their parents were participating in a child abuse program, police said. Authorities had no suspects in what may have been a robbery attempt Friday night, said <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> police Lt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Weems </PERSON>. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> was killed in the attack.

A <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> policeman who had been called to the studio to unlock a car arrived just after the stabbings, <PERSON> Snearly </PERSON> said. `` The officer actually caught the kid that died just as he was stumbling out of the van,'' Snearly said.

<HEAD>At Least 12 Die In Rebel Raid On Air Base</HEAD>

 Sinhalese rebels attacked the country's main air force base and battled troops for four hours before fleeing with stolen weapons. Officials said at least seven rebels and five servicemen were killed. Also Friday, guerrillas from the same group raided a radio station and stole communications equipment, authorities said. The military said the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> rebels ignited bombs `` as diversionary measures'' and stabbed two guards Friday night to enter <LOCATION> Katunayake </LOCATION> air base, 16 miles north of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. The officials, who under briefing rules spoke on condition of anonymity, said five rebels, 24 servicemen and four policemen were injured in the air base battle, during which flights were halted at the adjacent <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> international airport. At least three rebels were captured, but their comrades managed to escape with at least 30 Chinese made T-56 rifles and a machine gun, the officials said. It was the rebel group's second attack on the air base. On June 8, a similar attack was repulsed. The rebels also attacked a radio station of the government-owned Posts and <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunication </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said Telecommunication officer J.M. <PERSON> Peries </PERSON>. <PERSON> Peries </PERSON> said two employees were stabbed and were in critical condition today. He said the rebels stole radio equipment, but some of it was later recovered. The People's <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> began as a radical Marxist group, but now champions rights of the island's majority Sinhalese. It was outlawed after a failed 1971 attempt to overthrow the government, and regrouped in 1986. The front has opposed the July 29 peace accord between <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, which was aimed at ending the four-year separatist rebellion by the minority Tamils.

<HEAD>Judge Rules Minister Liable For Attack On His Wife</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A state district judge has ruled that <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> <PERSON> Railey </PERSON>, a former prominent Methodist minister, `` maliciously and brutally tried to strangle his wife'' in an attack that left her in a coma. Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Whittington </PERSON> issued the judgment Friday in a civil lawsuit filed by <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Railey </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Billie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicolai </PERSON>. <PERSON> Whittington </PERSON>, quoting from the lawsuit, also ruled <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> established a `` false alibi'' to cover his actions. The default judgment was announced a year and a day after Mrs. <PERSON> Railey </PERSON>, 39, was found lying unconscious on her garage floor. She has been comatose since the attack. Although he was served twice with the suit, <PERSON> Railey </PERSON>, 40, never responded in court to the allegation that he attacked his wife, though he has denied it out of court. `` If you bring allegations against the defendant and you give the defendant notice of the allegations and an opportunity to come in and respond to those allegations, and he refuses to do that, the court can hold the defendant liable and hold those allegations as true,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Nicolai </PERSON>'s attorney. <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> said a jury trial should determine this summer the damages <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> will be ordered to pay. <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> said he will seek actual damages for Mrs. <PERSON> Railey </PERSON>'s past and future medical bills and punitive damages for the pain and suffering of Mrs. <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> and her family. <PERSON> Railey </PERSON>, the former senior minister at <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, has said he was doing research on the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> campus the night his wife was attacked. After a suicide attempt following the attack, <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> refused to talk with police and refused to answer questions before a grand jury investigating the attack. <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> surrendered his ministerial credentials and moved to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, where he rented an apartment with <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> <PERSON> Papillon </PERSON>, a psychologist who told a grand jury she had been seeing <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> before the attack and that they had discussed marriage. The Raileys' two children are living with family friends in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. In his `` findings of fact,'' <PERSON> Whittington </PERSON> wrote `` that on or about April 21, 1987, the defendant <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> intentionally, knowingly, maliciously and brutally attempted to strangle his wife <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> to death. `` The Court further finds the defendant then left Mrs. <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> for dead, left his two young children _ <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, age 5, and <PERSON> Megan </PERSON>, age 2 _ alone in the house without supervision, and drove to the <ORGANIZATION> Fondren </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in an attempt to conceal his actions and to establish a false alibi for his wherabouts at the time of the assault,'' the judge wrote. `` My clients are very pleased,'' said <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON>, who plans to subpoena <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> for the trial and seek a warrant for his arrest. <PERSON> Railey </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulder </PERSON>, was not in his office or at home when phoned for comment and did return messages. The civil judgment has no bearing on a criminal investigation that officials say is stalled because of insufficient evidence. <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> has not been charged with any crime, but his attorney identified him as the chief suspect in the case. Investigators say they believe <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> is now in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area.

 A reporter and photographer for a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> newspaper were detained after they allegedly entered a 100-foot restricted area around a submarine shipyard where a Trident sub was scheduled to be launched today. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Romaner </PERSON>, photographer <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Badz </PERSON> and the skipper of their boat, <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Zelvin </PERSON>, were detained for more than two hours Friday. The Coast Guard accused <PERSON> Zelvin </PERSON>'s vessel of entering the restricted area around Electric Boat Shipyard. The newsmen had chartered <PERSON> Zelvin </PERSON>'s boat to take pictures of submarines at the yard for The <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Times-Union of <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>. Witnesses from the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boat </ORGANIZATION> reported the boat entered restricted waters, which extend 100 feet into the <LOCATION> Thames </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> from the shipyard, Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Rutkovsky </PERSON> said. `` We did n't know what we had. We did n't know if we had terrorists, criminals or what,'' he said. <PERSON> Rutkovsky </PERSON> said officials were concerned because the Trident submarine <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> was being prepared for launch today. Other submarines in various stages of construction also are at the shipyard. `` We were n't anywhere near 100 feet, we were n't even within 200 feet,'' <PERSON> Romaner </PERSON> said. A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> intelligence officer confiscated the photographer's film. <PERSON> Rutkovsky </PERSON> said if no sensitive portions of the shipyard are found on the film it will be returned to the newspaper. The newspaper's executive editor, <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartmann </PERSON>, tried to stop the confiscation in a telephone call to the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Romaner </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> is the 10th ship in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s Trident force. It will carry a crew of 154 and be armed with 24 Trident II missiles.

<HEAD>NASA Scientists Say Global Fires May Harm The Environment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAMPTON, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Fires set around the world to clear forests and agricultural fields may cause long-term damage to the environment, including depletion of the Earth's ozone layer, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> researchers say. Such `` biomass'' burning once was considered insignificant as a global hazard, said Dr. <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, a senior research scientist at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Langley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. Concern about ozone depletion has focused on products of industrialized nations, such as chlorofluorocarbons released from aerosol sprays, refrigeration equipment and in the manufacture of foam plastic containers. But <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> said Third World countries, where outdoor burning is common, also may be contributing heavily to ozone depletion and the creation of the so-called greenhouse effect, in which certain gases in the atmosphere are believed to be raising temperatures on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. `` The conclusion of this work is that on the global scale, the burning of forests and the burning of agricultural fields is a very, very significant source of the most environmentally significant gases,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> Richmond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Dispatch </ORGANIZATION>. These include nitrous oxide, nitric oxide, carbon dioxide, methane and carbon monoxide. This could have important implications for ozone depletion, since nitrogen oxides are believed responsible for about 70 percent of the ozone destroyed in the stratosphere, <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> said. By comparison, chlorofluorocarbons and other manmade chlorine gases account for less than 10 percent of the ozone destruction, he said. A <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> team headed by <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> and atmospheric scientist <PERSON> Wesley </PERSON> <PERSON> Cofer </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> is studying the extent and the content of fires to determine their possible effects on the environment. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> has estimated that 2-5 percent of the Earth's land surface is burned each year, a far greater mass than thought a decade or so ago. <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> said satellite photos obtained from the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> show that 5 percent may be a conservative estimate. The nighttime photos, taken during the early - and mid-1970s and recently declassified, reveal clusters of lights across sparsely populated territory, such as Central Africa These lights represent fires, <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> believes. By reviewing hundreds of such photos this summer, <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> said the team hopes to more closely determine the extent of burning. The researchers have studied individual fires in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and elsewhere to determine the composition of smoke and gauge the effect fires have on soil. Researchers found that emissions of nitrous oxide and nitric oxide from the soil increased tenfold after the fires. The soil emissions are released by microbes, tiny organisms that find a feast of nutrients in the ash from the fires, said microbiologist <PERSON> Penelope </PERSON> <PERSON> Boston </PERSON>. Ozone protects the Earth from the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays. Scientists say ultraviolet radiation reaching the Earth could increase 5 percent to 20 percent by the early 21st century. Potential hazards include increases in skin cancer rates and damage to eyes. Biomass burning may have a similar effect in producing greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> said. Greenhouse gases trap infrared heat in the Earth's atmosphere, leading to global warming that could melt ice at the North and South poles and lead to flooding of low-lying coastal areas.

<HEAD>PTL Says Tax-Exempt Status Revocation Won't Harm Donations At

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> television ministry says a decision by the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to revoke its tax-exempt status wo n't bring an immediate drop in donations to the financially troubled organization. However, <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> officials, who are trying to reorganize the ministry in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> here, have said the tax-exempt status is essential to <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s survival because it depends on tax-deductible contributions to operate. The announcement Friday by the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> follows a federal appeals court ruling Wednesday dissolving a preliminary injunction that had prevented the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> from revoking the tax-exempt status. `` We felt the organization has not operated within the guidelines ... in its original charter,'' said <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Witmer </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> regional office. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s court-appointed trustee, was not immediately available for comment, <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivey </PERSON> said. But Ms. <PERSON> Ivey </PERSON> said the ministry did not expect any immediate impact on donations. `` The bulk of our support comes from people who are able to give no more than $ 15 and $ 20 a month, and they're not losing a tax deduction, at least not right away,'' she said. <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> already has applied for a new tax-exempt charter, and hopes to be without the status of a non-profit corporation only `` for a brief time,'' Assistant U.S. Trustee <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Buzhardt </PERSON>, whose office is administering the reorganization, said after the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> ruling Friday. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> claims <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> owes more than $ 55 million in taxes from June 1983 to June 1987, the month <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> filed for protection from creditors because of $ 72 million in debt, not counting the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> claim. The revocation is based on the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>' examination of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s records in bankruptcy court, <PERSON> Witmer </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> had `` excessive unrelated business income or income which was not really in keeping with the tax-exempt purpose,'' he said. An <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> report in December concluded that <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> founders <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and their aides profited excessively from donations to the ministry. In addition, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> held that much of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> theme park operations in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mill </LOCATION> were commercial rather than ministerial. The <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> received $ 10.7 million in their last seven years with the ministry, $ 9.4 million of which was excessive and unreasonable, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> report said. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> resigned March 19, 1987, when a story was about to break that he had had sex with former church secretary <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> in 1980 and that the ministry had paid her $ 265,000 in hush money. A call to the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION>' home in <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, was answered by a recording; a request for comment was not returned. An <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> statement said the agency `` can no longer assure taxpayers of the deductibility of contributions to <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>.'' However, it said past contributions are fully deductible. On Wednesday, the 4th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, affirmed a lower court ruling that the bankruptcy court did not have the authority to issue a preliminary injunction preventing the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> from revoking the ministry's tax-exempt status. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said the ministry may appeal. If so, contributions by individuals would still be deductible up to $ 1,000 until the appeal is decided, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> said. The government appealed the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> reorganization plan approved Dec. 29 by the bankruptcy court in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> and still opposes it. The plan, which anticipated <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> would remain tax exempt, divides the ministry into non-profit and for-profit corporations.

 A woman charged with second-degree murder for drowning her colicky 2-month-old son had run up about $ 20,000 in medical bills to correct an infertility problem before she conceived the child, her attorney says. <PERSON> Lucrezia </PERSON> <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON> was having trouble becoming pregnant and went to a doctor who gave her a federally unapproved fertility drug, said the attorney, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> DePaola </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON>, 36, later had an operation to correct the problem and became pregnant last year, he said Friday. He said her medical bills exceeded $ 20,000. `` She conceived, but it was a difficult pregnancy and a difficult delivery, by Caesarean section,'' he said. Child abuse experts see Mrs. <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON> as a victim, too _ a prisoner of post-birth depression who received no help in handling her problems. `` What's mind-boggling to me is the friends, family and neighbors of this woman did n't see what was happening to this mother,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fontana </PERSON>, chairman of Mayor's <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> on Child Abuse and Neglect. `` Postpartum depression is a disease,'' he continued. `` It can make a loving, caring mother feel like killing herself and her baby.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON>, 36, was ordered held on $ 75,000 bail Friday at a <ORGANIZATION> Brooklyn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> hearing in the death two days earlier of her infant son, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON> called police Wednesday to report <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> had been kidnapped; a day later, she broke down during an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> polygraph test, told detectives about her son's death and gave them the location of his body. Mrs. <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON>, a homemaker, was alone when the baby died. Her 7-year-old son, <PERSON> John </PERSON>, was at school; her husband, <PERSON> John </PERSON>, was at work. <PERSON> DePaola </PERSON> refused to comment on his defense strategy after the bail hearing, where Mrs. <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON> was also barred from unsupervised visits with her 7-year-old son. In a similar case three months ago, a <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> woman was acquitted by reason of insanity after her lawyers argued she suffered from severe postpartum depression. <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Remington </PERSON>, 29, shot her 6-week-old son with a .22 caliber handgun before trying to kill herself. <PERSON> DePaola </PERSON> said his client `` had been on an emotional roller coaster'' since 1984. Among her problems were an accidental sterilization by a doctor, a subsequent operation to correct that condition and the difficult birth, he said. Postpartum depression can cause crying spells in new mothers; other symptoms include irritability, exhaustion, insomnia and confusion about child care. <PERSON> Fontana </PERSON> estimated it strikes 70 percent of mothers in one form or another.

<TEXT>
 A chartered Swiss executive jet carrying negotiators seeking the release of three French hostages took off from <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> airport today without any of the missing men, airport officials said. The plane's arrival in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, two hours earlier fueled speculation it had come for the Frenchmen and their release was imminent. The three have been held by Shiite Moslem extremists since 1985. The airport officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they did not know the destination of the 12-seat Falcon 50 jet. But radio monitors in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> heard the pilot tell <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION> tower he was heading for <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. A senior <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> airport official said there were four French negotiatiors aboard the Falcon 50 when it left <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> today. He said the four flew into <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> Friday on the same jet, which spent Friday night in <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION>. `` None of the hostages was with them'' when they left <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, the official said. The plane left <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> today after radio reports said negotiations to free the hostages had hit a snag, apparently after the kidnappers made last-minute demands. Asked whether the latest effort to release the Frenchmen had collapsed, the airport official said: `` I do n't know. I ca n't tell. A source close to the command of a 7,500-man Syrian army force in charge of security in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> had said Friday night that the French hostages would be released in `` a matter of hours.'' He spoke on condition of anonymity. The three Frenchmen are diplomats <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Carton </PERSON> and journalist <PERSON> Jean-Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON> and Carton were kidnapped separately March 22, 1985, <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON> two months later. A fourth Frenchman, researcher <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Seurat </PERSON>, was kidnapped May 22, 1985. The extremist group Islamic Jihad, or Holy War, claimed 10 months later that it had killed him. Although no body has been found, <PERSON> Seurat </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Marie </PERSON>, said in a book she published last month that French officials have told her he died in captivity. Two other French hostages, photo-journalist <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Auque </PERSON> and television lighting engineer <PERSON> Jean-Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Normandin </PERSON>, were released Nov. 27 by Shiite kidnappers Nov. 27. The French government of Prime Minister <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> has been trying to free the three men before the first round of the French presidential elections Sunday. In addition to the French captives, 18 other foreigners are missing in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Three elementary school students who were following their father's profession of street preaching were suspended for disruptive behavior after they allegedly shouted at other students and called teachers `` whoremongers.'' <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> <PERSON> Strode </PERSON>, 10, was suspended for five days, while Pepper Strode, 7, and <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Strode </PERSON>, 5, were suspended for three days. `` I have pled with this man,'' school Superintendent <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricketts </PERSON> said of the children's father, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Strode </PERSON>. `` We've given them every opportunity to comply with the rules. This is the fourth or fifth violation. `` I know it looks crazy to suspend the kindergartner, but the preaching is not the issue,'' <PERSON> Ricketts </PERSON> said. Strode said the children are not disruptive, that they are `` just preaching Scripture.'' <ORGANIZATION> Eastfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> principal <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorst </PERSON> said the words may be scriptural, but refererences to his teachers as whoremongers had created some stress. The Scripture the children are using is Hebrews 13:4, which says, `` Marriage is honorable in all, and the bed undefiled, but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.'' The students, who were suspended Thursday, returned to their preaching just outside the school gates twice Friday. But the appearance of an officer from the <ORGANIZATION> McDowell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> _ requested by <PERSON> Gorst </PERSON> _ ended the preaching <PERSON> Gorst </PERSON> said it was the first time in his seven years as principal he had suspended a kindergartner. <PERSON> Gorst </PERSON> said the two boys and their sister were suspended for disruptive behavior and refusing to come into the school building between 7:30 a.m. and 8 a.m. Thursday. The children, he said, were `` screaming. They were just screaming at people.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroke </PERSON> said he had contacted an attorney. `` They may be within their rights,'' <PERSON> Strode </PERSON> said of school officials' suspension of the chidren. `` If they are, we'll just have to take it.'' School board attorney <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> <PERSON> Dameron </PERSON>, who had witnessed earlier preaching by the children, said he found it disruptive. `` The children who are being yelled at were clearly disturbed,'' <PERSON> Dameron </PERSON> said. `` Eastfield has a policy against disruptive behavior, and if children are being upset, we have to treat it as disruptive behavior.''

<TEXT>
 A wintry storm system spawned thunderstorms that swept across much of the nation today, dumping rain, snow and hail along the way. The storm system tracked into central Illinois late Friday, setting off thunderstorms early this morning from <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> through northern <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, into southern <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and northwest <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. The storms were moving into western parts of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and brought hail, gusty winds and brief heavy rain. <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> received the brunt of the storm activity Friday night.

 <PERSON> Mick </PERSON> <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> half-sang, half-spoke some of the <ORGANIZATION> Rolling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stones </ORGANIZATION>' greatest hits from the witness stand as he tried to prove he did n't steal a song from a reggae musician. <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> swayed to the beat and came close to singing Friday as he recited for a judge, jury and fans who packed the courtroom, `` Jumpin' <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Flash </PERSON>, it's a gas, gas, gas.'' <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> was trying to show how he uses repetition in his lyrics, as part of his defense against a charge by <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Alley </PERSON>, who is suing for copyright infringement, claiming <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON>'s 1985 solo hit `` Just Another Night'' was copied from his 1979 song of the same name. The choruses in both songs use the phrase `` Just another night'' repeatedly. <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> has denied he stole the song, which he said he did n't hear until the suit was filed in 1986 He has testified for two days, playing tapes of the song as it was written and arranged in 1983 and 1984 to try to show the independent development of the piece. In Friday's session, he quoted lyrics from `` <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> <PERSON> Sugar </PERSON>,'' `` Miss You,'' and `` Let's Spend the Night Together.'' <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> testified that repetition is common in popular music. Tapes were played of at least six different versions of the tune, recorded in various places with various people in 1984. The version that was released was recorded in May 1984 in <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, with a drummer named <PERSON> Sly </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunbar </PERSON>. Alley claims <PERSON> Dunbar </PERSON> played for his recording in 1979. <PERSON> Dunbar </PERSON> has testified that he did n't remember whether he played for Alley or not. <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> testified that the title and lyrics to the song went through a metamorphosis, starting with `` Another Night,'' and `` just another something else'' while he was `` messing around'' to develop the music. He could n't remember when he finished the lyrics or title. <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> admitting playing reggae music with the late reggae musician <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Tosh </PERSON>, but said he did n't tend to listen to radio stations that played that kind of music. He said he acknowledged works of other artists and paid them royalties. <PERSON> Alley </PERSON>'s lawyers have said <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON>'s version netted as much as $ 6 million. The chorus of <LOCATION> Alley </LOCATION>'s song goes, `` Can I spend another, just another night, just another night, just another night with you.'' <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON>'s lines are, `` Give me just another night, just another night with you. Give me just another kiss, just before the dawn breaks through.'' After his testimony, expected to continue Monday, <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> signed autographs and told reporters he thought the case was going well.

 President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of concealing arms in shipments of non-lethal aid to rebels and said the White House is encouraging the military hardliners in the <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> leadership. At a news conference Friday, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> also urged the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to resume negotiations on `` national security'' matters of mutual concern, suggesting the first meeting be held May 15 in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The Nicaraguan leader said he was taking up President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on a promise of talks <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> made in November when he told the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> that Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> was prepared to meet with Nicaraguan officials `` once serious negotiations'' on a Nicaraguan cease-fire were under way. `` We have met with the Contras, there is a cease-fire, there is an agreement and the time has come for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government to show consistency by meeting with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to discuss matters of national security,'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said. He suggested the meetings begin May 15 at the Mexican west coast resort of <LOCATION> Manzanillo </LOCATION>, where the two nations held talks that ended unsucessfully in January 1985. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government's ambassador to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Tunnerman </PERSON>, would deliver a formal proposal in a few days. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of encouraging military hardliners in the <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> leadership by deciding to give the rebels non-lethal aid in violation of the preliminary peace accord his government signed with the Contras March 23. He also claimed the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was concealing weapons and ammunition in shipments of humanitarian aid to rebels in Honduran camps. The preliminary accord allows humanitarian aid to be distributed through neutral international organizations, but only after the rebels have settled in seven cease-fire zones inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> during the first half of May. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said that non-lethal aid, most of it food, was already being flown from <LOCATION> Toncontin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>, the Honduran capital, to camps controlled by Contra commanders who oppose the cease-fire. An official of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, which is handling the shipments, said Thursday that the first truckloads of food arrived at rebel camps inside <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> this week. He said they were sent from <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION> after being inspected by independent observers to make sure they did not contain arms. The March 23 preliminary peace accord signed in the southern border town of <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION> established a 60-day cease-fire than began April 1 and during which both sides are charged with seeking to negotiate a lasting peace in the 6 -LCB- - year-old conflict that has cost more than 26,000 lives

<HEAD>Attorney General Opens Formal Investigation Of Mecham Remarks On
Jury</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s attorney general has launched a formal investigation into whether former Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> broke the law when he urged supporters to `` have a lapse of memory'' about their support for him if they become potential jurors at his criminal trial. Attorney General <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> said Friday he decided to launch the probe after first looking into whether <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s statements, `` assuming they are true,'' could be a violation of criminal statutes. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> acknowledged Thursday he made the remark Monday during an invitation-only Republican meeting, but said he was only joking. Told Friday that <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> had decided on a formal investigation, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> said `` I have no objection to his investigating anything he wants'' and declined further comment. <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> said the investigation will be to determine whether <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> violated one of several laws, including the solicitation law, which prohibits asking somebody to commit or help commit a crime. <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> said he did not think the investigation would result in a delay of <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s May 19 trial on six felony charges of fraud, perjury and filing false documents for failing to report a $ 350,000 loan to his 1986 campaign. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s brother and 1986 campaign treasurer, <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, faces three similar counts. On Thursday, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview, `` Somebody asked if we could get a fair trial. I said -LRB- no -RRB- unless we could get some people who were friendly that might have a lapse of memory'' when they were questioned about whether they could be impartial. `` I said it tongue-in-cheek. In fact, everybody laughed about it,'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> said. `` I'm not going to quit talking ... just because we've got a bunch of people without a sense of humor.'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was removed from office April 4 upon his conviction by the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on impeachment charges that he attempted to thwart an investigation of an alleged death threat and that he misused a protocol fund by loaning $ 80,000 from it to his car dealership.

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> kept a tight curfew on at least 400,000 Arabs in the occupied territories today, which leaders of the Palestinian uprising have designated a `` Day of Rage'' to protest the assassination of a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader. Violence broke out Friday during protests over <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> military chief <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>'s slaying, and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers killed two Arabs and wounded at least 36 in the occupied territories. In <LOCATION> Jersualem </LOCATION>, police battled rioting Moslem worshipers on the sacred <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION>. The curfew, imposed on Monday, covered the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> towns of <LOCATION> Anabta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> _ the area's largest town with more than 100,000 population _ and 20 Palestinian refugee camps in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. A total of 400,000 people were under curfew, according to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. Arab ringleaders threatened to take revenge on merchants who defied <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> orders to strike and called on Arabs to turn the Moslem holy month of <LOCATION> Ramadan </LOCATION> into `` a month of fury.'' <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>, better known by his nom de guerre <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jihad </PERSON>, was killed one week ago at his <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> home by commandos said to be Israeli. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Idna </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, soldiers killed a 28-year-old Arab Friday who tried to attack a border policeman with a nail-studded club, the army said. Military officials said troops had entered <LOCATION> Idna </LOCATION> to search the village. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> town of <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON>, 25-year-old <PERSON> Fayez </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> died of a bullet wound to the head Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Nasser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> officials said. The army said he was shot when troops fired on a car trying to run over them. The fatalities brought to 171 the number of Palestinians killed since unrest began Dec. 8 in territories <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier and a Jewish girl settler have also been killed. The Temple Mount riot followed prayers on the first Friday of <PERSON> Ramadan </PERSON> attended by about 10,000 worshipers at the <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Aqsa </PERSON> mosque and the Dome of the Rock, where Moslems believe the prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> ascended to heaven. Police fired rubber bullets and swung truncheons to disperse hundreds of stone-throwing demonstrators. The Arabs carried outlawed <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags and black banners and chanted, `` With our spirit and our blood, we will avenge Abu Jihad!'' Rubber bullets and beatings injured six Arabs and stones wounded five policemen at the site, which is also sacred to Jews who say the Second Temple stood there until Romans destroyed it in 70 A.D.. More than 30 protesters were arrested, police said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> TV showed two protesters being carried out on stretchers. Leaftets bearing <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>'s picture and calling for more protests today were distributed at <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> mosques. Underground leaders ordered Arabs to step up attacks with `` stones, gasoline bombs, metal balls and slingshots.'' Also Friday, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> warplanes blasted <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrilla bases in seaside hills south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in the sixth such raid into <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this year. Police said at least one fighter was killed and eight wounded. After noon Moslem prayers, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers clashed with protesters at several sites in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. At <LOCATION> Jabaliya </LOCATION> refugee camp, 12 Arabs were wounded when soldiers fired on protesters, and 18 others were hurt by rubber bullets and beatings, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> and hospital officials said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said 12 people were hurt. The army said soldiers used live ammunition after Jabaliya residents defied a curfew and tear gas and rubber bullets failed to disperse the crowd. Outside <LOCATION> Omari </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mosque </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops hurled tear gas canisters and fired in the air when about 200 <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> youths left prayers to throw rocks and chant, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> witnesses said. In <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> and neighboring <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bireh </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops patrolled the streets in trucks and jeeps. On the walls were freshly painted slogans calling for avenging the death of <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>. Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Shaike </PERSON> <PERSON> Erez </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s military administration, said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> TV that the curfews in the occupied lands would `` continue until we become convinced that the area will return to normal life.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, Soviet Ambassador <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Belonogov </PERSON> on Friday accused <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> of state terrorism in <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>'s death. He told the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, `` It is but another example of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s cynical contempt for world public opinion.''

<HEAD>Guerrillas Claim Capture Of Strategic Soviet-Afghan Garrison</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Moslem guerrillas claimed today that they captured a strategic Soviet-Afghan garrison after a four-month siege. The <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION> headquarters of the seven-party <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> alliance said <PERSON> Barikot </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s northeast <LOCATION> Kunar </LOCATION> province, fell Friday. The alliance said the capture will boost their supply flow over the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Spokesmen said the base and village were heavily fortified and served as the headquarters of Communist <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s 55th army brigade. The rebels, led by Commander <PERSON> Rahmatullah </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Hezb-i-Islami </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Khalis </LOCATION> faction reported that helicopters airlifted five infantry and commando battalions before the insurgents overran the compound around 1 p.m. Soviet and Afghan aircraft indiscriminately bombed and shelled the <LOCATION> Barikot </LOCATION> area during the first stage of the attack, destroying dozens of houses, guerrillas said. The rebels said 17 of their fighters died and 16 were wounded but they had no casualty figures for Soviet-Afghan troops. Barikot lies just inside the Afghan border with northern <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. There was no immediate confirmation of the report but if accurate, it would be a major victory for the anti-communist guerrillas and would open a new direct supply route from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> weapons. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is a staging area for the <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> resistance although <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> has pledged in an April 14 Soviet troop withdrawal accord to stop serving as an arms conduit when the agreement goes into effect on May 15. Under the agreement, the Soviets agreed to withdraw its estimated 115,000 troops over a nine-month period, beginning May 15. The Soviets intervened in December 1979.

<TEXT>
 Eritrean rebels shelled <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s biggest port and the country's only oil refinery, killing five people and wounding 15, the <ORGANIZATION> Ethiopian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said in an unprecedented report on the civil war Western diplomats said they believed the refinery was not damaged, but were unsure about the port of <LOCATION> Assab </LOCATION>, which controls more than 75 percent of this East African nation's imports and exports, including emergency food relief for 7 million drought victims. `` It sounds like the attack was nipped in the bud,'' said one diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. Diplomats said it was believed to be the first rebel attack on the port. The state-run news agency reported Friday that the <LOCATION> Ethiopian </LOCATION> navy blew up the boat from which rebels launched a night attack Tuesday from the hilly island of Senabor, off <LOCATION> Assab </LOCATION>, 530 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>, the capital. <LOCATION> Assab </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Massawa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s only other major port, are in the <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> province. The agency said the boat capsized with an unspecified number of rebels on board. It gave no further details of the attackers' fate. The agency also did not say if the refinery or port were damaged. Nor did it indicate what type of weapons were used by the <ORGANIZATION> Eritrean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> rebels. `` The refinery is a source of vital fuel for surface, air and marine transport and for industrial development in general,'' the agency said. `` The attempt of the bandits to destroy the refinery clearly demonstrates their reckless aim of engaging in suicidal missions.'' The news agency also disclosed, in the first official report of the attack, that rebels of the <ORGANIZATION> Tigrean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> recently destroyed a microwave relay station connecting the Eritrean capital, <LOCATION> Asmara </LOCATION>, to the rest of the country. The report of the <LOCATION> Assab </LOCATION> attack is the first of its kind since President <PERSON> Mengistu </PERSON> <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariam </PERSON> ended years of official silence March 30 about the two insurgencies in the northernmost neighboring provinces of <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tigre </LOCATION>. In his first admission that his government is at war, <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION> announced an offensive against the rebels, who have captured several towns in major victories this year. There has been no official comment on an Eritrean rebel claim that its guerrillas on Friday shot down a MiG-21 fighter jet and captured the pilot. Voice of the Broad Masses of <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION>, the clandestine rebel radio, said the plane was downed during fighting northeast of <LOCATION> Asmara </LOCATION>, in which it claimed 100 government soldiers were killed and 216 wounded in a battle Thursday. There were no foreign relief workers in <LOCATION> Assab </LOCATION> this week because the government last week expelled about 60 Western relief workers from <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Tigre </PERSON>, citing `` personnel risks'' in the war-torn area. The expulsions have jeopardized a massive Western-funded emergency relief operation to help an estimated 3.2 million people threatened with starvation in <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Tigre </PERSON>, the provinces worst hit by drought. This week, the government allowed four <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> workers into <LOCATION> Asmara </LOCATION> to supervise relief food distribution. Western diplomats and relief officials have criticized the expulsions and say they fear the government wants to remove foreign witnesses from the region as it prepares for all-out war. They have accused the government and rebels, all of whom are Marxist, of jeopardizing the lives of drought victims in pursuit of military victory. Secessionist Eritrean rebels have been fighting for 27 years in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s oldest civil war. Rebels in <LOCATION> Tigre </LOCATION> took up arms 14 years ago demanding a bigger say in the governing of their province.

 A pregnant woman shopping in a video store with her three children was shot to death by a robber, authorities said, but doctors were able to save her nearly full-term fetus by a Ceasarean section delivery. The robber shot <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, 31, of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> as he was leaving the video store Friday night, apparently because he was unhappy with the amount of cash he had gotten, said <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's Lt. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>. The gunman entered the Voyager Video store at 8:40 p.m., milled around for a few minutes, then turned to the clerk and demanded cash, <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said. The clerk complied, he said, but the robber grumbled about wanting more money. He turned to leave, but as he left he pulled out a small caliber, silver-colored handgun, put it to <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>' head and pulled the trigger. Witnesses told <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> the man then said, `` That'll take care of her.'' The amount of cash taken was undetermined. In addition to the children whose ages ranged from 5 to 13 years old, and the clerk, about eight other people witnessed the shooting. All said it was unprovoked, <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> was taken to <LOCATION> Pioneer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> and later transported by helicopter to the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, where she was pronounced dead, said nursing supervisor <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>. Her daughter was delivered by Caesarean section and was in critical condition, <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said. The baby was about 32-34 weeks along, which is almost full-term, but was suffering from lack of oxygen. Witnesses described the gunman as in his 30s or 40s, about 6 feet tall with graying hair and wearing a plaid shirt and blue jeans. Police searching for the man were preparing a composite drawing from witness descriptions, deputies

 Photographic evidence of <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s sins will be presented in court now that evangelist <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON>'s $ 90 million lawsuit against <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> has been revived, <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON>'s `` This case is about an attack made on Rev. <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON>. I think you have to look at the credibility of the attacker to determine the credibility of the attack,'' said <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> <PERSON> Lundy </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> 4th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> on Friday ordered a lower court to hear <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON>'s case against <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, rejecting arguments that it was purely a church matter that did n't belong in the courts. The court said church doctrine requiring that charges against <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON> be published within the Assemblies of God denomination did not protect members who spread the accusations outside the church. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Whittman </PERSON>, said he would appeal to the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON>'s lawsuit, filed over a year ago, claims <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> falsely accused him of adulterous affairs in an effort to bring down <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON>'s television ministry. <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON> resigned from the Assemblies of God following the scandal. He admitted to a single adulterous encounter in 1979, but said <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s other accusations of adultery were lies. Various sources have reported that earlier this year, <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON> sent Assemblies of God leaders photographs of <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> outside a suburban <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> motel with a prostitute. A woman who later claimed to be that prostitute said <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> paid her to pose in the nude. <PERSON> Lundy </PERSON>, while not saying what the photographs show, said he will definitely use them along with other evidence gathered by private detectives. `` It now appears that we will get our day in court and all the facts will be presented to a jury of our peers, and I know we will be exonerated from the lies published about me, my family and my ministry,'' <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON> said. On Feb. 21, <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> confessed before his <ORGANIZATION> Baton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> congregation to an unspecified sins and stepped down from the pulpit. He said he would submit to the church's decree. But he left the Pentecostal denomination after the Executive and General presbyteries ordered a one-year suspension from the pulpit rather than the three-month one recommended by the <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. He said he was not rebelling, but his ministry and <PERSON> Bible </PERSON> college could not afford for him to be out of the pulpit that long. <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON> said he had confronted <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> with his evidence in October and given him four months to make himself clean with the church before presenting the evidence against him.

 <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` General Hospital'' took time out for a black-tie gala to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the super soap opera and highest-rated daytime serial. <PERSON> Emily </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON>, one of two original cast members still with the show, recalled the serial's humble beginnings, during the bash Friday at the Ambassador Hotel's legendary Cocoanut Grove. `` When we started, I did n't think we were going to last 25 minutes let alone 25 years. It was very iffy,'' she said. `` We hit No. 1 in 1968, and then we went down so far we were almost canceled.''

 A fragile pedal-plane skimmed across a 74-mile stretch of the <LOCATION> Aegean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Crete </LOCATION> to this Greek island today to break the world record for human-powered flight, despite a crash-landing. The pink-and-silver <ORGANIZATION> Daedalus </ORGANIZATION> 88, piloted by Greek national cycling champion <PERSON> Kanellos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanellopoulos </PERSON>, dropped into the surf just off the black sands of <LOCATION> Perissa </LOCATION> beach, on the southeast face of this volcanic island, also known as Thira. `` I was expecting the takeoff to be horrible but it went off great, especially with the tailwind. The most turbulent area was here at the end,'' said <PERSON> Kanellopoulos </PERSON>, still wet after his landing. A strong headwind about 30 feet from the beach forced the 72-pound plane to crash-land. `` He tried to pull up on the joystick to elevate the plane to turn parallel to the beach to deal with headwind and then a gust hit the hovering plane,'' said <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Tremml </PERSON>, the former world record holder. Tremml, who witnessed the landing said the sudden movement `` broke the tail boom and then the wings folded and he gently floated down. He dove out and swam to the beach with a huge smile on his face.'' <PERSON> Kanellopoulos </PERSON>, 30, was not injured, said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Massasschusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, which sponsored the project. Greek navy and coast guard vessels along with inflatable rescue craft had escorted the plane as it cruised 15 feet above the <LOCATION> Aegean </LOCATION>. The 36-member MIT team had waited three weeks on windy <LOCATION> Crete </LOCATION> for a suitable day to attempt the flight. <ORGANIZATION> Daedalus </ORGANIZATION> flew the distance from <LOCATION> Crete </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heraklion </LOCATION> military airfield in 3 hours, 54 minutes, faster than anticipated, and landed at 11 a.m. -LRB- 4 a.m. EDT -RRB-. Project organizers had estimated a flight time of at least five hours at a speed of around 14 miles an hour. Officials at <LOCATION> Heraklion </LOCATION> airport attributed the quicker flight to a 3 - to 4-knot tailwind <ORGANIZATION> Daedalus </ORGANIZATION> 88 broke two records. First it shattered the mark for straight-line human-powered flight set in 1979, when <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> pedaled the Gossamer Albatross 22.5 miles across the English Channel. Then it broke the world record for human-powered flight, set by a <ORGANIZATION> Daedalus </ORGANIZATION> 88 prototype, <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eagle </ORGANIZATION>, which flew 37.2 miles around <LOCATION> Edwards </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in January 1987. <PERSON> Kanellopoulos </PERSON> smiled at reporters as he waited for the all-clear to take off in <LOCATION> Crete </LOCATION>. `` The flight belongs to <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. We together are going to realize and keep the myth. And of course this is the best way to visit <LOCATION> Santorini </LOCATION>,'' he said as he was being sealed into the ultra-light plane. Essential requirements for the flight were a calm sea, southerly winds of less than 3 knots, temperatures under 70 degrees and visibility to the horizon, according to <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bussolari </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION> aeronautics professor in charge of flight operations. The flight also was intended to emulate the 3,500-year-old myth of <ORGANIZATION> Daedalus </ORGANIZATION>, said to have flapped his way across the <LOCATION> Aegean </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Crete </LOCATION> on wings of feathers and wax. <PERSON> Daedalus </PERSON> landed safely but his son <PERSON> Icarus </PERSON> flew too close to the sun. The wax of his wings melted and he plummeted to the sea and drowned. Had the plane not made it, two similar backup planes would have been assembled for another record flight attempt before mid-May, when the weather turns too hot for human-powered flying. Three other athlete-pilots had been taking turns standing by for 48 hours each in readiness for a possible record flight. They are <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Scioscia </PERSON>, 27, of <LOCATION> Scranton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Zack </PERSON>, 26, of <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Tremml </PERSON>, a 27-year-old <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION> medical student.

<HEAD>28 Crew Members Still Missing as Greek Tanker Burns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. JOHN'S, Newfoundland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Authorities scaled down an air and sea search today as hope dwindled for finding any survivors among the 29 people who were aboard a Greek tanker that broke up in a fire. Seven merchant ships helping to scour the area about 370 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Race </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION>, were told today they could abandon the search, said Petty Officer <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Terrill </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Early today, the stern of the 18,000-ton tanker was still ablaze. The bow sank Friday in rain squalls and winds exceeding 55 mph that whipped up 5-foot swells. On Friday night, searchers recovered the badly burned body of a crewman, <PERSON> Andrej </PERSON> <PERSON> Szukalski </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. The other 28 people aboard _ 23 Polish sailors and five of their wives _ remained missing. The 500-foot Athenian Venture, which was carrying gasoline from <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, apparently exploded and caught fire early Friday. The Cypriot-registered tanker was owned by <ORGANIZATION> Patron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>. The recovered body, which was wearing a lifejacket, carried the ship's logs. The logs gave no indication of what had happened on the vessel. Rough seas and rain squalls hampered searchers Friday, but the weather cleared overnight. Skies were overcast today, but winds were calm, <PERSON> Terrill </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Terrill </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION>, the Canadian research vessel that first spotted the burning tanker, will continue searching for possible survivors today. A Canadian Forces patrol plane was scanning the seas and would be rejoined by two <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> C130 Hercules from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> later today. Vessels using the shipping lane were being asked to be on the lookout for the remaining 28 missing crewmembers.

 An agreement short of adoption has been struck in the case of a Navajo baby that will lead to permanent guardianship by a non-Indian <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, couple and visitation rights by the mother. In the end, all parties agreed, it was <PERSON> Baby </PERSON> <PERSON> Allyssa </PERSON> who won. The agreement struck Friday among Navajo officials, <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Keetso </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitts </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, granted the couple temporary custody of the 9-month-old Navajo daughter of Ms. <PERSON> Keetso </PERSON> pending tribal court proceedings to give them permanent guardianship. Under it, Ms. <PERSON> Keetso </PERSON> will retain her parental and visitation rights, and the tribe's concern that <PERSON> Allyssa </PERSON> be given an identification with her <LOCATION> Navajo </LOCATION> heritage and culture will be assured, said <PERSON> Anslem </PERSON> <PERSON> Roanhorse </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Navajo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION>. Tribal authorities also gave it their approval, after 4 -LCB- hours of negotiations involving <ORGANIZATION> Navajo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION>'s Judge <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Watchman </PERSON>, lawyers, a legal advocate for the child, tribal social welfare officials and others. `` I feel wonderful,'' <PERSON> Pitts </PERSON> told reporters, saying the effort that had begun as an adoption proceeding in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> `` definitely'' was worth going through. `` The anguish and pain and confusion felt, I'm sure, by the Pittses, the natural mother, the family members have hopefully come to an end,'' said <PERSON> Roanhorse </PERSON>. `` Perhaps now the healing process can begin.'' <PERSON> Roanhorse </PERSON> said the case set a precedent in upholding the rights of extended family members. <PERSON> Pitts </PERSON> expressed satisfaction with the compromise, which he said `` was nothing more than our original intentions.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Pitts </PERSON> said, `` I think things could have been done in a different way if somebody had just listened to us,'' but added that she was not bitter and was happy to be going home `` with our daughter.'' Attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, who represented the Pitts couple and Ms. <PERSON> Keetso </PERSON>, said permanent guardianship means the Pittses' relationship with <PERSON> Allyssa </PERSON> <PERSON> Keetso </PERSON>'s biological mother would not have to end, as it would under adoption However, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said, once the permanent guardianship is granted, Ms. <PERSON> Keetso </PERSON> would not be able to come back and claim custody of the child. Guardianship proceedings will begin within the next four months, he added. The agreement grants liberal visitation rights to the biological mother and other members of the baby's extended Indian family. The Pittses, both 33, were in the process of adopting <PERSON> Allyssa </PERSON> with the approval of Ms. <PERSON> Keetso </PERSON> when the <ORGANIZATION> Navajo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Courts </ORGANIZATION> intervened. Federal law gives tribal courts jurisdiction over the adoption of Indian children by non-Indians in certain instances. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said the couple wanted to adopt <PERSON> Allyssa </PERSON> and give her mother visitation rights, but tribal officials say adoption would sever the child's link with the tribe. Navajo law places strong emphasis on extended family. Under a guardianship, parental rights would remain with the biological mother even though the Pittses would raise the child. The couple would be legally considered the parents if they adopt the child. Ms. <PERSON> Keetso </PERSON>, 21, was pregnant and single when she contacted the Pittses through a newspaper ad. She lived with the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, couple for two months before and one month after <PERSON> Allyssa </PERSON> was born and said she wanted the couple to adopt her daughter. The child's maternal grandmother, <PERSON> Susie </PERSON> <PERSON> Keetso </PERSON>, also has said she wants the child to be turned over to the San Jose couple. Tribal officials have said they intervened after Mrs. <PERSON> Keetso </PERSON> expressed `` strong interest'' in having the child raised at the reservation. But earlier this week, Mrs. <PERSON> Keetso </PERSON> said she had been threatened with jail if she did not allow the tribe to intervene in the case.

 Three college students from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> have been fined a total of $ 1,300 for assaulting a waiter at a <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION> hotel after he told them to stop throwing doves into a swimming pool. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Guidara </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Norton </PERSON>, both of <LOCATION> Dorchester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, pleaded guilty to assault and causing grievous bodily harm and were fined at a magistrate court hearing on Thursday.

 Plainclothes police, seeking to prevent a meeting of the outlawed trade federation Solidarity, have detained three of its leaders, opposition activists said today. <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dluzyniewski </PERSON>, a member of Solidarity's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, was arrested today at his house. Police told him he was being detained 48 hours `` for his own good'' to prevent an illegal meeting, said <PERSON> Joanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON>, wife of Solidarity's national spokesman, <PERSON> Janusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON>. The other two detained leaders were <PERSON> Wladyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Frasyniuk </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stefania </PERSON> <PERSON> Hajmanowska </PERSON>. They are also members of <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, chaired by union leader and 1983 Nobel Peace Prize laureate <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> <PERSON> Frasyniuk </PERSON> was detained today, said Solidarity spokeswoman <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Labuda </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Wroclaw </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Hajmanowska </PERSON> was detained Friday, according to <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Romaszewski </PERSON>, a Solidarity leader in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> who monitors human rights cases. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> declined comment over the telephone from his home in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> about any plans for a meeting. Solidarity leaders presume their phone conversations are monitored by police. Solidarity was declared illegal after <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s 1981 martial law crackdown, but its leadership has remained active, especially since a 1986 political amnesty. Authorities frequently use fines and brief detentions to counter union activities, but no lengthy jail sentences of senior union leaders have been imposed since the amnesty. Meanwhile, police broke up an illegal printing operation in the western copper-mining town of <LOCATION> Glogow </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Labuda </PERSON> said today. Printing equipment and some underground publications were confiscated after a search of five private apartments that lasted six hours, she said. The five Solidarity activists whose apartments were searched were released but told they will likely face misdemeanor charges.

 <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> praised nuns, the pope and showed he `` definitely is reaching toward the church'' as he met for four hours with Cardinal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, the church leader says. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, the first Roman Catholic cardinal to visit <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> since <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> gained power in 1959, also said <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> indicated he would release up to 350 political prisoners if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> were to give them visas. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> asked for the church to see if it could play a role in smoothing the way for arrangements, and <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said he `` told him we would be happy to do this.'' And the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> leader also indicated he wants to restore normal diplomatic relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said at a news conference at <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> after he returned Friday from his four-day trip. Officially, <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> as a guest of the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the birth of the Rev. <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Varela </PERSON>, who served in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> from 1823 to 1853. When <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> if he could clear the way for Americans to visit sick relatives in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> said that would be no problem at all, the cardinal said. At one point, <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said he asked <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> for four more visas for <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON>'s Missionary Sisters of Charity. `` The instant I proposed it, he expressed great delight and granted -LRB- the visas -RRB- at that moment. He then went into great praise of the nuns in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. I've never heard nuns praised so highly,'' he said. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> also `` went into great praise of the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> and said he's certainly the world leader in terms of peace and in terms of constantly speaking about the poor,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said `` I do n't think there's any question that, for whatever motive, he's beginning to feel the needs of the church,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said of the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> president. Although <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> was friendly, <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said he was `` thinking all the time'' about whether the political figure was trying to exploit him. At first during their talks, <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> `` gave me an extensive tirade against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He told me he has long since learned to do without the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said. But he said he later got the feeling that `` he -LRB- <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> -RRB- would be delighted to re-establish a normal relationship'' with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said he expected that normal relations would include a resumption of trade and discussions at a diplomatic level as well as `` within a very short period of time the free flow of people going back and forth.'' And the possibility of greater openness toward the church also seemed a prospect in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which is considering allowing <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> to celebrate a Christmas Mass in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to be broadcast to a national audience, he said. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> prelate first mentioned the proposal Thursday at a news conference in <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>. The cardinal said he would prefer such a Mass on New Year's Day, so he could continue the tradition of celebrating midnight Christmas Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral. A televised Mass in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would be `` another move toward building a bridge,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said. `` The bridge has to be built. It may be a year. It may take a century.''

 It's butts out for about 80 percent of all domestic flights today, but airlines and experts have some healthy advice for inveterate smokers climbing the cabin walls: Take deep breaths, chew gun and snap a rubber band. The federal ban on smoking on domestic flights of less than two hours went into effect at 12:01 a.m. EDT today. `` I'll just have to smoke like a fiend until I get on,'' said <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fullerton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, as she prepared to board a flight at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. The regulation carries more than a wrist slap for violators: a fine of up to $ 1,000 for smoking and $ 2,000 for tampering with aircraft lavatory smoke alarms. Those who disobey a flight attendant's order to put out a cigarette could land in jail. Airlines say they may ask police to meet the plane at its next destination, or even divert the aircraft in cases involving unruly smokers. `` The majority of us absolutely support the new law,'' <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> flight attendant <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Haughton </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. `` I do n't look forward to the conflicts that will come with it, though. There are going to be problems. There are passengers who rip your head off on a 28-minute flight if they ca n't smoke.'' `` I'm thrilled. I'm so happy. I just ca n't breathe anymore on these flights,'' <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight attendant <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cale </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` I'm afraid to go to the doctor to have my lungs examined for fear of what they'll find.'' Not everyone was as thrilled. `` Flying is already stressful enough, and now they're going to make it worse if they wo n't let me smoke up there,'' said <PERSON> Lother </PERSON> <PERSON> Straschnitzki </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sonoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, waiting for his flight to be called at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. `` It's going to bother me a lot.'' `` I survived,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brand </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, who lit up the minute he stepped off his <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> flight from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. But the hopelessly hooked need n't despair. The airlines plan to offer substitutes for cigarettes, including hard candy and a chewing gum designed to lessen withdrawal symptoms. Dr. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preventive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, advises putting a rubber band around the wrist of your smoking hand and snapping it whenever a nicotine urge strikes. `` Our employees have been briefed,'' said <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Musto </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. `` The flight attendants, as the front-line people, will have to deal with it more than anybody.'' Under the new rules, airlines are required to announce before takeoff that smoking is prohibited, and to keep `` No Smoking'' lights illuminated. Even if a flight is delayed in the air or on the ground and goes beyond two hours, smoking will be prohibited if the schedule lists it as lasting two hours or less, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> is providing cinnamon hard candies to smokers, suggested by the American <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lung </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> as a cigarette substitute. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> is distributing more than 430,000 pieces of a gum called `` Ban Smoke,'' formulated to temporarily control the urge. <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, whose anti-smoking policy goes beyond the federal requirement by banning smoking on nearly all domestic flights, is handing out candies and mints as well as brochures. From <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, here are some suggestions from medical director Dr. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohn </PERSON>: _ If you usually smoke while sipping coffee, soft drinks or alcohol during flights, try switching to fruit juices, water or milk _ Strike up a conversation with a fellow passenger instead of striking a match Write letters or a business memo. _ Practice deep breathing _ Read a book or a magazine The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preventive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Southfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, has also developed a kit, called `` Flying Smokeless,'' that contains a cassette tape of behavior modification techniques and a `` smokeless emergency pack'' containing gum, mints and toothpicks. It sells for $ 11.45. The <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Smokers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, a charter service that was to begin service Friday from <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and permit smoking in all seats, has been forced to postpone service because of complications with federal regulations, company executives said.

 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> accused President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> of wrongly claiming superpower relations had warmed thanks to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pressure on the Soviets and suggested <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> stop sermonizing, the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported today. The agency said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> Friday that despite recently improved superpower relations, `` sermons are again being delivered to us and we are being instructed on how we should behave ourselves. `` Everything that has been achieved in Soviet-American relations is being ascribed to the policy of strength and ` putting pressure on the Soviets,''' the Soviet leader told <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, according to the agency. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was apparently referring to a foreign policy speech given by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Thursday in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. In it, the president said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> can not have `` a normal relationship'' unless <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> changes its ways and stops intervening in nations such as <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. After his meeting with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told reporters `` the going is hard'' in trying to conclude a treaty for sharply reducing long-range nuclear weapons that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> could sign at their May 29-June 2 summit in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Today <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> took a side trip in the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> to visit the sites of a stalled <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consulate and a World War II German atrocity. `` We have to say to ourselves always, never again,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said in a tribute to the 30,000 Jews and 70,000 Ukrainians who were herded into a ravine at <PERSON> Babi </PERSON> <PERSON> Yar </PERSON> and machine-gunned by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>. The consulate in <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION>, the third-largest city in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, was supposed to have opened by now, but construction has been halted and there is no target date for completion. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials cite security concerns, a tighter budget and Congressional opposition. Also, the Soviets would have a reciprocal right to open a consulate in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, which troubles some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and some <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials. In talks Thursday and Friday with Soviet leaders, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> sought to make headway on arms control problems and regional disputes. In a joint statement Friday, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet teams said negotiators would deal with the disputed issues `` on a priority basis.'' They reaffirmed their `` strong commitment to make an intensive effort'' to complete the treaty and said the summit `` should mark another important step in the process of building a more stable and constructive relationship.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> was also scheduled today to visit <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>, stop in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> to brief the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> Monday, then fly home. He is to hold another session with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> before the summit. A strategic arms reduction treaty would crown <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s fourth and probably final meeting with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as president. At a news conference, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said he could not promise an arms treaty before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s visit and he criticized any attempt to rush negotiations. He suggested that without a treaty, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> could still sign a document stating progress toward an accord. While <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms negotiators offered a new proposal in a dispute over air-launched cruise missiles, the treaty to sharply reduce <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet strategic nuclear weapons was still stymied in a dispute over `` Star Wars.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal would count as nuclear weapons all cruise missiles carried by fighter planes even though some may be conventionally armed. Both sides would have the right to develop air-launched cruises that were not nuclear, and the weapons would not be covered by the treaty. The idea is to bypass a dispute over verifying which of the cruise missiles carry nuclear arms. The Soviets agreed to study the proposal, a senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said at a briefing for reporters under rules of anonymity. Another major stumbling block in completing the treaty is finding ways to monitor <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet weapons to make sure cutbacks are not circumvented. On the regional front, the Soviets again refused to heed <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s appeal for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to declare an arms embargo against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Since the Soviets have veto power on the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, this means the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is unable to move for <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> sanctions against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The idea is to try to force compliance with a cease-fire ordered by the council last July in the Iran-Iraq war. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> also could not persuade the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to restore diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> after a 21-year break or to pledge to increase Jewish emigration, another <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said.

<TEXT>
 A TNT-laden pickup truck exploded today in a crowded vegetable market in the northern port city of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, killing at least 50 people and wounding 80 others, police said. The 8:45 a.m. -LRB- 2:45 a.m. EDT -RRB- explosion knocked down several buildings, gutted shops and set fire to dozens of cars in the low-income <LOCATION> Tabbaneh </LOCATION> district of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s second largest city, 50 miles north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The explosion occurred as Moslem shoppers filled the market on the seventh day of the holy month of <LOCATION> Ramadan </LOCATION>, when observing Moslems fast during daylight hours. It was the worst car bombing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in nearly three years. Police said the pickup, apparently used to transport vegetables, had been loaded with about 220 pounds of TNT. No group has claimed responsibility for the bombing, and police said they had no clue as to who was to blame. Civil defense teams dug through the rubble looking for trapped people. `` It was a real massacre. Several pedestrians and vendors were torn to pieces,'' said a police spokesman, who could not be identified under standing regulations. He said Syrian troops in charge of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>'s security cordoned off the blast area as ambulances with wailing sirens took casualties to hospitals. Car bombs are a by-product of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 13-year-old civil war between Moslems and Christians. More than 100,000 people have been killed since fighting broke out in 1975. A car bomb exploded outside an ice cream parlor in <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> on June 29, 1985, killing 50 people and wounding 110 as they celebrated the Fitr feast marking the end of <LOCATION> Ramadan </LOCATION>. Acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, a Sunni Moslem, condemned today's car bombing as a `` barbaric atrocity.'' `` All hands must team up to stop these executioners from committing further such crimes,'' he said. The city has a predominantly <LOCATION> Sunni </LOCATION> population of 850,000. There have been four bombings in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> in the last three months in which five people have been killed and 15 wounded. But police said none of them involved a car rigged with explosives. At least 57 people were killed and 288 wounded in 16 car bombings in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> last year.

 Police raided seven bars and nightclubs and rounded up about 80 Filipino barmaids and dancers and six foreigners in a crackdown on prostitution and illegal aliens, police said Saturday. Police said the four Britons and two Australians were arrested and detained pending deportation proceedings. They were accused of either managing or owning bars without valid business visas. The Friday night raids in the Ermita tourist district brought to about 2,000 the number of people, mostly women, rounded up since <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> police chief Brig.

 A socialite dubbed the `` fugitive temptress'' who allegedly seduced her lover into arranging her husband's murder, then ran away with another man, also captivated the investigator assigned to hunt her down. But for different reasons. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Naomi </PERSON> <PERSON> Cloud </PERSON>, 45, formerly of <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION>, was apprehended late Thursday in <LOCATION> Kennewick </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, after spending six years running from charges that she killed her husband. `` Well, she finally spent a night in jail. I waited a long time for this,'' a jubilant <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Meadows </PERSON>, an investigator for the <LOCATION> Mercer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutors office, told the <ORGANIZATION> Bluefield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> before heading back to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> today with Mrs. Cloud in custody. <PERSON> Meadows </PERSON> said he and other authorities captured Mrs. Cloud as she tried to slip out the back door of her house. Authorities traveled to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> after receiving a tip. `` She looked totally shocked,'' he said. `` She was very upset. She did n't say a word to me after we arrested her. Just gave me the dirty looks she used to give me before.'' Mrs. Cloud was charged with being a fugitive during a hearing Friday, said <LOCATION> Benton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION> -RRB- Sheriff <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> was set at $ 100,000 and she waived extradition proceedings, officials said. She had been charged with first-degree murder of her husband, <PERSON> David </PERSON>, who was gunned down in the yard of their home as the couple returned from a dinner party in <LOCATION> Bluefield </LOCATION> on Jan. 26, 1980. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Cloud </PERSON>, 56, was vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Carter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. Authorities allege Mrs. Cloud lured her boyfriend at the time, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Corprew </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Roanoke </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, into the plot to kill her husband, and <PERSON> Corprew </PERSON> in turn paid <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON> II of <LOCATION> Roanoke </LOCATION> $ 2,500 to be the triggerman. <PERSON> Corprew </PERSON> testified that Mrs. Cloud `` was like a spider and I was caught in her web.'' <PERSON> Corprew </PERSON> was sentenced to one to five years in prison for voluntary manslaughter as part of a plea bargain and was released after eight months. <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON> was convicted of first-degree murder in 1984 and sentenced to life in prison. His conviction was overturned by the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, but he was convicted of the same charge and received the same sentence again. Mrs. Cloud contended that her husband was shot in the face by a masked robber who emerged from the darkness as they returned from the dinner party. <LOCATION> Mercer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Prosecutor <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> said he became suspicious of her story, questioning why the man had n't robbed their house, why Mrs Cloud had been spared and why the assailant fled without taking any valuables. After she was indicted, Mrs. Cloud moved to <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>, where she worked as a car saleswoman and became romantically involved with <PERSON> Bernie </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>, authorities said. She and <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> fled just before her trial was to begin on May 17, 1982, officials said. Mrs. Cloud had put up as her bond a $ 50,000 building she owed in <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, but prosecutors said she sold the building before fleeing. <PERSON> Meadows </PERSON> said <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> authorities showed neighbors pictures from Mrs. Cloud's wanted poster and staked out her house once they determined the tip was accurate. Authorities nabbed Mrs. Cloud as she tried to walk out the back door while her boyfriend talked to police at the front door, <PERSON> Meadows </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> was not arrested and faces no charges, he said.

 The severed heads of two unidentified people were found in the Darjeeling region, where Gurkha militants have been campaigning for a separate homeland in eastern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> said the heads were found Friday in front of the office of the government-owned <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Sonada </LOCATION>, 15 miles west of Darjeeling town. There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but Gurkha militants were blamed for two similar beheadings earlier this month. On April 6, the severed head of school principal <PERSON> Dileswar </PERSON> <PERSON> Rai </PERSON> was found at the road crossing in <LOCATION> Kalimpong </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rai </PERSON> had defied the Gurkha call for a strike and kept his school open. The severed head of <PERSON> Nirmal </PERSON> <PERSON> Rai </PERSON>, a reporter for a local newspaper, was found at the same place on April 12. The reporter, not related to the principal, was accused of being a police informer. The attack on the teacher was claimed by the <ORGANIZATION> Gurkhaland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION>, one of several Gurkha rebel groups. Police also blamed Gurkha militants for the reporter's death. The Gurkhas, who are Indians of Nepalese descent, say they want a state of their own to protect their culture, language and tradition. The Darjeeling region now is part of Marxist-governed <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION> state. At least 275 people have since the Gurkhas began their homeland campaign in April 1986.

<HEAD>Battle Between Two Railroad Unions Flares</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An internecine battle between two unions representing most of the nation's operating railroad personnel is flaring just as both are sitting down with the industry to open a new round of contract talks. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardin </PERSON>, president of the 88,000-member <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, said in an interview he is launching an effort to take over the <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Locomotive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> `` with or without its consent.'' <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> McFather </PERSON>, president of the 28,000-member BLE, accused <PERSON> Hardin </PERSON> of `` engaging in an outright raiding campaign against our union'' and vowed an appropriate response that might include abandoning the <ORGANIZATION> UTU </ORGANIZATION> to its own devices at the bargaining table. The Locomotive Engineers, whose members are the highest paid among unionized rail workers, last week voted to affiliate with the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>, breaking a 125-year tradition of staying aloof from such alliances. `` The BLE has gone into a cave of protection,'' said <PERSON> Hardin </PERSON>, who pulled his own union out of the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> two years ago when the labor federation was preparing sanctions against it for trying to snare 2,000 <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> workers away from other unions. The <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>'s constitution prohibits its affiliated unions from seeking to acquire the members of any other union allied with the federation. <PERSON> Hardin </PERSON> said he had approached <PERSON> McFather </PERSON> and his two predecessors about absorbing the engineers into his union through what he called `` an honorable affiliation'' that would allow it to exercise autonomy. `` We ca n't continue with 15 separate unions in an industry that is merging and reorganizing every day and which has declined from a million workers to just 300,000,'' <PERSON> Hardin </PERSON> said. `` In as much as he -LRB- <PERSON> McFather </PERSON> -RRB- seems determined to remain a separate union, we have no alternative but to give the working engineers, through a representation election, the right to effect a merger,'' he said. Industry negotiators have vowed to reduce the carriers' unionized labor force by 25 percent, or 60,000 to 75,000 workers, over the next three years, largely by reducing the size of train crews who, except for locomotive engineers, mostly belong to the <ORGANIZATION> UTU </ORGANIZATION> To accomplish that with as little labor unrest as possible, one carrier, <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest, is offering severance payments of $ 50,000 to $ 75,000 for each departing worker. And in the first example of so-called `` gain sharing'' with rail unions, <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> also is offering to split 50-50 with the remaining workers the $ 475 million it will save from the job cuts. The layoffs would be accomplished by changing the current work rules between the unions and the railroads, which now require two brakemen, a conductor and an engineer on every train. Most rail labor leaders are hoping that whatever agreement is struck with <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> will set the pattern for the rest of the industry. While other unions are reluctantly yielding to the employment reductions in exchange for a share of the savings, the <ORGANIZATION> UTU </ORGANIZATION> has been the most resistant to the idea, largely because its members would lose the most jobs. `` The <ORGANIZATION> UTU </ORGANIZATION> is not about to make any agreement with <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> that would eliminate 9,000 <ORGANIZATION> UTU </ORGANIZATION> positions out of 10,000 altogether and then divide the money among all the remaining employees,'' he said. `` We do n't mind dividing the apple, but we want it divided evenly.'' <PERSON> McFather </PERSON> called <PERSON> Hardin </PERSON> `` a desperate union president motivated by his own perception that the <ORGANIZATION> UTU </ORGANIZATION> membership will decline over the next few years as two - and three-man crews become predominant. `` In many cases, we have been standing side by side with the <ORGANIZATION> UTU </ORGANIZATION> and not agreeing with the carriers on the crew issues,'' <PERSON> McFather </PERSON> said. `` If Mr. <PERSON> Hardin </PERSON> is going to raid our union, we may be more receptive to negotiating agreements.'' Ironically, both officials agreed their dispute is only going to hurt their bargaining position with the railroads. <PERSON> Hardin </PERSON> said the railroads are sure to `` capitalize on any friction and discord among the unions.'' `` This is not the time to be fighting this kind of war,'' <PERSON> McFather </PERSON> said. `` Anytime the carriers can keep our organizations pitted against each other, they always come out better off.''

 A measure to build a gambling hall that initially was approved by two votes lost out in a recount, but proponents said they would go to court to have a judge review the ballots. A recount Friday gave the proposal a 755-755 time, meaning that it was defeated, said town clerk <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Reneke </PERSON>. The proposal would have established a card room with as many as 60 tables, a restaurant and cocktail lounge in this financially strapped river town. ` It's been a very long, stressful time for all of us,'' <PERSON> Reneke </PERSON> said. Backers of the multimillion-dollar plan said they planned to go into <LOCATION> Solano </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Superior </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION> to ask a judge to review the ballots. `` We will persist,'' said <PERSON> Monte </PERSON> <PERSON> McFall </PERSON>, a proponent of the plan. `` Three of our votes were not counted. If one of those votes is counted, we will win.'' The proposal was defeated by voters last November by 30 votes. In both campaigns, opponents were led by local church leaders.

<HEAD>Japanese Farmers Burn U.S. Flag, Car In Rally, Talks Stalemated</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Farmers smashed and burned an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> car, torched boxes of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oranges and set fire to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag in a rally Saturday protesting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demands that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> end its restrictions on imported beef and oranges. The violence came as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiators ended a week of meetings on trade with no new agreements. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative Saturday left for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after failing to persuade <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to drop import quotas on citrus and beef. `` The two sides remain very far apart, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, deputy representative. `` My own opinion is that we moved further apart,'' he told a news conference at the American Embassy before his departure. About 300 farmers chanted `` Down with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demands'' while a man jumped onto an American car and smashed its windows with a large hammer. The farmers, wearing head bands saying `` Protect Japanese agriculture'' in the rain, then piled boxes of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oranges on the car and set it on fire along with a large American flag. Three members of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s parliament, including former Vice Minister of Agriculture <PERSON> Seishiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Eto </PERSON>, attended the rally in the town of <LOCATION> Kokonone </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Kyushu </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Scenes of the demonstration were shown on evening television news broadcasts. <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said the farmers destroying the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> car were following the example of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressmen who smashed a tape recorder made by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in July last year. The congressmen were protesting sales of high-technology milling machines to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> by a <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said the two sides differ on three important issues: <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> wants a transition period before it fully opens its market; it wants to negotiate the level of foreign access during the transition; and, after the market is open, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> wants new or additional `` border measures'' such as tariffs to protect its markets. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> would agree to a transition period as long as <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> reciprocates by significantly increasing foreign access to its markets. Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister <PERSON> Takashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sato </PERSON> will leave for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> this week to continue the talks, he said. Japanese newspapers said Saturday the government has decided to liberalize <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s beef imports in three years and orange imports in five years to help defuse trade friction with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, its main ally and trading partner. In exchange, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> would impose a surcharge on American beef and allow imports to increase by about 15 percent a year, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Mainichi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. An increase in surcharges on oranges is prohibited under international trade rules established by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. But <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said import surcharges are out of the question. He declined to say which points the two sides agreed on, saying the whole package must be negotiated and `` today's numbers are yesterday's history.'' The two sides have been negotiating since Tuesday, trying to reach agreement on a new package after the previous beef and oranges agreement expired April 1. In another set of consultations, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> asked the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to lift the penalty tariffs it imposed on Japanese color televisions, calculators, computers and power drills over alleged Japanese violations of an agreement on sales of computer chips, but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> refused, saying `` the sanctions will be lifted once the arrangement is functioning as intended.'' The two sides also held discussions on structural changes in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s economy and Japanese demands that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> reduce its budget deficit and do more to stimulate its own economy. The biggest topic of the week turned out to be an item that was not on the agenda _ a 312-107 vote by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> approving a comprehensive trade bill that retaliates against <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The move punishes <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> for a subsidiary's sale of sensitive high technology equipment to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and gives the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative more power in dealing with complaints of unfair trade practices by foreign countries. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade official said the timing of the vote was coincidental and was not designed to send a special message to the Japanese during the week of talks. International Trade and Industry Minister <PERSON> Hajime </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamura </PERSON> protested the measure and called on President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to veto the bill. `` I suspect that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> was guilty of racial discrimination and anti-Japanese sentiment in passing the trade bill,'' Japanese newspapers quoted him as saying. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallis </PERSON>, visiting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> undersecretary of state for economic affairs, said Friday he assured <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would veto the bill in its present form. The House can override the veto with a two-thirds' vote. Last year <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> bought about $ 28 billion in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports, second only to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> bought 38 percent of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s exports, making it <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s biggest trading partner, <PERSON> Wallis </PERSON> said

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the likely Democratic nominee, says he considers Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` extremely vulnerable'' in a host of international matters and while a relative novice in foreign affairs, `` I also have some rather strongly held views.'' With a rare edge in his voice, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ran quickly through his brief against <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, mentioning arms-for-hostages, support for former <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> dictator <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, a `` failed and illegal policy in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' and `` seven precious years doing virtually nothing'' about the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. `` What good is experience if that's what it produces?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> asked, trying out a line for the general election that would bind <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to the policies of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. In an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spoke at length about his foreign policy views and declared himself eager to go after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on foreign and military affairs. `` I think the vice president is extremely vulnerable on foreign policy. It's going to be an issue. Believe me, I'm going to take that issue to him and the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, talking through a hasty lunch last Thursday in his Statehouse office. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was asked point-blank whether he could imagine himself unleashing a nuclear warhead. `` I do n't think it will be necessary,'' he said. `` But if the policy of nuclear deterrence means what it says, then that has to be a possibility. Otherwise, nuclear deterrence does n't mean anything.'' In his view, Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> recognizes the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is facing grave internal problems, especially in its sagging economy. In the past three years alone, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has been buffeted by the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear disaster and a pending withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> while at the same time expressing a willingness to reduce nuclear arms and conventional forces. `` All of this is very new, very different. I think principally because <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> recognizes that they're falling farther and farther behind in an economic sense. The Soviet economic system is failing, and they're got to open up that system, or they're going to become a second - or third-rate economic power,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said While some Americans might welcome a weakened Soviet state, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> does not. `` I think an insecure, failing <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is not in our national interest. I'm not saying that a militarily powerful, adventurous <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is in our interest. But continued political instability in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, failure to grapple with serious problems _ I do n't think that's in the best interest of world peace and world stability,'' he said. In a still-hypothetical general election, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> might be expected to try to tag <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as a traditional Democratic dove in the cast of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON>. But while <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> may sound like <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> on <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> talks tough about drawing a line around <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` Look. We're not going to tolerate a Soviet satellite in this hemisphere. And it's important to define those terms. ... I'm talking about a country that is a base for Soviet military power and is engaging in systematic subversion of its neighbors We're not going to tolerate that. In foreign policy terms, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, as a third-term governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, has a political problem and a political opportunity. He lacks depth of personal experience, especially compared to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ a former ambassador, <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director and now vice president. The same inexperience was true of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, both of whom came to the presidency by way of the statehouse rather than <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Yet at the same time the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor does not have to defend a record not of his own making, and he has a relatively clean slate on which to write his own doctrines. And he does n't lack for self-confidence; while he is being urged to select a vice president with foreign-policy expertise, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says his secretary of state will handle those chores In the interview, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> _ who speaks Spanish, Greek and French but has not traveled extensively _ acknowledged that he has learning to do. `` Of course. You never stop learning in politics,'' he said. `` You work at this all the time. But I also have some rather strongly held views on the subject of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> foreign policy. And I think if you're going to run for the presidency, you've got a responsibility to express those views, and to do so with as much information and knowledge as you can possibly pull together.'' As for his own views, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is most emphatic on two points: ending the shooting in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and turning the U.S.-Soviet relationship into a peaceful blend of rivalry and cooperation. `` There's no question that managing that relationship is going to be probably the single most important foreign policy responsibility the president has,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` The next president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will probably have the best opportunity in our lifetimes to make real progress in not only building that relationship but on arms control and arms reduction, on reducing and eliminating regional conflict, on making the competition peaceful and not military between the two superpowers.''

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than 200 Soviet trucks and armored vehicles lumbered out of the capital at dawn Saturday for <LOCATION> Lowgar </LOCATION> province, where Moslem guerrillas have stepped up attacks as <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> prepares its troops to withdraw. Many ground convoys and transport planes have been leaving <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> in recent days to resupply Soviet positions and the vulnerable Afghan army, according to residents and Western diplomats. The Soviets agreed April 14 in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> to withdraw their estimated 115,000 troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> more than eight years after <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> intervened to prop up the Marxist government. The withdrawal is to begin May 15. But the agreement is far from a peace accord. Guerrilla activities, including bombings in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> itself, have increased since February with the approach of spring and the melting of snow in the northern <LOCATION> Hindu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kush </LOCATION> and other mountain ranges. An alliance of seven Moslem guerrilla groups, whose headquarters are across the Afghan-Pakistani frontier, rejected the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accord because it does not guarantee a cutoff of Soviet aid to President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s Afghan government. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, according to officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, will not halt its arms supplies to the guerrillas until the Soviets stop supplying <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s troops. Meanwhile, the Soviets are are preparing for an escalation of guerrilla attacks in areas that will be the last to be vacated, according to foreign analysts. <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s rugged geography has made it a nightmare for foreign armies since <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> the Great's short-lived conquest in the fourth century. Soviet watchposts on the road around <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> show signs of recent fortification. There is fresh concrete and stonework around Soviet sentry posts. Bunkers are newly draped with camouflage netting, Western diplomats said. <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, hub of Soviet operations, is expected to be one of the last two cities the Soviets leave before the final withdrawal deadline of Feb. 15, 1989. The other is <LOCATION> Mazar-e-Sharif </LOCATION>, 40 miles south of the Soviet border on a dusty plain along the <LOCATION> Oxus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. During a tightly supervised seven-and-a-half hour visit arranged by the Afghan government on Friday, several signs of Soviet presence were visible there. Soviet army fuel trucks were parked near 20 Afghan air force MIG-21 fighter planes at the airport, a dozen Soviet soldiers went about their work, and storefronts showed the Cyrillic lettering used by the Soviets. According to Western diplomats and Afghan officials, all speaking on condition of anonymity, the Soviet pullout will probably start at their most exposed positions. These include bases near the Pakistani border. Meanwhile, the Soviets have plenty to worry about. According to a report compiled by Western diplomats, 22 bombs exploded in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> in March, compared with 10 in February. They included magnetic bombs with timing devices that can be attached to vehicles, one diplomat said. Other guerrilla activities in recent weeks included curtailing movement on roads linking <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> with other major cities, according to the diplomat and residents. The diplomat said the guerrillas cut the road to <LOCATION> Ghazni </LOCATION>, 75 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, on April 14. A reporter who flew over the road a week later saw only a dozen vehicles on a normally well-traveled section of the road. <LOCATION> Lowgar </LOCATION> province, which abuts the <LOCATION> Kabul-Ghazni </LOCATION> road, is `` very insecure,'' one Western source said. Indeed, the Soviet convoy that headed there Saturday showed signs of apprehension. It included eight T-62 tanks, at least a dozen armored personnel carriers, a score or more of trucks loaded with coal, and about 10 trucks carrying communications gear. Many trucks had metal plates that covered the lower half of the windshield on the driver's side and left only a brick-sized opening on the passenger's side. The drivers, many of whom appeared to be teen-agers, wore helmets and flak jackets. Some trucks were mounted with anti-aircraft guns. The guerrillas do not have aircraft, so the guns would presumably be used to attack their mountain positions.

<HEAD>Welfare Overhaul Reflects Changed Society</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Overwhelming dissatisfaction with the welfare system is pushing <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> toward major revisions in a program that started 53 years ago, before working women, teen-age mothers and child poverty were commonplace. The overhaul bills passed last year by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and last week by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> acknowledge, as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill puts it, `` the vastly changed family arrangements of the intervening half century'' since the start of the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program. Both bills stress family responsibility and community obligation _ parental responsibility to support children and the community's obligation to make that feasible through expanded education and training opportunities And, to varying degrees, both bills would improve benefits for families who absolutely must rely on government assistance. Preliminary estimates by the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> put the five-year cost of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill at $ 7.1 billion and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill at $ 2.8 billion. Whatever emerges from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will be more extensive than the $ 913 million plan backed by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, and is likely to draw a veto. Nevertheless, liberals and conservatives remain convinced that the system must be changed and many of them are in agreement on how to do it. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill is co-sponsored by a majority of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. And while the House bill was passed without <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> backing, some Republicans indicated they could accept the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approach. Following is a comparison of major provisions in the two bills. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill may be amended on the floor, and the final product likely will combine features of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bills.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CASH BENEFITS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Senate: Changes AFDC to the Child Support Supplement Program. Requires all states to provide assistance to two-parent families in which the principal wage-earner is unemployed -LRB- currently an option picked up by half the states -RRB-, but benefits may be limited to six months. No change in the amount of earnings or child care costs that states must disregard in determining who gets benefits. House: Changes AFDC to the Family Support Program. Requires all states to provide assistance to two-parent families in which the principal wage-earner is unemployed. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> must recommend a national minimum benefit level within two years. States would receive a 25 percent increase in their federal matching share for any benefit increases between Oct. 1, 1988 and Oct. 1, 1991.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>WORK</HEAD>
<TEXT>

</TEXT>
<HEAD>Basic Program</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Senate: States would replace the existing, small-scale Work Incentive program -LRB- WIN -RRB- with a comprehensive Job Opportunities and Basic Skills -LRB- JOBS -RRB- program. JOBS must include basic education and skills training plus other activities chosen by the states. House: States would replace WIN with a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, Training and Work -LRB- NETWork -RRB- program. The program must offer high school, remedial education, bilingual education and other specific activities. Community work experience, also known as workfare, must teach marketable skills and last no longer than six months.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Who Must Participate</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Senate: Able-bodied adults, including parents of children over age 3 or, at state option, age 1. If the child is under 6, required participation is limited to 24 hours a week. States must guarantee that child care is available. The federal government helps pay for child care and transportation. House: Able-bodied adults, including parents of children over age 3 or, at state option, age 1. If the child is under 6, required participation is limited to 20 hours a week. States with the lower age requirement must demonstrate that infant care is available for $ 200 a month or less. The federal government helps pay for child care and transportation costs.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Wages</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Senate: People do not have to accept a job if it pays less than their cash benefits combined with food stamps and Medicaid, unless the state makes up the difference with a supplemental benefit. House: Wages must be at least equal to whatever is highest _ the federal minimum wage, the state minimum wage or the pay rate for people in similar positions with the same employer. People do not have to accept jobs if the result is a net loss of income, including the insurance value of Medicaid.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Financing</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Senate: Federal government pays for 90 percent of the JOBS program up to the amount the states received last year under WIN. After that the federal contribution would range from 60 to 80 percent, except that administrative costs are split 50-50. Federal outlays are capped at $ 3 billion over five years; states are only expected to seek about one-third of that amount as they gear up their programs. House: Similar, except no cap on federal spending.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Work Transition</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Senate: States must provide child care for nine months to families that lose cash benefits due to earnings. Families must contribute to the cost. States must continue Medicaid for six months for such families, and may offer Medicaid for another six months to those with incomes below 185 percent of the federal poverty standard. Those above poverty level _ $ 11,650 for a family of four _ would be a charged a premium. House: States must provide child care for at least a year to families losing benefits due to earnings, unless family income in prior quarter was more than 150 percent of the poverty level. Families must contribute on a sliding fee scale. No Medicaid provision.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CHILD SUPPORT</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>: Federal government would pay 90 percent of cost of lab tests used to establish paternity.

 The Arab hijackers who held a <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> jet for 16 days and killed two of its passengers have been traced to the stronghold of pro-Iranian extremists in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, diplomatic sources said Saturday. Arab and Western diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the hijackers were believed to have made their getaway in an Algerian air force plane via the Syrian capital of <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> before dawn Wednesday. The sources said the leader of the hijackers was believed to be <PERSON> Izzedine </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> hardliner known to have been involved in the 1985 <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> hijacking in which an American was killed. `` Various diplomatic security and counter-terrorist agencies are trying to keep track of the gang,'' one diplomat said. `` The men are believed to have gone underground with <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> in a largely Shiite part of west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> where their trail is easily lost.'' <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, is a pro-Iranian Shiite radical movement that holds Western hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, the chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, is among their captives. On Saturday, the hijacked <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 was still being examined at <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> airport by Algerian security men and aviation specialists. A Kuwaiti crew was standing by to fly it home as soon as the Algerians give the go-ahead. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and other Western governments have paid tribute to the Algerians for negotiating the release of the last 31 hostages without further violence. But they have criticized <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> for allowing the hijackers to escape unpunished. Flight 422, carrying 112 passengers, was hijacked April 5 on a flight from <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. It landed first in <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, where 57 passengers were released. Then it went to <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, where 13 captives were freed and two others were killed. The plane flew to <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> and upon touching down one hostage was released for medical reasons. On Wednesday, after lengthy negotiations with Algerian authorities, the remaining hostages were freed. <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>'s state-run media rejected criticism as `` arrogant and hypocritical interference'' in the nation's internal affairs, and asked why the West did not display similar concern over `` state terrorism'' carried out by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The sources said Algerian negotiators worked out a meticulous and elaborate deal with the hijackers during the six days the plane was held at <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>' <LOCATION> Houari </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boumedienne </LOCATION> airport. One diplomat, who received a continuous Algerian progress report while the negotiations were going on, said the secret talks were concerned more with assuring the hijackers' unimpeded getaway than with the fate of the hostages. `` While the plane was still on the ground in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, the Algerians received a promise that the hostages would not be harmed on Algerian soil,'' the source said. `` The Algerian negotiators thereupon allowed the plane to take off for <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> and then took the hijackers at their word. Events proved them right.'' Whether the Algerians were right to observe their part of the bargain and help the hijackers escape after the hostages were freed `` is essentially a philosophical question over the validity of bargaining under duress,'' another diplomat said. `` While we are appreciative of the Algerian efforts to avoid further bloodshed, we do not see eye-to-eye with them on this other aspect of the problem.'' <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> has repeatedly played the role of `` honest broker'' in negotiating the release of hijack and kidnap victims, including the American hostages from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> in 1981 and the <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> passengers in 1985. Algerian officials said <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> would forfeit its ability to play such a role in the future if it was seen to doublecross one of the parties to a compromise. The diplomats said they believed the hijackers may have been taken to <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> on Wednesday in a special plane carrying a high-ranking Algerian official, <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Cherif </PERSON> <PERSON> Messadia </PERSON>, to the Syrian capital for talks with President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>. Messadia is generally regarded as the number two man in the Algerian government after President <PERSON> Chadli </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON>. His presence may have given the hijackers some assurance their aircraft would not be intercepted enroute.

<HEAD>Irony In Legal Battle For Entertainer's Millions</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In 1963, <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> was hospitalized in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> with a near-fatal illness and his doctors told him to put his affairs in order. He did, giving away most of his possessions and spending thousands of dollars on gifts for friends. After weeks in intensive care, the flashy entertainer recovered and found himself rebuilding his life, physically and financially. Never again, he vowed, would he give away his wealth at the whim of someone or something out of his control. But now, a year after his death, <ORGANIZATION> Liberace </ORGANIZATION>'s millions are the subject of controversy again. And a bitter court battle he would have detested is being waged to determine who will head the foundation he set up to help aspiring young artists. <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON> Angie </PERSON>, his manager of 36 years and three other associates have filed suit against <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Strote </PERSON>, charging he got <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> to sign a new will 13 days before he died at his <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, home. The will named <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> as executor of the estate and head of a trust to funnel money to the <ORGANIZATION> Liberace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> for the Performing Arts. The 100 pages of death-bed documents gave <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> full control of an estate valued at $ 20 million. <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> said <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> called him to his <LOCATION> Malibu </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, home three weeks before he died on Feb. 5, 1987, asking that the will be drawn and that longtime manager <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> <PERSON> Heller </PERSON> be removed from any position of control. The suit contends <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> took advantage of <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>, who was dying of an illness brought on by complications from AIDS. It asks that Strote be removed as executor and head of the trust. The case has gone to trial, and <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> spent several hours on the witness stand in <LOCATION> state </LOCATION> <LOCATION> district </LOCATION> court last week, with a return scheduled Monday. He testified that his actions have been in the best interests of <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>'s estate and foundation, and that his activities as a lawyer and executor of the estate are dictated by law. He declined Thursday to comment on the legal battle. During a break in the trial, <PERSON> Heller </PERSON> bemoaned <PERSON> Strote </PERSON>'s actions since taking over as executor. He said <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> had taken priceless heirlooms that belonged in a Liberace museum and sold them at auction in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> earlier this month. The auction netted an estimated $ 2 million for the foundation. `` He even sold the man's driver's license,'' <PERSON> Heller </PERSON> said disgustedly. `` Can you imagine that? He sold some of the gifts my wife and I gave to <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>. They had our names engraved on them.'' The other plaintiffs are <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> McMahon </PERSON>, housekeeper at <ORGANIZATION> Liberace </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> home; <PERSON> Gladys </PERSON> <PERSON> Luckie </PERSON>, housekeeper in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Cary </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, a longtime companion of <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>. The attorney for the five plaintiffs, <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Gewerter </PERSON>, charged in opening statements that <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> had talked to <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> about a new will Jan. 15, 1987, then had 100 pages of legal documents drawn up and returned a week later for <ORGANIZATION> Liberace </ORGANIZATION>'s signature. `` Liberace was in such a mental state on the 22nd that he could n't understand or read independently,'' <PERSON> Gewerter </PERSON> said. `` If Pee Wee <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> had walked into his room and said he wanted to be executor, he -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Liberace </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- would have said ` yes.' He -LRB- Strote -RRB- goes into that room owning nothing and comes out with a bag of goodies.'' Gewerter charged that <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> had taken hundreds of thousands of dollars from the estate. <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>'s determination to control who would benefit from his estate stemmed from his hospitalization in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> on Nov. 22, 1963, when he suffered uremic poisoning after inhaling carbon tectrachloride fumes from a fluid he was using to clean a costume. He was hospitalized in intensive care for weeks. `` The doctors told me to ` put my house in order,''' he recalled in later interviews. `` It's a funny way to tell a man to get ready to die.'' He was given last rites and told he had about $ 750,000 in the bank after taking care of charities and individuals he had included in his will. He then went on a deathbed buying binge: a <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> home for his sister, furs and jewelry for his mother, a boat for one of his 28 staff members, cars, motorcycles, etc. `` If you think a drunken sailor spends money carelessly, you should get a load of a rich piano player when he thinks he's dying,'' <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> wrote

 Eritrean rebels shelled <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s biggest port and its only oil refinery, diplomats and the official news agency said Five people were reported killed and 15 wounded. In an unprecedented report on the civil war in the north, the <ORGANIZATION> Ethiopian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday that the rebels launched attack on the port of <LOCATION> Assab </LOCATION> at midnight Tuesday from a boat at nearby <LOCATION> Senabor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. `` Bandits who are bent on creating havoc to lives and property fired shells at the town,'' the news agency reported. `` A team from the <LOCATION> Ethiopian </LOCATION> navy immediately took action and blew up the boat in which the rebels had infiltrated the area. The boat was reported to have capsized with the rebels in it,'' said the agency. Western diplomats said it was believed to be the first rebel attack on the port 530 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>, the capital of the Marxist government. <LOCATION> Assab </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Massawa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s only other port of significance, are both in <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION>, where the secessionist <ORGANIZATION> Eritrean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> has been fighting for 27 years in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s oldest civil war. The rebels also are Marxist. The diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they believed <LOCATION> Assab </LOCATION> refinery was not damaged but were unsure about the port, which controls up to 80 percent of this East African nation's imports and exports, including emergency food for 7 million drought victims The official news agency did not say whether the port or refinery were damaged. It also did not report how many rebels were involved in the attack, nor did it indicate what type of weapons they used. The agency also disclosed for the first time that rebels of the <ORGANIZATION> Tigrean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> recently destroyed one of the microwave relay stations connecting the Eritrean capital, <LOCATION> Asmara </LOCATION>, to the rest of the country. Tigrean rebels took up arms 14 years ago, demanding a bigger say in governing their province. The news agency made no reference to a claim by the <ORGANIZATION> Eritrean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> that it shot down a MiG-21 fighter jet Friday and captured the pilot, identified as Capt. <PERSON> Tilahun </PERSON> <PERSON> Begarso </PERSON>. Voice of the Broad Masses of <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION>, the clandestine rebel radio, said the plane was hit during ongoing fighting northeast of <LOCATION> Asmara </LOCATION>. It claimed 100 government soldiers were killed and 216 wounded in a battle there Thursday. The <LOCATION> Assab </LOCATION> attack report is the first of its kind since President <PERSON> Mengistu </PERSON> <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariam </PERSON> ended years of official silence March 30 about insurgencies in the northernmost neighboring provinces of <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tigre </LOCATION>. In his first admission that his government is at war, <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION> announced an imminent offensive against the rebels, who have captured several towns in major victories this year. No foreign relief agencies have been based in <LOCATION> Assab </LOCATION> since the government on April 6 expelled about 60 Western relief workers from the war-torn provinces, citing `` personnel risks.'' The expulsions have jeopardized a massive Western-funded emergency relief operation to help an estimated 3.2 million people threatened with starvation in <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Tigre </PERSON>, the provinces worst hit by drought. This week, following a visit by a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> troubleshooter, the government allowed back into <LOCATION> Asmara </LOCATION> four <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> workers who supervise trucking and a big airlift of relief food forced by the war. <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON>, assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> secretary of state, charged in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Saturday that <LOCATION> Mengistu </LOCATION> banned the foreigners to remove witnesses as the government prepares for all-out war. `` He does n't want anyone to see what's going on up there because it's going to be bloody,'' <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> subcommittees of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>' Foreign Affairs Committee. Western diplomats and relief officials have expressed similar fears. They have accused the government and rebels of jeopardizing the lives of drought victims in pursuit of military victory. <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION> inherited the insurgencies when, with a clique of military officers, he helped overthrow Emperor <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Selassie </PERSON> in 1974.

<HEAD>Rights Group Says Panama Guilty of Abuses</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s military-dominated government has engaged in a widespread pattern of human rights abuses, including the beating and jailing of protestors and mistreatment of prisoners, according to a report by a human rights group released Saturday. The report, prepared by <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Watch </LOCATION>, a private, New York-based group, said <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> authorities have mixed political prisoners with violent criminals in substandard conditions, engaged in vandalism and silenced opposition news media. Discussing anti-government demonstrations, the report said, `` hundreds of people appear to have been arrested solely for the non-violent expression of their political beliefs.'' The study said the abuses have been particularly severe since <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s political crisis erupted last June. It described the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's policy toward the alleged repression in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> as `` uneven and often contradictory.'' The report was written by <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Zalaquett </PERSON>, a consultant to <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Watch </LOCATION>, after a mission to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> last September. But some of the alleged abuses described in the report occurred in recent weeks. Last Wednesday, the Panamanian government lifted a `` state of urgency'' that was imposed after an abortive coup attempt a month ago. The crackdown permitted the government to suspend a wide range of civil liberties, including freedom of speech and assembly and the right to private property. While the report said that some of the more flagrant abuses could be eliminated by the departure of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s military chief, <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, others will be eliminated only through the decisive action of a new government. Such a government, among other steps, should guarantee that future elections are free and fair and take steps to ensure that the military does not interfere with the political process, the report said. It added that American policy toward <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> `` seems to have been dictated by constantly changing calculations about what best ensures stability in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.'' For years, the report said, `` the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration chose not to criticize the regimes controlled by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, even as the general consolidated his power and corruption reached new depths.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who has headed <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> since 1983, is under federal indictment on drug smuggling charges. The report said that even though the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> knew the 1984 presidential elections in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> were rigged by the military, Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> gave his blessing to the process by attending the inauguration of the new president. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> has denied that any such information was available at the time of the election. The report said the administration, in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and other countries, pursued an inconsistent human rights policy. `` Concern for human rights violations and for a lack of democratic practices is too often voiced at the 11th hour when the administration faces a volatile situation with potential national security implications,'' it said.

 <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarland </PERSON> believes his rising medical claims for a diabetic condition cost him his job, along with his company health insurance, but today he has hope in a new state law that he thinks will `` save myself and my family from potential financial ruin.'' <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' universal health care act was signed into law last week by Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, a Democratic presidential contender who has touted it as an example for the rest of the country. The first-in-the-nation measure promises to make affordable health insurance available to all residents, rich or poor, working or unemployed, by 1992. <PERSON> McFarland </PERSON>, 53, knows something about health insurance. The job he lost was as a chief fraud investigator for a major <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> insurance company, his employer of 13 years. While other factors may have been involved in his termination, <PERSON> McFarland </PERSON> is convinced that the claims he filed for six $ 1,000 diabetes-related eye operations played a major role. And since he began working as a self-employed financial consultant, <PERSON> McFarland </PERSON> has found himself `` effectively in a Catch-22 situation'' in trying to get health insurance because his diabetes is considered a non-coverable, pre-existing condition. `` My efforts have indicated to me I could n't even get -LRB- a policy -RRB- that would cover diabetes, irrespective of the dollars of premium I were able to pay,'' he said. `` In other words, I can get coverage except for the coverage that I need.'' Enter the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> universal health care plan, under which by 1992, or possibly sooner, the state will broker pooled insurance for small businesses and individuals which participants can buy into on a sliding fee schedule based on their income. The details of what these plans will offer will be decided later by the new state agency that will manage the system. But <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunham </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' health policy adviser, said pre-existing conditions will definitely be covered. `` This is really landmark legislation,'' <PERSON> McFarland </PERSON> said. `` It's recognizing, in my judgment, that health care is a right, rather than a privilege. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says the four-year phase-in will cost the state $ 645.2 million, minus about $ 22.5 million in projected Medicaid cost-cutting. But some estimates have run as high as $ 1.2 billion. The law would extend coverage to about 600,000 <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> residents under age 65 currently without health insurance, or roughly one of every 10 people in the commonwealth. This would be done in stages and through a variety of approaches, from extending Medicaid benefits for disabled adults and children to state - brokered, pooled insurance for small businesses and individuals By 1992, all employers with more than five full-time employees must offer health insurance coverage or pay an unemployment surcharge to help the state provide this coverage to the uninsured. <PERSON> Jeannette </PERSON> <PERSON> Capone </PERSON>, 52, lives in <LOCATION> Athol </LOCATION> with her healthy 14-year-old daughter and her 68-year-old husband, who has chronic emphysema and has n't been able to work for a dozen years. When her family was younger and she had five children living at home, <PERSON> Capone </PERSON> briefly went on welfare. But she hated the condescension she felt from neighbors and welfare workers so she found work in part-time jobs that would allow her to continue caring for her homebound husband. Today, <PERSON> Capone </PERSON> does light cleaning for a company that recently began offering health insurance to full-time employees. But <PERSON> Capone </PERSON> is n't covered because she only works about 20 hours a week. <PERSON> Capone </PERSON> gets free indigent medical care for herself and her daughter through her local hospital's emergency room. Her husband's major medical expenses are covered by Medicare, but she still has to pay for the seven medications he has to take, costing $ 40 to $ 45 a week. `` What breaks me up is that I can apply for welfare, I can apply for Medicaid'' and all her medical expenses will be paid, she said. But to be eligible, she would have to quit her job. `` I want to work, I want to help and do things on my own,'' she said. The state this year will allow disabled adults like her husband to buy into the Medicaid program according to their ability to pay. And in 1992, most employers will be required to offer health insurance to employees working at least 20 hours per week.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> warned today that continuing Iranian terrorist and military attacks against neutral parties `` will be very costly to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and its people.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> added comments on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to his weekly radio speech, which dealt mostly with trade policy, as officials disclosed that his administration will expand the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> role in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> by allowing American warships to aid neutral merchant ships under attack. `` We are very pleased with the role that the European allies are playing in a cooperative effort to counter the Iranian mining threat and to help protect freedom of navigation,'' the president said in his speech from Camp David. `` Such cooperative efforts, supported by our Gulf Arab friends, offer the best means of deterring <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and enhancing gulf security,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` Working together,'' he said, `` we can put new life into <ORGANIZATION> UN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> efforts to end the increasingly bloody, inhumane Iran-Iraq war and remove the root cause of tensions in the gulf.'' `` Our role in this war is neutral and we do not seek to confront <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>,'' the president said. `` However, its leaders must understand that continued military and terrorist attacks against nonbelligerents and refusal to negotiate an end to the war will be very costly to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and its people.'' The plan for a more active role in the gulf is a direct result of the mining of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> frigate and Monday's extensive fighting between Iranian and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces, administration officials said Friday. The administration is seeking support from congressional leaders and allied governments for the new policy, under which <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> warships would no longer ignore Iranian attacks on merchant ships that were n't flying the American flag. If a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship observed an Iranian attack and was close enough to intervene, it would have the authority to do so, said the officials, who agreed to discuss the matter only if not identified. `` It's a random, target-of-opportunity approach designed to throw the Iranians off guard,'' said one source. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> has since last summer guarded American-flagged Kuwaiti tankers, which had come under special fire from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in the gulf. Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, D-Wis., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, confirmed the new policy had been discussed Friday with congressional leaders He said the policy would `` enable <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> vessels to defend themselves fully and to take appropriate action to deal with specific circumstances.'' Although <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> refused to discuss specifics, another <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> source who was briefed on the matter said, `` This will give a lot of authority to local commanders and a lot of leeway to do as they see fit.'' The new policy assumes <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, at war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for 7 -LCB- years, will not attack neutral merchant ships operating between neutral ports. It thus is intended to apply specifically in cases of neutral merchant ships under Iranian attack. `` Our purpose is not to get into a war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>,'' said an official. `` Our purpose is to secure safe passage for neutral shipping moving back and forth between neutral ports.'' The sources stressed the policy change did not entail an extension of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military umbrella to foreign-flag ships in regular convoys. Even under the new policy, only ships flying the American flag will be entitled to `` door-to-door protection'' in convoys. Also rejected in formulating the new policy were suggestions that <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> warships start protecting American-owned ships that fly a foreign flag of convenience, the sources said. Because of those decisions, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> hopes it can avoid the assignment of additional ships to the gulf to implement the new policy, the officials said. The new policy will extend in certain cases, however, to Western-operated oil rigs in the gulf, the sources said. The officials, citing the need `` to keep <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> guessing,'' refused to say when the administration intended to implement the new policy. One source said it could happen `` soon, maybe next week,'' but refused to elaborate. Another official suggested the timing could still be affected by on-going consultations with congressional leaders and with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies such as <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> that have their own warships in the region. <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> said specifics about the policy are classified. `` There is a decision in the sense that we know where we want to go now,'' said one official. `` But we're still consulting with some people and it's not in our interest to offer details to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.'' The change, which <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> and top aides began outlining on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> on Friday, is a result of the mining of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> frigate <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> April 14 and last Monday's extensive fighting between Iranian and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces, the officials said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces sank or crippled six Iranian vessels that challenged them after they destroyed two offshore platforms in retaliation for the mining of the Roberts. Top defense officials argued to the White House the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had to do more to deter <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> from sowing additional mine fields in the gulf, said the sources. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> further argued that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s response to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> strike on Monday `` was so utterly intemperate, just lashing out,'' that something had to be done, one official said. At one point Monday, Iranian gunboats began firing on oil rigs and Western ships in an oil field that had not been the scene of earlier fighting. According to the sources, the upcoming changes will not affect the so-called `` rules of engagement'' _ the guidelines given <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> commanders spelling out the conditions under which they may shoot; for example, the need for radio challenges and the range between forces.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> George </PERSON> is a gander in love, but the object of his affection is indifferent to his attentions and might not even notice if she stepped on him. <PERSON> George </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> goose, is hung up on a black cow named <LOCATION> Gracie </LOCATION> in an odd - couple courtship rivaling that of <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> the cow and her moose Farmer <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> first noticed the peculiar relationship during the goose mating season last year. `` There at the first last spring, I just figured old <PERSON> George </PERSON> had been out in the spring sun too long. I could n't help but notice how he would follow the cow everywhere she went,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. `` He even started sleeping with her.'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said he was the only one who noticed and did n't tell anyone else. <PERSON> George </PERSON> eventually came to his senses, but when he started up again earlier this spring <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> told his wife and daughter about the bird's bizarre love life. They thought it was a joke, but <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> told them to look for themselves. `` He just follows her around like that's his mate,'' said <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' daughter, <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON>, 20 <PERSON> George </PERSON> wants nothing to do with the rest of the large flock of geese on the farm and does n't show an interest in any other cow but <LOCATION> Gracie </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. `` And I would notice how old <PERSON> George </PERSON> would try to flirt and carry on with <LOCATION> Gracie </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` Why he would get right up in her face and make the strangest rackets you've ever heard, like he was trying to get the cow to come fly away with him.'' Ms. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said she does n't think <PERSON> George </PERSON> would try to hurt anyone who interfered, although the bird did charge a newspaper reporter who tried to get close enough to snap a photograph. `` When it started over this spring, he seemed bolder and more romantic than last year,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. <PERSON> George </PERSON> has been a member of the flock at <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' farm for about five years, Ms. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. She thinks he was hatched there, but it's hard to tell because the flock is large and gets mixed up with migrating geese making pit stops. <LOCATION> Gracie </LOCATION>, meanwhile, does n't take an active part in the relationship. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> calls all the shots and does all the flirting,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. `` <LOCATION> Gracie </LOCATION> just goes along to see what will happen next.'' <LOCATION> Gracie </LOCATION>'s attitude mirrors that of <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Hereford </ORGANIZATION> cow in <LOCATION> Shrewsbury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt. </LOCATION>, who was courted for 76 days from in the fall and winter of 1986-87 by a lovesick bull moose.

<HEAD>Restoration of Tropical Forests Could Slow Down `Greenhouse
Effect'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Major efforts to restore tropical forests could bring an important slowdown in the expected `` greenhouse effect'' warming of the earth, according to a study of forest needs. Growing trees absorb carbon dioxide, the principal gas responsible for the warming, and break the gas down to incorporate carbon in their woody tissues. A growing forest also adds carbon to the soil. `` It does provide an important lag time ... while we do important things in other areas, like re-orient national energy policies,'' said <PERSON> Lori </PERSON> <PERSON> Heise </PERSON>, a researcher at the <ORGANIZATION> Worldwatch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> and one of the authors of the study released Saturday. The institute is a Washington-based environmental research organization. It has frequently advocated increased conservation and use of renewable resources to replace fossil fuels. Carbon dioxide is released to the atmosphere in the burning of all fossil fuels. It warms the earth by trapping heat that normally would be radiated out to space. Most scientists believe the earth is warming, with potentially large changes in rainfall patterns, energy demand, crop-growing areas and a rising sea level to threaten low-lying areas. About 40 percent of the earth's land area, or 12.8 billion acres, is covered with forest, of which about 7.3 billion acres was tropical forest in 1980. The Worldwatch study estimates that about 3.2 million acres, an area the size of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, is lost every year. In their study of current tropical forest issues, <PERSON> Heise </PERSON> and co-author <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Postel </PERSON>, estimated that tropical countries need to restore about 250 million acres of forest to repair damage to soils and streams, 140 million acres to supply fuelwood and 25 million acres for timbering. Counting overlap and wood used for fuel in the near term, they estimated that about 300 million acres of new tropical forest could extract carbon dioxide from the atmosphere while the trees mature, which could be 30 or 40 years from planting. This would cover an area a bit smaller than <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. In an admitted `` back-of-the-envelope'' calculation, <PERSON> Postel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Heise </PERSON> estimated that the growing trees could remove 860 million tons of carbon from the atmosphere each year until the trees matured. This would be about 47 percent of the total carbon currently being released by forest destruction. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> Mintzer </PERSON>, a researcher for the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> who has studied the greenhouse effect, said the estimates of his counterpart organization `` are not trivial,'' amounting to about 15 percent of carbon released by all fossil fuel combustion. `` But we should not be seduced into thinking -LRB- reforestation -RRB- can solve the warming problem,'' he said. Slowing the destruction of tropical forests has the additional benefit of reducing emissions of methane, another greenhouse gas, <PERSON> Mintzer </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> agencies launched an effort in late 1985 to invest $ 8 billion, counting government and private investments, in reforestation over the next five years. The Worldwatch study said the success of the effort would depend on efforts individual countries make, and those in turn would depend on mobilizing international private organizations and foundations and local private groups. `` Indeed, what is needed in the coming decade is an effort somewhat akin to the agricultural Green Revolution of the sixties: a dedication to developing genetically improved tree species and to extending widely the technical and financial resources for reforestation,'' said the Worldwatch paper. To plant the forests they call for by the year 2000 would mean planting 17 billion trees per year, a massive undertaking, the researchers said.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> French </PERSON> no longer faces a first-degree rape charge, but the founder of a support program for spouse abusers says he still faces the trial of restoring his reputation. `` There always will be people out there scratching their heads, saying, ` He got off only because there was not enough proof,''' French said after the Grand Traverse County Prosecutor's Office dropped the charge last week. `` The accusation itself will remain a stain as long as I'm around.'' French, 43, was arrested in November 1986 and charged with first-degree criminal sexual conduct after allegedly assaulting a 39-year-old Traverse City woman the previous month. Assistant Prosecutor <PERSON> Arnie </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> said he dropped the charge because the woman refused to cooperate with prosecutors. She refused to comply with a court order requesting medical and psychological records, told her attorney she would not testify and finally indicated she wanted to `` drop the whole thing,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Zerafa </PERSON>, the woman's attorney, said she was not opposed to dropping the charge but said she was n't willing to disclose personal information. French said the accusation not only cost him thousands of dollars in lawyers' fees but also cost him an estimated $ 50,000 in revenue for the Time Out support program he started in September 1985, two years after he pleaded guilty to assaulting an ex-girlfriend. Referrals from local courts and community groups stopped after he was charged, French said. `` It's been pretty scary ... I was laboring under the misconception that a man was innocent until proven guilty, and I found in a lot of ways it is n't true,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> acknowledged Saturday he had many differences in his talks with General Secretary <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, but he tried to minimize the disagreements. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, speaking with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, had made a scathing attack on the `` sermons'' he said President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials had delivered about Soviet behavior. The Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, in a dispatch distributed Friday after <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> ended two days of talks in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, quoted <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as telling <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> that U.S.-Soviet relations `` are in need of a drastic restructuring.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> complained that `` everything that has been achieved in Soviet-American relations is being ascribed to the policy of strength and putting pressure on the Soviets.'' He accused <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials of constantly barraging their Soviet counterparts with `` demands, terms and grievances'' about human rights in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` We are not going to re-educate the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and do not recognize it has any right to re-educate us,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. The Soviet leader was most distressed with a speech in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, on Thursday in which <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> complained about Soviet aggression worldwide. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said that until it ended, `` the world can not know true peace.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, on a sightseeing tour of <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION>, the capital of the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>, said the superpowers have had `` lots of difficulties as well as lots of accomplishments.'' `` There have been some very tough parts to every meeting on both sides,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. `` He has things to say. I have things to say, and there are always some informative parts and there are positive parts.'' Later, flying from <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>, the capital of the Soviet republic of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials sought again to convince reporters that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s statement did not represent new strains with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. As if to underscore that the dialogue will continue, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, announced that <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> would meet with Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> May 11-12 to continue preparations for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s summit with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> May 29-June 2. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> called the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> account and stories based on it `` overblown,'' and he defended <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s tough rhetoric. `` I think perhaps there is an overreaction to the <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> speech,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. `` The president has always taken the view, that I agree with, that we have to state our views realistically all the time. And we have to act in terms of the things we think need to be done.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said he would keep stressing a need to improve human rights conditions in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Little progress was reported on the focus of <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s talks in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, negotiating a treaty to cut in half the superpowers' arsenals of strategic nuclear weapons <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> for sightseeing before heading Sunday for <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> to brief the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> on his <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> talks. In <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION>, the Ukrainian capital, he visited the site of a World War II German atrocity. `` We have to say to ourselves always, never again,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> declared in tribute to the 30,000 Jews and 70,000 other Ukrainians the German invaders herded into a ravine at <PERSON> Babi </PERSON> <PERSON> Yar </PERSON> and machine-gunned in September 1941. Stressing the heavy Jewish toll, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said, `` This was among the first places where we saw the holocaust and the slaughter of Jews.'' His visit fell on the Jewish Sabbath. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> laid a wreath at a monument the Soviets erected in 1976 and observed a minute of silence. The American envoy also visited an unfinished <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consulate in <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION>, the third largest city in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Construction of the mission has been halted and no date has been set for completion. American officials cite security concerns, a tighter budget and congressional opposition. But <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> favors opening the consulate for the wider knowledge it would bring of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` Our plan if we move ahead is to have what we call an unclassified post,'' staffed by five or six Americans, he said. The idea is not to have any sensitive material in the consulate and thereby not make it a target for Soviet eavesdropping.

 About 100 rescue workers combed the wreckage of a grain elevator complex today for two of three men missing after an explosion leveled the facility, while boats dragged a river alongside the granary for a third man, authorities said. Friday's explosion killed two other workers at the <ORGANIZATION> ADM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Growmark </ORGANIZATION> complex, and authorities said there was only a `` very small'' chance the three missing men were alive. Three others were injured in the fiery blasts. By morning, workers using bulldozers and cranes had cleared the site of about 50 percent of the twisted metal, chunks of concrete and piles of corn and soybeans left strewn over the site by the explosion, said an official at the disaster command post who would not identify himself. Dogs were used to sniff through the grain piles but had found no sign of the missing men. Workers remained cautiously hopeful today that they might still be alive, the official said. `` It would be very small, but yes of course, there is hope,'' he said. Authorities believe the two blasts, which leveled grain silos and an office building, may have been sparked by ignited grain dust. As many as six boats dragged the <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plaines </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> for the body of the third missing man, who was believed to have been thrown off a barge by the force of the explosions, and four divers searched downstream Friday, authorities said. Boats continued the search today, but winds and choppy water kept divers out of the water, authorities said. A gnarled life jacket was found in the river, but there was no sign of the missing man, <LOCATION> Romeoville </LOCATION> Fire Department Capt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> said. The fiery blasts likened by witnesses to results of dynamite or a tornado ripped through the <ORGANIZATION> ADM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Growmark </ORGANIZATION> complex along the river about 40 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> late Friday morning, officials said. Authorities identified the dead as <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Slatton </PERSON>, 28, of <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, 20, of Anchor. Both worked at the elevator, <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> part time while he studied agriculture at <ORGANIZATION> Joliet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Junior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. Joliet Police Sgt. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Saxon </PERSON> identified the missing as <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dupris </PERSON>, 23, of <PERSON> Bourbonnais </PERSON>, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON>, 18, of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Zack </PERSON>, 30, of <LOCATION> Joliet </LOCATION>. The explosions shattered windows in homes east of the elevator complex and sprayed grain and rubble, burying a tractor-trailer rig. `` I thought it sounded like a tornado or something,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Butterfield </PERSON>, 64, a <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION> farmer who witnessed the blast. `` I started running, but I was knocked down.'' He said he was rolling on the ground when he saw the four, 100-foot concrete silos falling. `` It was falling straight down like it had disintegrated,'' he said. `` It's gone, totaled, level complete _ just like dynamite.'' Authorities suspect grain dust may have caused the first explosion, which apparently ruptured a natural gas main about 11 a.m. and touched off a second blast moments later, said <LOCATION> Joliet </LOCATION> Fire Chief <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Plese </PERSON>. `` Fairly heavy levels of dust, almost like a dense fog,'' would have had to accumulate to set off such a powerful blast, said <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>, a safety manager with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Joliet </LOCATION> Fire Batallion Chief <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Colbert </PERSON> said the dust can be `` highly volatile, like petroleum.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Munchalfen </PERSON>, a security guard at the facility, said there had been four silos at the site, and only a sheet-metal covered grain dryer remained standing. One of the silos, each of which could hold about 100,000 bushels, crushed the adjacent one-story office building. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Contos </PERSON>, 26, of <LOCATION> Joliet </LOCATION>, a boat pilot working near the elevator site, said the second blast was `` just like a big ball of flame the whole length of the elevator.'' Two people were taken to <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joseph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. One of them, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Rayburn </PERSON>, 40, of <PERSON> Papineau </PERSON> was in fair condition, while the second man was released, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oudt </PERSON>.

 Not yet six months old, guidelines designed to produce uniformity in sentencing federal convicts are prompting widespread dissatisfaction among the judges who have to impose the prison terms. Judges are complaining about being turned into `` accountants,'' barred from using their judicial experience, discretion and intuition. `` My general reaction is that they're unwieldy and time-consuming,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballantine </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, Ky. He suggested the goal of the new rules, to make the punishment fit the crime, will not always be met. `` I question whether a fellow who goes into a bank intending to get $ 50,000 and comes away with $ 500 is any less culpable than the fellow who got the whole $ 50,000,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION> last month endorsed a challenge to the guidelines filed by a woman who must receive a 6 -LCB- - year sentence in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> for cocaine smuggling although she has no previous record There have also been other court challenges to the sentencing guidelines, with varying results, according to <ORGANIZATION> NACL </ORGANIZATION> officials. The guidelines are `` cold and implacable and as immutable as a computer,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ideman </PERSON>, a federal trial judge in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> who was one of 20 judges who met last week in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION> to discuss their concerns over the guidelines. But other judges among several interviewed by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> said there is enough leeway to suit the aims of justice. `` We could still go above or below the guidelines by citing the special circumstances of certain cases,'' said Judge <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Munson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> `` I'd like to see how it works first.'' Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, said his colleagues are `` virtually unanimous'' in believing the guidelines will need a major overhaul. <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judges </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said one problem is limits placed on use of probation. <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON> said probation works for the overwhelming majority of inmates who receive it as an alternative to doing time. Citing his own judicial district in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> as an example, <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON> said only 7 percent of those convicted criminals given probation since 1981 are accused of committing new crimes or violating their probation. `` This tells me that supervised probation makes social good sense because over 93 percent of these people are rehabilitated,'' he said. The probation system could yield savings nationwide for taxpayers of $ 2 billion a year, <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON> said, but he added that the system is threatened by the new sentencing guidelines. The guidelines, adopted under a federal law and applying to people convicted of crimes after Nov. 1, are expected to increase the prison population by 10 percent in the next decade. Federal prisons now hold more than 42,000 inmates, a 75 percent jump since 1980. The guidelines increase prison terms for robbery, fraud, forgery, drug violations and a host of other crimes. And for the first time, federal judges are required to impose prison terms for many white-collar criminals. For example, corporate executives convicted of antitrust offenses such as price-fixing must serve prison terms. Only 28 percent of those convicted of antitrust crimes were being sent to prison previously. Federal appeals court Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON>, who headed the commission that drew up the guidelines, said a main objective is to convince the public the criminal justice system is fair. `` There's a feeling in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that the white-collar criminal is able to steal with a pencil and get away with it while the 18-year-old kid who steals with a gun goes to prison for a long time,'' he says. `` There's something unfair and inequitable about that system. We're going to change it.'' But critics contend the new rules try to impose mathematical precision on cases that demand individual attention. There are 43 different categories for all federal crimes, and the length of a prison term is determined by the type of crime and the defendant's prior criminal record. Minimum and maximum penalties at each level do not vary more than 25 percent, and judges are barred from deviating unless the case involves factors not considered by the commission that drafted the guidelines. `` These guidelines have turned us almost into accountants,'' said a judge in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> who requested anonymity. `` I want to look a guy in the eye and say, ` I believe in you. I've looked hard at your case and I think you can make it.''' The guidelines also face a constitutional attack by federal public defender groups who say <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> improperly delegated legislative duties to a judicial body, the commission that drew up the guidelines. It is likely to take several years for that lawsuit to reach the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> for final resolution.

 The white marble headstone on <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikhalev </PERSON>'s grave is a reminder in this bastion of World War II valor that he died in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, but there is no monument to those who fought the war the Soviets did n't win. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s 115,000 troops are to begin the long-awaited march home this spring. And the nation must deal with the problem of how to remember those who served and those who died in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The human losses suffered since Soviet soldiers entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979 and the emotional wounds were unmentionable topics in 1981, when <PERSON> Mikhalev </PERSON>, 23, was buried in <LOCATION> Chizhukovskoye </LOCATION> cemetery among the heroes of World War II. The troops were sent in to defeat a revolt by anti-communists and leave behind an Afghan army capable of standing on its own. Neither goal was fulfilled, war weariness has set in and Soviets are now anxious for withdrawal. The Afghan war has left many returning soldiers deeply disturbed by their tour of duty in that Asian land. Drug addiction, a predilection for violence, apathy, disease, crippling wounds and broken marriages also are byproducts of the Afghan war. Significantly, the veterans are called `` the Afghans'' by many Soviets _ a clear sign, say many returning soldiers, that they are branded as outcasts. In few other cities is the contrast between the social status of Afghan veterans and those who struggled against the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> more apparent than in <LOCATION> Minsk </LOCATION>, a `` Hero City'' virtually destroyed in World War II and rebuilt as a monument to Soviet suffering and perseverance. Every major intersection and park has a war memorial or statue depicting a local hero. Here and in other cities, veterans of what is known as the Great Patriotic War proudly wear their medals and campaign ribbons. But not a single memorial has been erected in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to the soldiers killed in the 8-year-old Soviet military intervention in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The sole reminders are the stern young faces and bronze busts of young men staring from graveyards around the country. Few tombstones say the youths were killed in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, but all who pass by know the meaning of the inscription `` he died while fulfilling his internationalist duty.'' At <LOCATION> Chizhukovskoye </LOCATION> cemetery, the plaque on <PERSON> Vladislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivanovsky </PERSON>'s headstone is engraved with rare directness: `` Perished in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. An estimated 10,000 Soviets died in the war that was unmentionable until Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s drive for `` glasnost,'' or openness, made it acceptable conversation. The casualty estimates by Western sources pale in comparison with the 20 million Soviets killed during World War II. But grief is no easier for survivors of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> victims, and veterans from both conflicts acknowledge the problem goes deeper than numbers. `` It's been 40 years since World War II,'' <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuznetsov </PERSON> told an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> reporter at a recent meeting of Afghan vets in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` We are sometimes an uncomfortable reminder to those accustomed to peace.'' Soviets cling to the euphemisms used to label their activity in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, denying it was a war, contending they never sought victory, and always lowering their voices when the subject comes up. `` It can not be said that we went there to win. We went there to help,'' explained <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Maslov </PERSON>, a metal worker in <LOCATION> Minsk </LOCATION> who alongside his twin brother <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> served two years in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. `` The leadership of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> asked us to help.'' A tone of defensiveness permeates his discussion of the war. `` There is no reason to consider this a mistake,'' the 24-year-old veteran said, referring to the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s decision to send in troops. `` If it were necessary, we would do it again.'' The <PERSON> Maslov </PERSON> twins contend <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> veterans receive priority for housing and jobs. Yet each lives with his wife and child in a single room of a city dormitory. State-run media have come a long way in the past few years in acknowledging that Soviet soldiers were involved in combat and that there was resistance at home, from fearful mothers of draft-age boys to advisers at the top levels of power. The Soviets' experience in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> is similar to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers' service in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. But the Vietnam War was brought home to Americans daily through media coverage that focused as much on individual suffering as on the political issues involved. In contrast, Soviet media have carefully sanitized reports to cast the conflict as a `` situation around <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'' brought about by imperialist interference. Spurred on by glasnost, about 2,000 <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> veterans groups have sprung up around the country to talk to school children about their service, to help widows and mothers, and to talk over experiences they say outsiders do n't understand. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuznetsov </PERSON>'s group, which gathers on occasional Saturdays, has found a medium in song for issues most of the men find difficult to openly discuss. The mournful ballads about buddies killed in battle and the frustration of fighting a distant and little understood war have been collected and issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> recording company. One song reflects veterans' disillusionment, and a glimmer of the belief that Soviet involvement in a foreign civil war was pointless. In part, it says: `` They fight for the prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>, `` While we defend only our Soviet truck.'' `` The Return,'' a short documentary making its way into Soviet theaters, for the first time shows wounded soldiers and blown up tanks, and talks with troubled veterans and a bereaved mother. `` I'm a terrible enemy of this war,'' says a tearful <PERSON> Klavdia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ilyin </PERSON>, with a picture of her fallen son on a shelf in the background. `` I do n't see why our children are there.'' Newspapers have announced fund-raising campaigns to erect monuments to the `` soldier-internationalists,'' and articles in the national dailies have decried the second-class treatment of Afghan veterans by those who do n't want to be reminded of the war. `` Most people think our boys have been down there planting flowers and building roads,'' observed one World War II veteran in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` How can they earn the respect they deserve when so few know what they have done?''

 Democratic front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said Saturday he's not sure <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is even interested in the No. 2 spot on the Democratic ticket, adding that he and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> have `` one overriding goal'' _ a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> victory in November. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor continued to take shots at the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration on a variety of issues, testing themes for the fall campaign now that he has moved into a commanding position in the Democratic nomination fight. Foreign policy and Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s problems at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> were his targets for Saturday. `` I'm not here to beat up on the current administration _ they have have enough problems _ and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> especially these days, if there is a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told about 300 people at the old <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> Steel headquarters in the <LOCATION> Lehigh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaigned hard across <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> in preparation for Tuesday's primary. He also made a quick trip to <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, in advance of that state's May 3 balloting. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> faced each other in a second debate in as many days in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> Saturday night. At the <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> event, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was asked about <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s interest in the vice presidential nomination `` That is not what he said. I asked him if he were interested but he did n't tell me,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said of an exchange they had in the Friday night debate in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. `` As you could see last night, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> and I have a very good relationship. We respect each other,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` We happen to be very positive people. We both understand that there is one overriding goal in this campaign and that is to win in November.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has a big lead in the polls in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, which has a beauty contest primary and separate elections for national convention delegates. `` Every single primary is important. Please do n't pay any attention to the polls,'' he told the union members. `` We need a big turnout. Everybody has to vote. And you have to vote not only for me but for my delegates.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> began his day standing in front of the freighter Tradewind at dockside in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, talking of federal-local partnerships when music suddenly blared. `` What have we got here, a symphony behind me?'' said the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, turning toward the ship. Then he noticed the Greek flag being waved from the ship's bridge `` We're going to have a brief pause while we all appreciate this,'' which he said sounded like a <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> battle hymn from the Revolution fo 1821. `` This is too much.'' The Greek-American politician is a far more relaxed campaigner now that he has opened a big lead over <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. He mixes pleas for a big turnout Tuesday with themes that he would use as the party's nominee in the fall `` We're going to take back the presidency for the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and for the country in November. It's out there to be won. The people of this countryare ready for a change. You know and I know. We hear it every day,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told about 100 people at a <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> hall, his second stop Saturday morning. `` They want an Attorney General we can be proud of, not an <ORGANIZATION> Atorney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> we're embarrassed about.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> recalls his upset in the 1978 Democratic primary _ when he as the incumbent lost to a lesser-know conservative candidate after leading by 50 points in the polls. `` We were all looking at our statistics and we were n't remembering that it's out on the ballfield where you have to win that game,'' he said As he has in recent days since his major <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> vicory last Tuesday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> have emphasized the tone he wants to set in the campaign, a theme those who appear with him have adopted. `` He's going to take the high road all the way to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and all the way to the White House,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Borski </PERSON>, D-Pa., introducing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> at the union hall In particuarly, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> rejects any suggestion of criticism of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` It's important that we run a strong and positive campaign,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are interested in what I think of <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> or what he thinks of me. They want to know what kind of leadership we're going to provide for this country. They want to know whether I have the strenght, the values, the experience and and the ability to lead this country'' He has also been working on how to include his cousin <PERSON> Olympia </PERSON> _ who won an Oscar for best supporting actress two weeks ago _ in his stump speech. `` This has been an incredible two weeks for the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> family ... Who else but my cousin would hold up that <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> in front of a billion and half of people and say ` Okay, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> let's go.' `` That's our cry _ ` Let's go'.'' ~

<HEAD>U.S. Studies Chinese Comments on Iran Arms Embargo</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HENRY GOTTLIEB</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is studying the Chinese reaction to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attacks on Iranian targets in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> to see if <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> has reversed its willingness to go along with an arms embargo against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said Saturday. Winston Lord, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, informed <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities about the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision to retaliate against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for a mine explosion that damaged an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> warship, and discussed the issue with <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities, said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, speaking on condition of anonymity. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been pushing other <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> members to enact an arms embargo against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for refusing to accept a call by <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> for a truce in the 7 -LCB- - year-old Iran-Iraq war While lobbying for the embargo, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been seeking continuous reassurances from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> that it will not exercise its veto power if the rest of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> approves the ban. Chinese Foreign Minister <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> <PERSON> Xueqian </PERSON> said during a visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last month that his government thought the ban was a poor idea, but would not block it. In their latest comments, the Chinese repeated their view that an arms embargo would be a mistake and expressed concern that the clashes in the gulf are creating an improper atmosphere for <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>'s mediation efforts, the officials said. The Chinese did not say point blank they would veto an arms embargo, one official said. Nevertheless, he said, some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government experts believe the Chinese comments may represent a step away from their earlier vow of passivity. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s concern about an Iranian arms embargo is more than diplomatic. Its arms industry has sold billions of dollars of weapons to both sides in the Iran-Iraq war, notably Silkworm anti-ship missiles that have been fired at vessels in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. The officials noted that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s view on the arms embargo remains a moot point because the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> _ another member of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> _ has refused to go along at all. The latest refusal came on Friday during Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>' talks with Soviet leaders in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> `` You could argue it's not totally clear what the Chinese will do,'' one official said. `` But at this point it does n't seem to make much difference because the Soviets are still clearly opposed to the resolution.''

<DATELINE>CAMP DAVID, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Here is the text of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s weekly radio address, as delivered Saturday from his Camp David retreat: My fellow Americans, there's a memorable bit of dialogue between <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Raines </PERSON> and <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogart </PERSON> in the movie `` Casablanca. <PERSON> Raines </PERSON>, playing the <LOCATION> Vichy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> police inspector, asked <PERSON> Bogart </PERSON> why he came to <LOCATION> Casablanca </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Bogart </PERSON> says, `` It was for the waters.'' `` But this is the desert,'' replies <PERSON> Raines </PERSON>. `` There are no waters here.'' And <PERSON> Bogart </PERSON>, unflappable as ever responds, `` I was misinformed.'' Well, when it comes to the issue of trade, the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people have been misinformed. We seem to hear every night on the evening news that the trade deficit is looming over our economy, threatening at any moment to plunge us back into a second great depression. Well, I'm sorry to disappoint these doomcriers, but the economy is strong and getting stronger. What you do n't hear so often in the news is that the trade deficit has turned around. Exports are at record levels, factories are expanding, and more Americans have jobs than ever before in our history. Whether it's cars, steel, or high technology, the label `` Made in the <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>,'' is seen more and more around the world. This good news does n't get reported too much because the rising price of imports makes it seem like we're importing more. The truth is, when you account for price changes the trade deficit has decreased, and is now 20 percent smaller than it was during the third quarter of 1986. The fearmongers had their high day, or their hey day I should say, last October, when the stock market fell 508 points in one day of trading. Many blamed the merchandise trade deficit and predicted a dire future for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy. Depression, recession, catastrophe and calamity was all we heard. Well, I said at the time, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy was in great shape, and in fact in the six months since Black Monday, we've seen unemployment drop from 5.9 percent to 5.5 percent, the lowest since 1974. We've had six more months of real growth in the longest peacetime expansion in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history, and that growth has been impressive _ 4.8 percent during the last quarter of 1987. Some catastrophe. Not simply content with predicting disaster, some in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have put together legislation that would damage our ability to compete with our trading partners. Everyone talks about wanting a level playing field. But what <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would be doing is putting American workers and industries on the field with one hand tied behind their backs. They call this a trade bill, but there's a lot in it that has nothing to do with trade. Yes, I want a trade bill. And we've been working with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in good faith to produce a bill that would open markets and improve <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s competitiveness. But we must guard against enacting legislation that would reverse the gains of the past five years. The draft legislation does contain a number of important measures. It enhances our negotiating authority in the ongoing international trade talks, repeals the windfall profits tax, and creates a retraining program for workers who have been laid off. We strongly support these measures. But it also contains provisions that are unacceptable. I've made it very clear to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> I will veto this bill, and I'm confident that my veto will be sustained. Then I'll work vigorously to secure responsible trade legislation and urge the congressional leadership to schedule prompt action on the new bill. As long as I'm president, we're going to keep traveling the road we're on _ one of free and fair trade, record sustained growth, job creation, rising incomes and technological leadership into the 21st century. Now, I'd like to turn for a moment to events this past week in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. The actions that our forces took in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> were a measured response to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s resumption of mine-laying and continued aggression against nonbelligerents. We have completed these self-defense actions and consider this incident closed. I am extremely proud of the courage and resourcefulness of our military personnel in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. Their performance under very difficult circumstances has been superb. We're also very pleased with the role the European allies are playing in a cooperative effort to counter the Iranian mining threat and to help protect freedom of navigation. Such cooperative effort supported by our Gulf Arab friends offer the best means of deterring <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and enhancing Gulf security. Working together, we can also put new life into the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts to end the increasingly bloody, inhumane Iran-Iraq war, and remove the root cause of tensions in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. Our role in this war is neutral, and we do not seek to confront <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. However, its leaders must understand that continued military and terrorist attacks against nonbelligerents and refusal to negotiate an end to the war will be very costly to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and its people. Until next week, thanks for listening, and God bless you.

 Here is the text of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s weekly radio address, as delivered Saturday by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>: This is Senator <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> I have good news. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is one step closer to passing the long-awaited trade bill. Last Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> did its part. The trade bill passed overwhelmingly. Now, it is our turn in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Next week we are going to send the trade bill to the president for his signature. The trade deficit has got to come down. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s standard of living is being threatened. There are more of us working, but fewer of us owning homes. In most families, it takes two people working to keep the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream in sight. And everyone is looking over their shoulders, worried about the next crash on Wall Street. Year by year, we have slipped further into debt. The trade deficit, like the budget deficit, is in triple digits. The trade deficit is up again. That means fewer jobs for Americans. With this trade bill <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> will be telling the world: `` Watch out, you've got competition.'' We will be telling the world that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> expects fair competition: `` If you get access to our markets, we get access to yours.'' The trade bill is a positive step for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. It is a good bill. This bill creates programs for retraining workers, and gives the president new tools to open up markets to American products. It is not protectionist. The trade bill is comprehensive. It covers everything from exchange rates to better education for our children. The trade bill establishes a strong new export policy. At the same time, it protects American inventions from piracy by foreign firms. In addition, this trade bill prevents foreign investors from dominating industries vital to our national security. This trade bill is a reasonable response to a trade policy that hs gone awry. It opens up new markets, invests in people and ideas, and creates new opportunities for American industries and workers to work together _ to make <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> competitive again. We are at the 11th hour when it comes to dealing with our nation's trade deficit. This is no time to dilly-dally. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has got to get moving again. The trade bill gets us moving in the right direction. But all this is at risk if the president vetoes the trade bill. Despite months of working with the president, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is still unsure of his support. The president is still waving his veto pen in the air. The president is upset that the trade bill includes one small section to protect workers from suddenly being laid off without notice. That's the issue: the plant-closing legislation that you have been hearing about. Our bill says if your factory is going to close and you are going to lose your job, you have a right to know 60 days in advance. That is simple justice, simple decency. Right now, many workers get only a week or two or a day or two of warning that their jobs are about to disappear. About a third of all American workers get no notice at all. The administration does not like this provision. I think the administration is dead wrong. What they are saying is this: `` It is OK to give golden parachutes to the big guys, but it is not OK to give the little guy a warning that he is about to lose his job.'' Is that fair? Of course not. I have seen the impact of factories suddenly closing in my own state of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. Men and women who have loyally worked for years for a company suddenly are handed pink slips without warning. `` Go stand on the unemployment line. All your hard work does not count.'' That's the message. The choice is simple. If the president stands up for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, he will sign the trade bill. There will be no veto. It will be a great day. If the president vetoes the trade bill, he will be sending another message: The big boys with the golden parachutes count more than the little guy. Mr. President, at the 11th hour, do n't turn back the clock. We need new policies, not old politics. Mr. President, put away your veto pen and sign the trade bill when it comes to your desk.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> predicted Saturday that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will uphold his intended veto of a sweeping world trade bill expected to be sent to his desk in the coming week. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democratic leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, however, urged the president to sign the bill because `` it is no time to dillydally'' on the trade issue. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> exchanged views in the president's weekly radio address, delivered from Camp <PERSON> David </PERSON>, and the weekly <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> response to the presidential talk. `` Some in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have put together legislation that would damage our ability to compete with our trading partners,'' the president said. `` Everyone talks about wanting a level playing field, but what <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would be doing is putting American industries and workers on the field with one hand tied behind their backs.'' `` I have made it very clear to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that I will veto this bill and I am confident that my veto will be sustained,'' he said. `` Then I will work vigorously to secure responsible trade legislation and urge the congressional leadership to schedule prompt action on the new bill,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> told his radio audience, `` We are at the 11th hour when it comes to dealing with our nation's trade deficit. This is no time to dillydally.'' The majority leader took aim at <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s opposition to a provision in the bill that would require businesses with more than 100 employees to give 60 days' notice before closing a plant or instituting mass layoffs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> says this provision, supported by organized labor, would damage the competitive position of American business and cause the loss of American jobs. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, however, called the provision `` simple justice, simple decency.'' `` Right now, many workers get only a week or two or a day or two of warning that their jobs are about to disappear,'' he said. `` About a third of all American workers get no notice at all.'' `` If the president stands up for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, he will sign the trade bill,'' said <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>. `` If the president vetoes the trade bill he will be sending another message: the big boys with the golden parachutes count more than the little guy.'' `` Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, put away your veto pen and sign the trade bill when it comes to your desk,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> advised. It takes a two-thirds majority of both houses to pass a bill into law over a veto by the president. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed the measure 312-107 on Thursday. A vote in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is expected in mid-week. The bill would strengthen laws against foreign unfair trade practices, expand protection for workers who lose their jobs because of imports, give the president authority to negotiate a new global trade agreement and punish the <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and a Norwegian company for selling sensitive technology to the Soviets.

<TEXT>
 A pickup truck packed with <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION> exploded in a crowded vegetable market in this northern port city Saturday, killing 54 and wounding 125 in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s bloodiest such bombing in nearly three years. <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>'s eight hospitals and clinics were filled to capacity with victims of the 8:45 a.m. -LRB- 2:45 a.m. EDT -RRB- blast in the low-income <LOCATION> Tabbaneh </LOCATION> district. The explosion knocked down several buildings, gutted shops and set fire to dozens of cars. Police said the black Mercedes pickup was loaded with vegetables and rigged with an estimated 330 pounds of TNT. It went off as the area filled with midmorning shoppers on the seventh day of <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>'s holy month of <LOCATION> Ramadan </LOCATION>, when Moslems fast during daylight hours `` Tongues of fire shot up into the air and I felt the earth shaking under me. I fainted,'' said <PERSON> Ibtissam </PERSON> <PERSON> Khodor </PERSON>, a Moslem housewife who was shopping when the truck exploded. She spoke from her bed at <LOCATION> Nini </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. Nine-year-old <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Touni </PERSON> wept as medical attendants pulled a white sheet over the body of his 29-year-old mother at the Islamic hospital. `` My mother died. I have no mom,'' he cried. No group claimed responsibility for the bombing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s second-largest city, and police said they have no clues about who the bombers are or their motive Earlier car bombings have been blamed on the civil war between Syrian-backed Moslems and Israeli-backed Christians as well as other feuds involving Palestinians, Syrians and Israelis. <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> is 50 miles north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and has a predominantly Sunni Moslem population of 850,000. Saturday's explosion was the first major car bombing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this year. Acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, a Sunni, condemned it as a `` barbaric atrocity.'' `` All hands must team up to stop these executioners from committing further such crimes,'' he said. A police spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity according to regulations, said that `` several pedestrians and vendors were torn to pieces.'' He said Syrian troops in charge of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>'s security cordoned off the scene of the blast as ambulances with wailing sirens rushed victims to hospitals. Radio stations broadcast hospital appeals for urgent blood donations. Police said hospital morgues were `` packed with corpses, many of them burned or mutilated beyond identification.'' The car bomb was parked near a wall of a cemetery at the entrance to <PERSON> Tabbaneh </PERSON>'s vegetable market. Several shops were gutted and dozens of cars parked nearby were reduced to smoldering piles of twisted metal. Many buildings collapsed and civil defense teams dug through the rubble in search of trapped victims. Firemen doused the scene with water to extinguish fires touched off by the blast. Glass shards littered a 150-yard radius. Police said this was the worst car bombing since an explosive-laden vehicle exploded outside an ice cream parlor in <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> on June 29, 1985, killing 60 and wounding 100. Five people have been killed and 15 wounded in four relatively small bomb attacks in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> in the past three months. But there have been no car bombings. Last year 57 people were killed and 288 wounded in 16 car bomb explosions in various parts of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, according to <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> police reports. Car bombs are a byproduct of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 13-year-old civil war. More than 130,000 people have been killed since the conflict broke out in April 1975.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> warned <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s leaders Saturday that continued attacks on neutral countries and refusal to negotiate an end to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war `` will be very costly to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and its people.'' The president, in his weekly radio address delivered from Camp David, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, said, `` We do not seek to confront <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.'' But, he said, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s `` leaders must understand that continued military and terrorist attacks against non-belligerents and refusal to negotiate an end to the war will be very costly to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and its people.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s tough comments came a day after administration officials let it be known that under a new policy, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will allow <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> warships to assist neutral vessels under attack in the gulf. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, while remaining officially neutral in the 7 -LCB- - year-old Iran-Iraq war, has guarded American-flagged Kuwaiti tankers from attack since last summer But the escort policy was expanded to allow <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships to aid neutral merchant ships under attack after the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> frigate <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> struck a mine in the gulf on April 14. Under the old rules, which permitted retaliation only for attacks on American-flagged ships, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces retaliated last Monday, sinking or crippling six Iranian vessels that challenged them after the Americans destroyed two offshore platforms. `` The actions that our forces took in the gulf were a measured response to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s resumption of mine laying and continued aggression against non-belligerents,'' the president said. `` We have completed these self-defense actions and consider this incident closed.'' In a statement on the gulf Saturday, Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, D-Wis., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must face the issue of whether an intelligence failure was involved in the Iranian mine-laying incident `` <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s minelayers have clearly found a large hole in our procedures _ a hole large enough to drive at least two minefields through,'' he said. `` We have to assume, for planning purposes, that more minefields have already been laid, and we also have to assume that more minefields will now be laid.'' <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> had said earlier that he suspected the mines were not laid on orders from the <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> government, but by revolutionary malcontents. `` Regardless of who in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> ordered the minelaying, we are back to a state of confrontation,'' he said Saturday. The president, in his radio speech, said that he is `` extremely proud of the courage and resourcefulness of our military personnel in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. Their performance under very difficult circumstances has been superb. `` We are also very pleased with the role that the European allies are playing in a cooperative effort to counter the Iranian mining threat and to help protect freedom of navigation. Such cooperative efforts, supported by our gulf <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> friends, offer the best means of deterring <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and enhancing gulf security.'' `` Working together, we can also put new life into the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts to end the increasingly bloody, inhumane Iran-Iraq war and remove the root cause of tensions in the gulf,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Alabama May Be First State To Get `Survivable' Shelter For

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> has been chosen as the site for the nation's first survivable state emergency operating center, a disaster-proof shelter designed to allow state government to keep running even during a nuclear attack. `` Many EOC's date back to the 1950s,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> McAda </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're looking for a modern approach to civil defense. If funding is approved by the state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, the facility would provide safe haven for the governor and other top officials to direct evacuation procedures and other emergency operations during a nuclear attack. `` The population would be in disarray,'' said <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, director of the state <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. `` They would be confused and afraid. ... They would have confidence in those they have placed in high public office.'' The federal agency chose <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> to receive $ 1.1 million in funding to build the center, but only if <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> provides matching funds. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said the state was chosen based on its letter of intent guaranteeing the center would provide for the number of state officials and personnel needed to coordinate disaster operations and resources. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said recently that the facility has not yet been designed, but it would have to be a subterranean, windowless facility capable of accommodating as many as 270 members of state government `` necessary to ensure a return to normalcy.'' That would include the governor, top Cabinet officials, legislative leaders and judges. Walls several feet thick would protect inhabitants from radioactivity and a ventilation system would filter the air. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> would be dug to provide an adequate water supply for at least two weeks. `` It would not be the Grand Hotel,'' said <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, referring to an exclusive resort on Mobile Bay. `` It would provide food, clothing and shelter.'' More importantly, <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said, would be the center's state-of-the-art communications capability, including retractable antennas and equipment that would be functional even under radioactive conditions Such technology already is in place at federal facilities. `` During a nuclear exchange, the atmosphere would eliminate radio communications,'' he said. `` Our facility would be the national model of a communications system that can function regardless of the situation.'' In addition to a nuclear attack, the center could be used during hurricanes, tornadoes or any other natural or technological disaster, such as a crisis at the state's two nuclear power plants. <PERSON> McAda </PERSON> said most states have some kind of emergency operations center, but <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> determined in a recent study that their capabilities were `` low and declining.'' `` The continuity of government concept is one that <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> will be pursuing very vigorously in the future,'' said <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>.

 Many <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officers in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> eagerly had awaited the top-level policy change that now allows them to intervene in Iranian attacks on neutral merchant ships. Some expressed outrage in the past nine months over <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s gunboat attacks on unarmed shipping and their own inability to do anything about them `` It's like being a world-class athlete who's always ready for the event but never gets to participate,'' Cmdr. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> X. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rinn </PERSON>, skipper of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> frigate <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, said recently. The sweeping policy change may encounter strong objections in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Many lawmakers have opposed any step that could draw the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> into more confrontation with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which has been fighting neighboring <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> for seven and a half years. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Naval command in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> had no official reaction Saturday to the policy swing. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, who spoke on condition of anonymity, declined comment, saying it was a matter for discussion among high administration officials. But many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officers have privately made their feelings known in past months. Only two days before the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration announced the policy change Friday, a senior <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> commander described an incident in which he had to order one of his frigates to pull back from an Iranian attack on a non-U.S. flagged vessel. `` The captain knew the rules, but he really wanted to go after the Iranian,'' said the officer, who spoke privately. `` He asked for permission. I told him ` no, back off.' He was pretty unhappy. I had to say it twice.'' Such officers have spoken hopefully of a policy change that would enable them to bring their firepower to bear. `` If the Iranians were going to attack one of our convoys, they'd probably have done it by now,'' one senior officer said. `` But it's pretty discouraging to watch them attacking these other people and not be able to do anything to stop it.'' Under a policy in effect since July, when the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> began escorting 11 reflagged <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> oil tankers, American warships could defend only ships flying <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flags. The policy, included in so-called rules of engagement, allowed the warships to provide humanitarian aid to a non-U.S. flagged vessel in distress but only if the ship asked for it. They could not intervene against the attacker. Thus, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships bristling with weapons were forced to stand off while Iranian gunboats like the <LOCATION> Sabalan </LOCATION> _ the `` frigate Nasty'' as one Norwegian captain calls it _ blazed away at unarmed vessels with virtual impunity. The Sabalan, which usually goes for the crew quarters of its targets, was severely damaged by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bombs in clashes Monday. Indeed, the plan for a more active role in the gulf is a direct result of the mining of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> frigate and Monday's extensive fighting between Iranian and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces, administration officials said Friday. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces sank or crippled six Iranian vessels that challenged them after they destroyed two offshore platforms in retaliation for the mining of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vessel. The <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> officials stressed that the policy change does not mean the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> will assume a broader role escorting merchant ships. `` It's a random, target-of-opportunity approach, designed to throw the Iranians off guard,'' said one <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` This will give a lot of authority to local commanders and a lot of leeway to do as they see fit,'' said another. Some officers say hints of a policy shift had been in the wind for months. They speculated that the move came as a result of other high-level changes, including <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> replacing <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> as defense secretary. Rear Adm. <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernsen </PERSON>, former commander of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in the gulf, was reported last year to have been denied expanded operating authority. Some officers felt that Rear Adm. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> A </PERSON>. Less, a two-star admiral who replaced <PERSON> Bernsen </PERSON> in late February, was in a position _ if he wanted _ to argue the case anew with more clout. One senior officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he believed a policy reappraisal was necessary because the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presence had not effectively discouraged Iranian threats to international shipping. `` The <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> convoys have been a big success, but the gulf is still a dangerous place for any ships not under that kind of escort,'' he said.

<DATELINE>TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Politicians and diplomats say President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON>'s already weak government has been crippled because of its apparent inability to stand up to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Interviews with prominent Hondurans, as well as talks with foreign envoys and people in the street, indicated that citizens of this old friend of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are peeved with what they see as Yankee high-handedness. Local politicians said a series of events have prompted a fundamental review of U.S.-Honduran relations, which they said probably will change definitively, if not drastically. In recent days, Hondurans have bristled at the transportation of a Honduran national to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on cocaine charges, done even though the Honduran Constitution prohibts extradition of Honduran citizens. Many are angry about the use of Honduran territory by the U.S.-backed Contra rebels in their fight against the Nicarguan government. And the maneuvers of 3,200 American troops in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> last month were also seen by many as another example of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dominance. Even a presidential decision Monday to award a multimillion-dollar compensation to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen whose farm was expropriated in 1982 has incurred the people's wrath. `` Yankee garbage out of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>,'' and `` If the <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION> do n't get out, in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> they will die,'' about 2,000 people chanted as they marched in the capital Thursday The chants, which rhyme in Spanish, would have sounded foreign on so many voices just a few months ago. The march came two weeks after a mob sacked and burned the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Consulate. The demonstrators, like others, say <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON>'s submission to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wishes in recent months has reached the point where Honduran insitutions, including the Constitution, are blatantly ignored. Despite the ire of the students who made up the core of the marchers, most Hondurans are far from anti-American. Those consulted last week seemed especially hurt because the perceived slights are coming from a friend. `` <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> as an individual has no importance. He was just a detonator,'' said <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Acosta </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonilla </PERSON>, a lawyer and member of the directorate of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. He was referring to <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Matta </PERSON>, who was arrested April 5 and hustled out of the country and into the federal penetentiary in <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, by Honduran authorities working closely with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. <PERSON> Matta </PERSON>, considered an international cocaine kingpin, was one of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Druge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s most wanted men. `` If they can kidnap <PERSON> Matta </PERSON>, they can kidnap anybody's brother,'' said truck driver <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lezama </PERSON>. `` The servileness of this president has no name.'' `` There is complete indignation because of poor management of this -LRB- <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> -RRB- situation,'' said <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and a presidential hopeful for <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in fall 1989 elections. `` The image of <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> has been eroded,'' he said. But <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON> said he does n't think a military coup is possible. `` The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would cut off aid, and the economic situation here would go from bad to worse,'' he said. The armed forces governed <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> for nearly 20 years before a return to civilian rule in 1982. The military still continues to exercise much political power. <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> is one of the poorest countries in the hemisphere, with 50 percent unemployment or underemployment, 60 percent illiteracy and a per capita annual gross national product of just over $ 750. <PERSON> Gilberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> legislator, agreed that a coup was almost out of the question `` because everyone involved would lose.'' He said these are trying times for what had until a few months ago been an island of relative tranquility amid <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s turmoil `` But some good comes out of this,'' he said. `` It will make the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> realize its relations with <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> must be profoundly reanalyzed.'' According to <PERSON> Acosta </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonilla </PERSON>, `` It does n't matter that the small left takes up this banner of resentment. But it -LRB- the resentment -RRB- will consolidate the broader center-left for a revision of the status quo.'' <PERSON> Meza </PERSON> said the presidential candidate who taps into this resentment will have an advantage. `` Our presidential campaign is virtually underway,'' he said, `` and no one who hopes to win can fail to take this resentment into account.''

Capacity crowds of 3,000 screaming, cheering people showed up at the <ORGANIZATION> Evangel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> several nights last week to see the team, which is made up of former professional athletes who all are in their 20s. `` Tonight is for radicals only,'' <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> told one crowd. `` Men pushing their bodies to the limit. But most important, they love God. So, fasten your seat belts.'' <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, who weighs more than 300 pounds and has 21-inch biceps, showed his stuff by freeing himself from two pairs of handcuffs. Former <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> football star <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> <PERSON> Handley </PERSON> crashed chest-first through a stack of 2-by-4's. And former <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seahawks </ORGANIZATION> running back <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagen </PERSON>, who boasts of a 54-inch chest, crushed two 5-foot-thick slabs of ice with his triceps. Team members competed to see which one would be first to blow up a thick rubber hot-water bottle until it burst, bend a 1-inch steel rod between his teeth and then snap a baseball bat across his knees. `` Hollywood has always shown Christians as sissies,'' <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> said, `` but it takes more courage to live for God than anything else in the world. <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> was a real man.''

 A Greek cycling champion pedaled a fragile plane 74 miles over the <LOCATION> Aegean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> sea </LOCATION> Saturday and broke the world record for human-powered flight, but the aircraft was destroyed in a crash landing. A gust of wind snapped the tail boom off the ultralight <ORGANIZATION> Daedalus </ORGANIZATION> 88, which crashed into the sea just 10 yards short of the landing area on the island of <LOCATION> Santorini </LOCATION> 3 -LCB- hours after leaving the island of <LOCATION> Crete </LOCATION>. `` It happened in the last moments of the flight and the job was done. I did n't worry about it,'' the athlete-pilot, <PERSON> Kanellos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanellopoulos </PERSON>, told a news conference in the Greek capital. He was not injured in the crash. `` The situation in the landing area was too rough for this plane, which is built for calm conditions. I was under full control but the tail boom could n't take the pressure,'' said <PERSON> Kanellopoulos </PERSON>, who also broke the records for endurance and straight-line human-powered flight. <PERSON> Kanellopoulos </PERSON>, 31, Greek cycling champion for the past 14 years, was flown to <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> aboard an army helicopter shortly after the rough landing near the black sands of <LOCATION> Perissa </LOCATION> beach, on the southeast face of the volcanic island also known as Thira. The 72-pound graphite epoxy and mylar plane, designed by the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, fell after hitting a wind parallel to the beach, said <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION> professor <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Drela </PERSON>, who was in one of the boats following the flight. But <PERSON> Drela </PERSON>, the senior engineer responsible for the plane's aerodynamic design, said the project was `` definitely a success. More than 500 islanders and foreign tourists gathered along the beach to watch the plane, resembling oversized insect, glide towards the sand. The snapped tail boom caused the plane's huge 112-foot long wings to break, dropping the pink-and-silver aircraft 10 feet into the water. `` I was underwater so I forced my way through the cockpit and dove under the plane. Then I swam to shore,'' the tanned, blond cyclist said. <PERSON> Kanellopoulos </PERSON> pumped the pedals in the nose of the aircraft for 3 hours and 55 minutes to fly from <LOCATION> Heraklion </LOCATION> air base to <LOCATION> Santorini </LOCATION>. He lifted off at 7:06 a.m. -LRB- 12:30 a.m. EDT -RRB- and landed at 11:00 a.m. -LRB- 4 a.m. EDT -RRB-. The flight was intended to emulate the 3,500-year-old myth of <ORGANIZATION> Daedalus </ORGANIZATION>, a Greek architect, sculptor and engineer who flapped his way across the <LOCATION> Aegean </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Crete </LOCATION> on wings of feathers and wax. <ORGANIZATION> Daedalus </ORGANIZATION>' son, Icarus, flew too close to the sun, which melted the wax, causing him to to fall to his death. The previous world record for human-powered flight was set by the Light Eagle, a <ORGANIZATION> Daedalus </ORGANIZATION> 88 prototype piloted by <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Tremml </PERSON>, who flew 37.2 miles around <LOCATION> Edwards </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in January 1987. <PERSON> Kanellopoulos </PERSON> also shattered the record for straight-line human-powered flight set in 1979 by <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, who pedaled the Gossamer Albatross 22 -LCB- miles across the English Channel. The third record broken was for flight duration. The previous mark was held by <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, with a time of 2 hours, 49 minutes. Greek navy and coast guard vessels along with inflatable rescue craft had escorted the plane as it soared 15 feet above the <LOCATION> Aegean </LOCATION>. The flight came after a 36-member team of <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION> experts waited for three weeks on the wind-swept island of <LOCATION> Crete </LOCATION> for a suitable day to attempt the flight. Essential requirements were a calm sea, southerly winds of less than 3 knots, temperatures under 70 degress Fahrenheit and visibility to the horizon, according to <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bussolari </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION> aeronautics professor in charge of flight operations. `` Conditions for the flight were ideal. We even had a southerly tailwind,'' <PERSON> Bussolari </PERSON> said. The southerly tailwind pushed the <ORGANIZATION> Daedalus </ORGANIZATION> 88 over the Agean waters at a rate faster than expected by the <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION> team, with the plane averaging 18.5 miles per hour, team officials said. They had not expected the ungainly flying machine to go over 14 miles per hour. `` We were predicting the low speeds because we had been estimating headwinds, which are prevalent. We have no idea where the tailwinds came from,'' said project news director <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>. In addition to <PERSON> Kanellopoulos </PERSON>, three other athlete-pilots had been standing by for 48 hours each in readiness for a possible record flight. They were <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Scioscia </PERSON>, 27, of <LOCATION> Scranton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Zack </PERSON>, 26, of <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, and 27-year-old Tremml, the former world-record holder and a medical student from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Revolutionary Guards on Saturday retrieved remains of an American helicopter allegedly shot down by Iranian forces in a showdown with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> reported. The state-run broadcast, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said naval units of the Revolutionary Guards found the remains in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and brought them ashore. It said inspection proved the parts belonged `` to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Cobra helicopter which was shot by the Iranian forces and crashed in the gulf'' on Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> blasted two offshore Iranian oil platforms on Monday, touching off the most serious engagement with the Iranians since the American warships began escorting reflagged Kuwaiti tankers in the gulf last July. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> sank or seriously damaged two Iranian naval frigates and four smaller frigates, and fired on Iranian jets in the a clash. <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> helicopter with a two-man crew was missing in that confrontation. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said its forces shot it down. But that report has not been independently confirmed. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said the attack on the Iranian platforms was a `` measured response'' for a mine explosion that holed the American frigate <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> April 15, wounding 10 crew members. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> blamed <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for sowing mines in the gulf and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mine sweepers on Friday destroyed five such explosives. <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials said the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> examined the mines before they were detonated and found that they had been manufactured by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> warned <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s leaders that continued attacks on neutral countries and refusal to negotiate an end to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war `` will be very costly to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and its people.'' The president, in his weekly radio address delivered from Camp David, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, said, `` We do not seek to confront <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.'' On Friday, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials said that <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will now allow <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> warships to assist neutral vessels under attack in the gulf. Since last summer, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has protected 11 American-flagged Kuwaiti tankers from Iranian attack. But the escort policy was expanded to allow <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships to aid neutral merchant ships under attack after the <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> struck the mine April 14. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had avenged the <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> attack planned no more raids. `` We have completed these self-defense actions and consider this incident closed,'' he said.

 Ousted Panamanian President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> said in an interview broadcast Saturday that military strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> `` is not sound of mind'' and may want a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion of his country. `` Maybe he believes that -LRB- an invasion -RRB- will be an honorable way out,'' <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> said in a videotaped interview on <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Newsmaker Saturday.'' The network said the interview was taped Monday at an undisclosed location in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` He does n't know what he wants. He just want to hold off and prove that he can hold off an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> invasion. ... <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is not sound of mind,'' said <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, who called for either a Panamanian military uprising or an international military force to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, who tried to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as military commander two months ago and then was ousted himself by <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s Noriega-controlled legislature, said he would remain in the country He said he has been staying in the houses of six different Panamanian families. But <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, who is recognized as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s president by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, acknowledged little support in the streets of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> for toppling <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and called for people to sacrifice. `` We are sinking the ship to grab the captain,'' he said. `` We know that.'' <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> said Panamanians have not risen up against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> because they are afraid of him. `` They're terrorized. They've got beaten. They do n't dare go out to the streets and protest,'' he said. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who is accused in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> courts of drug trafficking, is backed by Cubans, Nicaraguans, the Colombia-based <ORGANIZATION> Medellin </ORGANIZATION> drug cartel and other <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> military officers who will have to be kicked out with him. The president-in-hiding said he doubted that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> would wage a guerrilla war if he is finally forced out of office, because he has n't got that kind of support and `` I think he's too rich to do any of that type of foolish action.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials allege that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has made millions of dollars by supporting illegal drug operations.

<HEAD>Guerrillas Threaten New Mayors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Leftist guerrillas battling the U.S.-backed government said Saturday they will prevent newly elected mayors from taking office and cited their recent assassination of one mayor. A message broadcast by the rebels' Radio Venceremos began with `` A call to all mayors'' in which the guerrillas said: `` The <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> will not permit you to exercise your functions. `` We warn that mayors will have to resign their posts or abandon their towns. We will be strict in enforcing this measure,'' the radio said. The <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> is the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, an alliance of five guerrilla groups waging an 8-year-old campaign against U.S.-backed forces. The radio referred to the April 15 slaying by guerrillas of <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Ventura </PERSON>, mayor-elect of the eastern town of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Isidro </LOCATION>. It said he was killed `` because he refused to withdraw. He had been warned.'' Ventura represented the rightist party <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>, which won two-thirds of the country's 262 mayoralties in March 20 legislative and municipal elections. The threat came a day after the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> admitted a writ filed by <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>, charging the incumbent <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> with fraud in counting votes for national legislators from the eastern province of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The court did not say when it would rule definitively. But it suspended certification of the disputed legislator from the province, which means <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> will have an outright majority when the new <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> is installed May 1. Arena has 30 seats assured in the 60-seat legislature, which because of the suspension will have only 59 members until the <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> case is resolved. The count disputed by <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> gave two of La Union's three legislators to the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>. Arena claims it won two of the three. The disputed count gave <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> a total of 30 deputies, the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> 23 and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conciliation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> seven. But until the case is resolved, the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, who have formed an informal alliance with the <ORGANIZATION> Conciliation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, will have 22 seats. An Arena-controlled legislature is expected to make President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s last year in office an uphill struggle. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> is a Christian Democrat.

<TEXT>
 French negotiators seeking to free three countrymen held by pro-Iranian extremists flew away empty-handed Saturday after last-minute hitches. The deal to free the hostages fell through because the kidnappers made last-minute demands that the French negotiators could not meet, according to Syrian and Lebanese officials at <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. Lebanese press reports said <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> officials had refused to pay ransom to the kidnappers. The government of Prime Minister <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> has been trying to free the three men before the first round of French presidential elections on Sunday. Such a release could boost the chances of <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, who is favored to oppose President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> in the final round of voting May 8. A chartered Swiss executive jet carrying the four French negotiators left <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> Saturday for an unknown destination, according to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> airport officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Radio monitors in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> reported they heard the pilot say he was heading for <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. The arrival of the 12-seat Falcon 50 in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, two hours earlier prompted speculation the release of the three Frenchmen was imminent and that the jet had come to pick them up. After a similar shuttle Friday, the plane's pilot, who would not give his name, told reporters at <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>: `` We went to get the hostages, but there were no hostages ready.'' The three hostages are diplomats <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Carton </PERSON> and journalist <PERSON> Jean-Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON> and Carton were kidnapped separately March 22, 1985, and <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON> was seized later that year on May 22. A fourth Frenchman, <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Seurat </PERSON>, a scientific researcher, was kidnapped with <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON> on May 22, 1985. Islamic Jihad, or Islamic holy war, which has claimed the abduction of all four, said on March 5, 1986, it had killed <PERSON> Seurat </PERSON>. <PERSON> Seurat </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Marie </PERSON>, says <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> officials have confirmed her husband died in captivity. Syrian and Lebanese officials said Friday the release of the three other Frenchmen was expected within hours. Dozens of journalists rushed to a night-long vigil at the Summerland Hotel in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, where two other French hostages were freed Nov. 27. <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian-run </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> said a <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> negotiator transmitted a new kidnappers' demand, which it did not detail, to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Friday evening. However, the station reported that the French government was divided and gave no answer. The conservative Ad-Diyar newspaper, based in <LOCATION> Christian </LOCATION> east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, said the kidnappers were demanding $ 28 million. It said <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> opposed the ransom, although it would be paid by French and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> businessmen. The other French hostages, <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Auque </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jean-Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Normandin </PERSON>, were freed in exchange for a French payment of $ 330 million on a $ 1 billion loan owned to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. It was made by the late <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON> and frozen by the French after the 1979 Islamic revolution in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The April 5 hijack of a <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> jetliner by <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> extremists also apparently delayed the release of Carton, <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON>, intelligence sources have said. In addition to the French captives, 18 other foreigners are missing in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. They are nine Americans, three Britons, a West German, an Italian, an Irishman, an Indian and two unidentified foreign men. The longest held is American <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>' chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

<TEXT>
 An underground preacher who spreads Christian gospel in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was arrested in a <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> park after he came to hear <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> evangelist <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, a religious rights activist said Saturday. <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yongzhe </PERSON>, from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s central <LOCATION> Henan </LOCATION> province, was detained April 16, one day before <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> preached to more than 1,500 people in a <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> church, said <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Chao </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> on Saturday as part of his two-week tour of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and could not immediately be reached for comment. <PERSON> Chao </PERSON> described <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> as an itinerant evangelist who trains his followers to conduct preaching services and establish new non-denominational churches. Since 1980, <PERSON> Xu </PERSON>'s team of evangelists has established more than 3,000 local churches that are loosely associated, <PERSON> Chao </PERSON> said. His claim could not be independently verified. <PERSON> Chao </PERSON>'s center is known in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> for having critical views of the Chinese government. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> permits freedom of religion but religious activity is closely monitored by the state. Proselytizing to the general public is banned, but preaching in the state churches is allowed. There are 4,000 state-sanctioned churches in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The official <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, which split with the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> in the 1950s, claims more than 3 million members throughout <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. An unknown number of other Chinese remain loyal to the pope. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> also says it has several million Protestants. Xu worked outside the state-sanctioned churches because if he worked with the state he would have been `` forbidden to expand the Christian faith by preaching,'' <PERSON> Chao </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Chao </PERSON> said <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> was arrested in 1982 for preaching and was put in a detention center for several years. Xu has since worked clandestinely in the countryside of central <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> spreading the gospel, <PERSON> Chao </PERSON> claimed. <PERSON> Chao </PERSON> said he was informed of <PERSON> Xu </PERSON>'s arrest in a letter dated April 20 from reliable Christian sources inside <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. There was no way to independently confirm the information and authorities in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> were unavailable for comment this afternoon. According to the four-page letter, <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> told a friend in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> that he would come to the capital to see <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>. <PERSON> Chao </PERSON> believes the letter was intercepted by authorities. <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on April 13 and was arrested three days later while walking in <LOCATION> Yuetan </LOCATION> park with friends, the letter says. `` He was arrested because he wanted to hear <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> preach,'' said <PERSON> Chao </PERSON>. <PERSON> Chao </PERSON> said he had no further updates on <PERSON> Xu </PERSON>'s situation. <PERSON> Chao </PERSON> said his center publishes a weekly news report and a monthly magazine about religion in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. He described himself as being critical of the religious policies of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> which he said persecutes itinerant preachers.

That would strengthen the position of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>, who won office in December with just 36 percent of the vote. Police said `` all available police forces'' were mobilized to watch 148 campaign rallies Saturday. The Korean news agency, <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION>, reported the rallies were largely peaceful because of the heavy security. At some rallies, police in full riot gear lined up three or four deep along one side of the podium. A dozen people were injured overnight when students armed with firebombs attacked a governing party office in the southern city of <LOCATION> Chonju </LOCATION> and a nearby police station. In the central city of <LOCATION> Taejon </LOCATION>, a campaign minibus covered with opposition party posters was set on fire overnight, and gangs attacked opposition party supporters in some rural areas on Saturday. Once again, the opposition is split and the surveys showed governing party candidates leading for more than 90 of the seats being decided in 224 districts. Seventy-five other seats are being decided by nationwide vote proportions, with the leading party predicted to win 38 of them. The last assembly had 276 seats, with 160 held by the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. In Tuesday's voting, 1,045 candidates are competing for the 224 district seats. The winners will serve for four years, compared with a five-year term for the president, who is limited to one term. In a news conference Saturday, opposition leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON> contended that `` our country will enter a gloomy period if the ruling party, controlled by tycoons, generals and corrupt bureaucrats, wins a majority.'' Rival opposition leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> warned that the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> government would face popular outbursts if it continued the allegedly improper campaigning. In December, both <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON> insisted on running for president, splitting the opposition vote. Under a new constitution that took effect in February, the assembly has greater powers to investigate government actions, and the president no longer can dissolve the legislature.

 French voters enjoyed a lull Saturday on the eve of elections expected to determine who eventually faces off with President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, a Socialist acting like a social institution these days. Since the hectic two-week official campaign ended Friday, the silence has been resounding. No media appearances or campaigning were allowed on Saturday. Even the political grease of voter surveys had run dry. French law prohibits polls in the week before the elections. Even so, voters had plenty to spin their wheels over. The confrontation marks the first time in the 30 years of the Fifth Republic that a president and his own premier have faced one another in a presidential election. All polls predict that <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, the 71-year-old president seeking a second seven-year term, will square off in the May 8 runoff with <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s 55-year-old conservative premier. They have `` cohabitated,'' as the French put it, since the right's victory in parliamentary elections in 1986. The main interest in Sunday's voting, then, was reduced to numbers: _ What percentage will <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> win? Will he be able to pick up enough Communist and centrist votes to expand the 35-37 percent the polls give him? _ What will be the combined totals of <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, predicted to gain 22-24 percent, and former center-right premier <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Barre </PERSON>, 16-17 percent? That number could give a good idea whether anyone can beat <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> in the final round of voting. Besides <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, 68-year-old <PERSON> Barre </PERSON> is the only other candidate with a whisper of a chance to make it to the runoff. He was long the top rightist candidate before nose-diving in the polls in the past two months. <PERSON> Barre </PERSON> has said he ca n't be counted out now. But he pledges to support <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> if the premier comes out ahead in first-round voting. <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> has vowed to do the same. Much also depends on backers of extreme right <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Jean-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON>'s strident anti-immigration and `` French first'' appeal has won over an estimated 10-12 percent of the electorate in an otherwise lackluster campaign. Actually, voters will choose from nine candidates Sunday. Theoretically, it is possible to elect a president in the first round, but the large number of candidates means that no one can expect to win the required absolute majority of votes. Other candidates in the race are <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Lajoinie </PERSON>, the official <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> candidate; <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Juquin </PERSON>, leader of a splinter <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> reformist movement; ecologist <PERSON> Antoine </PERSON> <PERSON> Waechter </PERSON>; <ORGANIZATION> Trotskyist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arlette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laguiller </ORGANIZATION>; and another Trotskyist, <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Boussel </PERSON>. The polls predict <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> will win the runoff no matter who he faces. He has reshaped his image toward the center in recent months and has even been dubbed by the French with the avuncular nickname of `` Tonton.'' But <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> was closing the gap when the final surveys were published a week ago. Moreoever, the undecided vote was high, as much as 20 percent. Many political analysts say <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> must get 35 percent in the first round in order to win May 8. On the right, it was generally thought that the combined Chirac-Barre vote must total at least 43 percent to give conservatives a chance in the runoff. However, many of <PERSON> Barre </PERSON>'s more centrist supporters may abandon <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> in the second round. The polls open 8 a.m. Sunday and close in most areas at 6 p.m. In major urban areas, however, they remain open until 8 p.m. None of the candidates has come out with a detailed program, focusing instead on generalities. In his last television speech, <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> stressed the need for `` solidarity, equality of opportunity'' and the `` refusal of privileges'' for some people. <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> has responded by accusing <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> of `` proposing nothing precise for our country.'' He stands on his two-year record as head of the government, which he says started the country on the road back to prosperity.

 Twenty-five years of romance, turmoil, romance, treachery, romance, mystery and more romance were toasted by past and present stars of `` General Hospital'' at a black-tie gala befitting the top-rated daytime drama. The <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> soap, which debuted April 1, 1963, placed No. 1 again in the most recent Nielsen ratings, but one of its original stars, speaking at Friday night's party at the Ambassador Hotel, recalled its humble beginnings. `` When we started, I did n't think we were going to last 25 minutes let alone 25 years. It was very iffy,'' said <PERSON> Emily </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON>, who as nurse <PERSON> Jessie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON> is one of two original cast members still with the show. `` We hit No. 1 in 1968, and then we went down so far we were almost canceled.'' `` We had a wonderful time,'' recalled actor <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Betts </PERSON>, who was on `` General Hospital'' during its first three years. `` -LRB- Actor -RRB- <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Beradino </PERSON> had been a ball player and had never done a soap before. Nor had I. We never thought it would last, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> kept saying he'd have to go back and play baseball again.'' <PERSON> Betts </PERSON>' character was written out of the show when he was sent to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to do medical research and never came back. `` General Hospital'' has been consistently first in the daytime ratings, although it's locked in a tight race with <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` The Young and the Restless.'' The show has been a huge success throughout the 1980s. Nevertheless, `` General Hospital'' was on the brink of cancellation 10 years ago, before <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Monty </PERSON> became executive producer and turned the show around. The show became a pop phenomenon, led by anti-hero <PERSON> Luke </PERSON> and the headstrong <PERSON> Laura </PERSON>, a tainted <PERSON> Romeo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Juliet </PERSON> involved in murder, rape and other shady activities. Their wedding in 1981 sent the ratings jumping off the chart, with <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> as a guest star for the wedding sequence. Although <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Geary </PERSON> and <PERSON> Genie </PERSON> <PERSON> Francis </PERSON>, who played the lovers, have left, there are enough plot twists and offbeat characters to keep the audience happy. <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Monty </PERSON> has also left and been replaced by <PERSON> Wes </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenney </PERSON>. <PERSON> Beradino </PERSON>, as Dr. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON>, and Ms. <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> have been with the show since the beginning. <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ames </PERSON> as the oft-married <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON>, who finally settled down with her longtime love, joined soon afterward. Former stars include actors who built careers on prime time, like <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stamos </PERSON>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Groh </PERSON>, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Travanti </PERSON>, <PERSON> Emma </PERSON> <PERSON> Samms </PERSON>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON>, as well as film stars <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamill </PERSON> and <PERSON> Demi </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Twenty-Year-Old Murder Case Ends With Conviction</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Two murder cases, one of them 20 years old, have been closed with the conviction of a man police considered a suspect from the beginning and whose arrest was sparked by a national television program. To the women who knew him, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Weeks </PERSON> was a <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gable </PERSON> lookalike. But authorities say he was a man whose jealous rages led to the deaths of two women and most likely a third. Weeks was convicted Friday in the 1968 murder of his ex-wife and the 1980 murder of a former girlfriend. The jury recommended that he spend the rest of his life in prison without the possibility of parole. `` I believe <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Weeks </PERSON> is finally history,'' said deputy district attorney <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON>. Authorities had considered him the prime suspect in the killing of his ex-wife, <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Weeks </PERSON>, right from the beginning. He also was convicted in the killing of <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Jabour </PERSON>, and police believe he also killed a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> woman, <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON>. All three women vanished after agreeing to meet Weeks for dinner. All three had told him just before they disappeared that they were ending their relationship with him. Ironically, it was Weeks' latest girlfriend, a <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, free-lance writer, who turned him in last year after seeing the television program `` Unsolved Mysteries'' and recognizing Weeks as the man suspected of killing the women. None of the bodies was ever found, forcing prosecutors to put together a painstaking case of circumstantial evidence. `` Generally in a murder case you've got a body and you put on a medical examiner and he explains the cause of death,'' said <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON>. `` We did n't have a body so we could n't do that.'' Instead, <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON> put on members of the victims' families, former neighbors, doctors, anyone he could find with a connection to the victims and Weeks. In all, 52 witnesses were called during a 3-week-long trial. Many of the witnesses remembered Weeks as very much a ladies' man, with a pencil-thin mustache and dark hair that made him resemble <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gable </PERSON> `` We had to put on a whole lot of people so we could make it crystal clear that these disappearances could n't be voluntary,'' said <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON>. Relatives testified that Mrs. Weeks would never have voluntarily left her four young children. A friend testified of seeing Mrs. Weeks for the last time when she got a threatening phone call from Weeks 15 days after their divorce. The friend said he confronted Weeks after the woman's disappearance and that Weeks matter-of-factly replied, `` She either had a nervous breakdown or is probably dead. A doctor testified about treating Mrs. Weeks several times for bruises that she suffered at Weeks' hands. A friend of Miss <PERSON> Jabour </PERSON> testified that the real estate broker would never have gone off without her valued clothes or a $ 47,000 securities account. And the father of Miss <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> recalled his daughter telling him she owed Weeks one last dinner, at which she was going to tell him of her engagement to a <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> doctor. `` The real challenging part of the case was <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Weeks </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON>. `` We had to go back years with family members who have done their best to block out the memory. And the other people just did n't care that much about it.'' <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON> has a theory about the fate of the victims. `` This fellow had a lot of interest in mining, he knew where mineshafts were,'' the prosecutor said. `` If we knew where these mineshafts were I think we'd find the remains of <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Weeks </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Jabour </PERSON>.''

 Emotions boiled over with violence as vendors failed to stop state lawmakers from selecting the place where the vendors work as the site for a convention center. Several scuffles broke out as about 100 vendors, mostly immigrants from <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, surged from a Capitol meeting room, trying to confront the lawmakers who were quickly escorted out by security officers. Ten <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> police officers were dispatched to help a dozen security officers quiet the crowd in the Capitol late Friday night. One Korean woman collapsed, apparently from emotion. `` No, No, No,'' went up the shouts as <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Holt </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tourism </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Romy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cachola </PERSON> announced agreement on the International Market Place in <LOCATION> Waikiki </LOCATION> as site for the convention center. Some called the lawmakers `` traitors,'' while others made death threats. Women wailed and sobbed uncontrollably as others grabbed and restrained several young men who attempted to chase the lawmakers. Tension had been building throughout the evening as the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> conferees exchanged proposals and then recessed for lengthy periods. Vendors have been staging rallies at the Capitol since February and have attended every hearing to testify on the convention center issue. `` I've been here 18 years and we've had all kinds of people here as lobbyists, but this is the first time I went through this kind of experience,'' said <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Kihano </PERSON>. `` I just hope they -LRB- vendors -RRB- understand that the people who intend to develop the market place are putting up a lot of money to take care of their problems, to relocate them,'' said <PERSON> Kihano </PERSON>. <PERSON> Won </PERSON> <PERSON> Hee </PERSON> <PERSON> You </PERSON>, who has served as a spokeswoman for the 900 vendors, said they fear the convention center will wipe out years of work to establish their businesses. The measure will allow a private developer to exceed the city's 280-foot height limit on the five-acre parcel and put up three 400-foot hotel and condominium towers In exchange for the additional height, the developer has agreed to build a 625,000 square-foot convention center facility which would be turned over to the state. Such a facility would cost the state $ 150 million to $ 200 million to build, according to <LOCATION> Cachola </LOCATION>.

 When an assassination team gunned down the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s No. 2 man at his villa in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, it was widely accepted as another daring action by the long arm of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s fabled security and intelligence services. The slaying of <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON> 1,500 miles from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on April 16 bore the fingerprints of the Mossad, the agency responsible for activities outside <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s borders. By all accounts it was quick, decisive, carried out with split-second timing and backed by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s air and naval forces. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s intelligence has been able to gather precise information on locations of homes or installations and the movements of bodyguards. Teams have been able to make pinpoint attacks and often escape without detection. Although Israeli officials declined public comment, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> sources privately acknowledged the killing was planned by the agency, approved by the government and carried out by elite Israeli commandos. <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> accused <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> of carrying out the assassination. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s intelligence services have planted an agent in <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, found and kidnapped Nazi war criminal <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Eichmann </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> in 1960, participated in the dramatic rescue of Israeli hostages held at <LOCATION> Entebbe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION> in 1976 and the bombing of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s nuclear reactor in 1981 The Mossad has earned a reputation for carrying out imaginative, high-risk operations to rescue Israeli captives or punish those believed responsible for planning and carrying out attacks against Israelis. `` Because of our special circumstances _ namely we are poor, small and surrounded by belligerent countries _ the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> intelligence is of utmost importance,'' said <PERSON> Meir </PERSON> <PERSON> Amit </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Mossad </ORGANIZATION> from 1963 to 1968. `` We have to have ears and eyes beyond our borders.'' `` If you can bang in the nail in one hit instead of two, you save money and energy. But to do that, you have to know where the head of the nail is,'' <PERSON> Amit </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` That's where the Mossad comes in. Despite some public failures, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> intelligence has been effective, and the <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON> operation fits the pattern. <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>, 52, also known as <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jihad </PERSON>, was deputy to <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and head of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s military operations The Italian news agency <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION> quoted Italian military officials, who it did not identify, as saying a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 707 reportedly involved in the raid may have passed through international air space under direction of Italian air traffic controllers. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s air traffic control center confirmed to The AP that it tracked an Israeli plane identifying itself as a civilian aircraft shortly before the commando attack at <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>'s house on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>. Israelis say <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON> organized a 1978 bus hijacking in which 35 Israelis were killed and a <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> hotel takeover in 1975 in which 11 hostages were slain. More recently, Israelis contend he was the mastermind behind nearly five months of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> unrest as well as two successful guerrilla infiltrations in which nine Israelis were killed. Founded in 1951, the agency is responsible for covert activities outside the country, as is the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>. Unlike the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, however, the Israeli organization is so secret that <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> law bars publishing the name of the current <ORGANIZATION> Mossad </ORGANIZATION> chief. The agency is viewed as key to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s survival. The agency is helped by the fact that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, because it is a nation of emigrants, has among its ranks Jews born in Arab countries who speak Arabic and can easily fit into enemy environments. <PERSON> Eli </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, the legendary <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> spy who developed close friendships with Syrian government and military leaders, is a classic example. The Egyptian-born <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, posing as an Arab, provided <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> with critical information from 1960 until 1965, when he was unmasked, tortured and hanged by the Syrians. In addition, many Jews who do not live in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> feel a sense of loyalty to the Jewish state. In 1966, the <ORGANIZATION> Mossad </ORGANIZATION> used an American woman to persuade an Iraqi fighter pilot to defect to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> with his Soviet-built MiG-21 fighter sought by Israeli military intelligence. Mossad agents also were led to <PERSON> Eichmann </PERSON> by a tip from a German official who was Jewish. Although few details have yet emerged, the <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON> killing appears to bear the most similarity to the 1973 raid on <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> offices in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in which three top <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials, including <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>'s predecessor <PERSON> Kamel </PERSON> <PERSON> Adwan </PERSON>, were killed As in the Wazir killing, that operation involved seaborne commandos who managed to carry out the killings on enemy territory despite the presence of armed guards. The leader of that earlier raid was Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Amnon </PERSON> <PERSON> Shahak </PERSON>, now the head of military intelligence who reportedly helped organize the Wazir killing. Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Ehud </PERSON> <PERSON> Barak </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s deputy chief of staff, planned the 1973 raid. According to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> sources, <PERSON> Barak </PERSON> was the officer who personally saw off the commandos who went to <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> to gun down <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> also had experience making the long trip to <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> over the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. In 1985 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> bombed <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>, reportedly killing 50 people including an <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> bodyguard. There have been some failures. The Mossad was criticized for failing to adequately warn <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders of an Arab military build-up prior to the 1973 Yom Kippur War. In addition, Israeli agents killed the wrong man in July 1973 in their hunt for an Arab guerrilla in <LOCATION> Lillehammer </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>. The 1972 Ben-Gurion Airport massacre, in which <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas killed 26 people and wounded 72 in the Israeli passenger terminal, was a serious security lapse. <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>'s killing was approved by key government ministers, according to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> sources. But two, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ezer </PERSON> <PERSON> Weizman </PERSON>, a Cabinet minister without portfolio, publicly expressed displeasure with the assassination, fearing it could kill U.S.-backed peace efforts and fuel greater Arab extremism. `` At the very time that Israeli leaders are primarily concerned with calming the territories, the elimination of <LOCATION> Abu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jihad </LOCATION> is like tossing an enormous amount of fuel on the flames,'' wrote the daily Hadashot. `` Moreover, if the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leaders are to be eliminated, with whom then do we intend to discuss the issue of settling the Palestinian problem?'' Many Israelis, however, feel <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>'s assassination provided some long-awaited good news. `` Whether or not <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> did it, there is no question that we had not only the right, but the obligation to kill people like <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jihad </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Landau </PERSON>, a legislator from the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc. `` Such a success in our fight against terrorism can not help but be met here with praise and enthusiasm.''

 A pregnant woman shopping at a video store with her children was shot to death before their eyes during a holdup, but the unborn child she carried was alive Saturday following a Caesarean section delivery.

Mrs. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, 31, of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, died about 30 minutes after the unprovoked shooting at the Voyager Video store, where she was shopping with her three children.

She remained in critical condition Saturday, a nursing supervisor said. Witnesses told police the man fled in a large, older model car, although no one actually saw him get into it. The amount of cash taken in the robbery was undetermined. In addition to the victim's children, whose ages ranged from 5 to 13, and the clerk, about eight other people witnessed the shooting.

 Israeli troops enforced a tight curfew Saturday on 400,000 Arabs during a `` Day of Rage'' ordered by Palestinian leaders. An Israeli policeman shot and killed a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> man who attacked him with an ax. The curfew, confining Palestinians in the occupied territories to their homes, was maintained for a sixth straight day following violent protests over the assassination of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> military leader <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>. Two Palestinians were shot to death by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops during the protests Friday in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. A paramilitary border policeman shot and killed a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> man who attacked him with an ax during a protest in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Qabatiya </LOCATION>, the army said without identifying the dead man. <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said the demonstration in the village 43 miles north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> was to protest <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>'s slaying. The army said dozens of Palestinians participated. In <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, some 200 youths, many masking their faces with their Arab headdresses, hurled rocks at troops in the Aida refugee camp. An <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter saw soldiers fire tear gas and rubber bullets at the protesters. Witnesses said a 7-year-old Arab boy was injured by rubber bullets and nine residents suffered from tear gas inhalation. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>'s Maghazi refugee camp, troops arrested two Arabs after a firebomb was thrown at an army patrol, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> said. No injuries were reported. The death on Saturday brought to 172 the number of Arabs killed since the uprising began 19 weeks ago. An Israeli teen-ager and an army soldier also have perished. Underground leaders of the Palestinian uprising had called for a `` Day of Rage'' in the occupied territories Saturday to mark a week since <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>'s death. In <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, burning tires filled the air with smoke. Most shops were closed in response to a call for a general strike. But vendors sold fruits, vegetables and other goods from carts on the streets. The army curfew Saturday covered the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> towns of <LOCATION> Anabta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, population 100,000, along with 20 refugee camps in the former <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> territory. The army said it would lift on Sunday a four-day-old ban on travel to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> by residents of the occupied lands. Israeli leaders had predicted that the uprising against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 21-year occupation would falter both because of strong army action and economic strains on the Palestinians caused by repeated general strikes Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 40th anniversary Thursday that he believed violence would end soon in the occupied territories. An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> scholar said Saturday, however, that <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>'s assassination, which has been blamed on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, could prompt more bloodshed `` We may see more terrorist operations not only against Israeli targets in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> itself,'' <PERSON> Asher </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Tel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviv </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>. `` There may be more terrorist operations against Israeli objectives in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> which <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> at least has abstained from for quite a few years.'' <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>, a terrorism expert, said that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> group may see the killing of <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON> `` as a change of the rules in the war with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, that they would now be able to justify operations against Israeli targets in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>, a close associate of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, was slain at his home in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, on April 16. Tunisian authorities and informed <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> sources have said the assassination was carried out by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> commandos. Israeli officials have said that <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON> directed much of the uprising in the occupied territories, but <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON> said he doubted <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>'s death would cause either a sudden outburst of violence or an end to the uprising. `` I think it should be recognized that the uprising in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> was not a PLO-organized phenomena,'' he said. `` Although the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> certainly supported and encouraged the uprising, it was not totally controlled or initiated by the organization.''

 Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> travels Monday to <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, a city unhappy with the time he's taking to make a decision affecting thousands of jobs and millions of dollars in newspaper revenues. At his office, the embattled attorney general faces a desk piled high with other policy questions, ranging from an intramural dispute between the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to initiatives on drugs, pornography, gun control and the death penalty. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s chief spokesman, <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastland </PERSON>, says `` the attorney general has indicated to anyone that has asked him that he is moving as quickly as possible to make decisions on issues that rise to his level.'' But congressional critics pressing for <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s resignation suggest the tangle of ethical questions over his conduct and staffing problems at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> are hindering his ability to tend to regular business. `` I do n't know how decisions can be made in a timely way in the environment that he faces, where senior staff has quit,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Democrat whose Governmental Affairs subcommittee has held extensive hearings into <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s affairs. <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> is focusing on <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s statutory authority to decide whether the city's two daily newspapers, the News and the Free Press, will be allowed to merge their business and production operations and share profits, a move they say is necessary to ensure that both survive. `` We have been in this process for more than two years now, and it is frankly a wearying, exhausting process, with everyone's future on hold, and in fact with people not knowing if the newspaper or they have a future,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, publisher of the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> The paper's owners, <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, say the Free Press will be closed if a joint operating agreement is rejected. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, however, has said he will not discuss the newspaper question when he speaks before the Economic Club of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. His subject will be drug control. On that front, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has shaped several recommendations which now must be steered through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, including a law controlling chemicals used to process cocaine. He also seeks authorization to provide better weaponry to drug enforcement officials in source countries. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> also seeks death-penalty legislation for presidential assassins and prisoners serving life sentences who kill guards, laws to modify the requirement that improperly obtained evidence be excluded in criminal cases, stricter controls on pornography and obscenity, a ban on guns invisible to metal detectors and increased funding for prison construction. Beyond broad issues, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> also has several specific policy decisions to make, such as a 9-month-old dispute between the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> over which should have authority to track down fugitives. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> this month testified before a grand jury in an investigation of a $ 40,000-a-year job for his wife, <PERSON> Ursula </PERSON>; his involvement with a $ 1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline, his ownership of $ 14,000 in telephone company stock and his ties to the scandal-plagued <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> defense contractor, <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Two key <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> posts became vacant last month when the second-ranking official in the department and the head of the criminal division both resigned abruptly In a meeting with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> last Wednesday, one of the two, Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, told <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and other White House officials that `` <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s behavior was hurting the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>,'' an administration source said, speaking on condition he not be identified by name. `` I do n't know how morale could not be affected by the mass resignations and by the continual problems that the attorney general faces,'' the administration official said. But <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, after a follow-up conversation with <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, expressed continued support for <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. The attorney general has said he spends virtually all his time during the work week to the business of the department, and a substantial portion of the weekends. But <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> said: `` I doubt that that's totally true. I ca n't believe that given the amount of time that he has spent in front of grand juries and preparing for those visits, that all of that was done after office hours. Asked if <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s legal and personnel problems had delayed the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> ruling, <ORGANIZATION> Eastland </ORGANIZATION> said: `` I just do n't see that.'' The News, owned by <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> sought the partial merger on May 9, 1986 under the Newspaper Preservation Act, designed to preserve newspaper competition in cities where one publication is in danger of failing <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> said in January the Free Press has had operating losses of $ 100 million since 1979, and the News in the same period had operating losses of about $ 75 million.

 Hard-core smokers fidgeted and chewed their fingernails, or candy or gum, Saturday at the start of the smoking ban on domestic airline flights of two hours or less, but non-smokers rejoiced and even some smokers did n't mind. `` It's been well publicized, so people really are n't very upset,'' said <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> ticket agent <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharpeta </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Baltimore-Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. Well, most people were n't upset. `` Flying is already stressful enough, and now they're going to make it worse if they wo n't let me smoke up there,'' said <PERSON> Lother </PERSON> <PERSON> Straschnitzki </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sonoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, waiting for his flight to be called at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. `` It's going to bother me a lot.'' The federal ban on smoking on domestic flights of less than two hours went into effect at 12:01 a.m. EDT Saturday, affecting some 13,600 flights a day or about 80 percent of all domestic flights. There were no early reports of violations, which could bring a fine of up to $ 1,000. Tampering with a lavatory smoke alarm in order to sneak a smoke could bring a $ 2,000 fine. But there was confusion. <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> described a mixup on her two-hour, six-minute <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> flight to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>: `` First they said we could n't smoke and then half-way though they said we could smoke. We all had a fit, and then lit up all together.'' `` We do n't want to take away smokers' rights,'' Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, the ban's main <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> supporter, said at a news conference Saturday at <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. `` We're pro-health. `` We try to appeal to their sense of fairness,'' <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON> said of hard-core smokers. `` There are some folks who are upset about it, and I apologize to them for it.'' He said he would seek to extend the smoking ban to all flights after the new law is reviewed in two years. `` I'm thrilled. I'm so happy. I just ca n't breathe anymore on these flights,'' <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight attendant <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cale </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` I'm afraid to go to the doctor to have my lungs examined for fear of what they'll find.'' `` The new rule is a good idea,'' said <PERSON> Elva </PERSON> <PERSON> Witler </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, at the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> airport, who began smoking at age 16 but gave it up in 1965. `` I have been on planes where the smell just permeates the plane.'' An Eastern representative boarding passengers on a flight from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> apologized over the intercom to smokers. Her `` I'm sorry'' was greeted with a spontaneous `` We're not'' from about a dozen waiting passengers. <PERSON> Ahron </PERSON> <PERSON> Leichtman </PERSON>, national president of <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Smoke </ORGANIZATION>, said from his home at <LOCATION> Boca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Raton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, that the ban gave him `` a very positive, upbeat feeling.'' Some airlines offered substitutes for cigarettes, including hard candy and a chewing gum designed to lessen withdrawal symptoms. Dr. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preventive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, advised smokers to put a rubber band around the wrist of their smoking hand and snap it whenever a nicotine urge struck. Some smokers joked about the change. `` I can last two hours without cigarettes,'' said <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Silberberg </PERSON>, awaiting a flight from <LOCATION> Seattle-Tacoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. `` I can bite my nails.'' `` I survived,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brand </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, but he lit up the moment he stepped off a plane at <LOCATION> Hartsfield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. `` A smoker joked with me today about the smoking regulations,'' said <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> ticket agent <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> `` He said one good thing about them is that he can sit up in the front of the plane now and get off sooner. He said he wo n't have to be in the back of the plane waiting for 20 minutes to get off.'' And some smokers even favored the ban. `` I've been trying to quit,'' <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Irvin </PERSON>, 36, of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, said while waiting to board a flight home at <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. `` The ban is a good thing. If you ca n't last two hours without a cigarette, you need help,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mutz </PERSON>, a smoker waiting to board a flight to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Seattle-Tacoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. `` It's fine with me,'' said <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Lockhart </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lompoc </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, who described herself between puffs at <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> as a lifetime smoker. `` You can stand on your head for an hour if you have to.'' `` They're forcing me to do something I've been procrastinating about. So I'm keeping a positive attitude,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wynn </PERSON>, a smoker from <LOCATION> Highland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, who hopes the ban helps him kick the habit.

<TEXT>
 Former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> picked up 14 delegates at the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> Republican Convention on Saturday, his biggest one-day showing so far and his first delegate gain since Super Tuesday. Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won four delegates and another two were elected as uncommitted. The state convention was dominated by <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> forces who sought conciliation rather than confrontation with supporters of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the all but certain winner of the Republican presidential nomination. Support for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at this point `` is very wise,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said at a news conference as the convention opened. <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON>, who was elected as an uncommitted delegate from his home state, said Saturday he met briefly with <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> to talk about holding `` unity meetings'' that will involve all the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential candidates, and <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> supported the plan. <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON> also said the <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> supporters are vital to <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> efforts this year, especially in Southern states that have been solidly Democratic, and will be a boon because of their eagerness `` to get involved at the grass roots level.'' <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s deputy campaign manager who also was at the convention, said the <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> backers `` can have a very beneficial effect in the party if we all merge. And that's our desire.'' But <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> also said some antipathy still exists between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supporters and the <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> camp because `` passions were high, words were spoken'' earlier in the campaign. He added that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> camp is prepared to smooth over those `` rough spots'' and work with <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> to ensure he has a voice in the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said he now wants to be a `` rallying point for conservatives.'' The overwhelming <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> victory in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> included the election of his <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> campaign strategist, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Wark </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, as state <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> chairman. The <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> convention boosted <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s national delegate total to 31, while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> now has 1,081 delegates to the Republican National Convention, according to The Associated Press delegate count. That put <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> just 58 delegates shy of the 1,139 needed to win the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nomination. While <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> did well in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, he said Republican unity is what's needed now and that for him, the 1988 race was over. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> got repeated applause Friday when he addressed the convention, which at times took on a church-revival atmosphere as some delegates, their eyes closed and hands raised, prayed aloud. The convention, whose 600 delegates included more than 400 <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> backers, also began singing `` God Bless America'' at the end of <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s speech. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who has ceased active campaigning, marked his last delegate gain on March 8, when he won five in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, two in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and two in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. He won another eight delegates at a stormy state convention in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> in January.

 Friends, admirers and political allies of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, assassinated as he sought the presidency 20 years ago, were reunited Saturday at a conference to remember the senator and seek lessons from his life. `` R.F.K.

But <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON> said he believed that <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> would have ended the Vietnam War, slowed the nuclear arms race and provided new opportunities for the poor and dispossessed. `` A <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> presidency would have delivered the public from Watergate with its attendant perversions of the Constitution,'' <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON> said. In an address which had political overtones for this year's presidential primaries, the scholar and author of many political books said he believed <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> society was about to rouse itself from the conservative <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years and move into a liberal political future `` Reaganism is finished, bankrupt, used up, played out,'' he said to a loud round of applause. `` At last, it is truly bedtime for Bonzo.'' The day's gathering began with the showing of a film documenting <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s life and his role in his brother's administration. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Schrade </PERSON>, the one-time <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> campaign organizer who was shot with <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> but survived, billed the conference as focusing on the legacy of `` a victory of life over death.'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was gunned down in the kitchen of the Ambassador Hotel on June 5, 1968, moments after he claimed victory in the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Democratic presidential primary. <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON>, a Jordanian immigrant, was convicted of the killing and is serving a life term at <LOCATION> Soledad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prison </LOCATION>. Questions have been raised over the years concerning a possible second gun being fired at <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION>. Last week's release of police files in the nearly 20-year-old case has focused attention on conspiracy theories and the circumstances surrounding <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s death <PERSON> Schrade </PERSON>, who organized the conference, was chagrined at the timing of the release of files he had sought for years. `` I thought it was monstrous bad timing by -LRB- Secretary of State -RRB- March <PERSON> Fong </PERSON> <PERSON> Eu </PERSON>,'' he said, noting he had asked her to postpone the release until the conference was over. <PERSON> Schrade </PERSON> said the release focused attention again on <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s death while the conference was meant to shift that focus to his life `` All of the pain and grief had buried a lot of the legacy,'' he said. `` <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> was the best political candidate I've known in 40 years in politics,'' said <PERSON> Schrade </PERSON>. `` He was committed to real social change, to ending the war in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. He was committed to working for the underclass in this country.'' During a panel discussion, <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON>, a leader of the 1968 riots at the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Democratic Convention, said he believed that the violence at the convention would not have occurred had <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> been the candidate. `` That would have been a convention without chaos,'' <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> said, `` because <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> could work with -LRB- Mayor -RRB- <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>. Anyone who could work with <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> was quite a fellow.'' Among spectators at the conference was former <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who said he came because <PERSON> Schrade </PERSON> was his next-door neighbor but also because he found inspiration in the principles <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> pursued. `` He had such a clarity about what was right and what was wrong,'' said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. `` He just went out and tried to change things.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> declined comment on his own political future or on the contents of the book he is writing about his life in politics.

<HEAD>Protest in Second Day at Liberal Arts School</HEAD>

 Supporters joined in singing `` We Shall Overcome'' and offered advice Saturday to minority students who occupied a building at <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> for a second day to protest racial policies at the school. Parents' Weekend is under way at the 2,000-student liberal-arts college. An afternoon rally outside <ORGANIZATION> Jenness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, where the occupation was taking place, drew about 80 people including parents and faculty. The crowd, predominately white, sang the civil rights movement anthem and listened to about 40 minutes of speeches by the protesters, said college news director <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Berek </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinton </PERSON>, 21, a junior from <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, was among the protesters who came out of the building to address the crowd. `` Our efforts are part of efforts initiated four years ago to raise concerns about the presence of minority faculty here, minority concerns in the curriculum and minority students at the school,'' <PERSON> Hinton </PERSON>, who is black, said in an interview. `` There's a very strong sense of frustration, a sense of inertia. There's certainly sympathy, but over the years the school has failed to take forceful steps,'' he said. Minorities make up a record 28 percent of the 1,207 students just accepted for the fall incoming freshman class, Ms. <PERSON> Berek </PERSON> said. At present, members of minorities make up 13 percent of the student body and 10 percent of the 278-teacher faculty. About 30 students stayed in the building overnight; an additional 30 or 40 came in and out during the day, <PERSON> Hinton </PERSON> said. Parents visiting the occupied building included veterans of the civil rights movement who shared advice on how students should conduct themselves. White students were not allowed among the protesters, who include Hispanic Americans and students from <LOCATION> Polynesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hinton </PERSON> said. A group calling itself the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Racist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> took over the building Friday. The Victorian house has served as a makeshift dean's office during renovation of the main administration building. School administrators intend to run the school as usual, working out of different offices and continuing to hold talks with the protesters, Ms. <PERSON> Berek </PERSON> said. College President <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> has agreed to meet Sunday with the demonstrators. The students planned to stay in the building indefinitely, he said.

 Officials of a federal agency created to sell property from insolvent savings institutions traveled in high style and awarded no-bid contracts to former business associates _ all while receiving six-figure salaries and bonuses, a congressional report charges. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> found the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asset </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disposition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, `` to be an organization out of control'' that had `` mushroomed into a bloated bureaucracy.'' Among the potential conflicts and abuses alleged in the report: _ The owners of an executive search firm that recommended former <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Roslyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> for her job later received $ 650,000 in contracts from <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION> through another firm that they owned _ Ms <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> charged the agency for the personal travel of herself and her husband and double-billed for some travel expenses. _ <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Axley </PERSON>, former chief legal counsel of the agency, ran up a hotel bill of $ 1,200, including laundry, at a hotel in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, even though he lived in the city Neither Ms. <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Axley </PERSON> had a published home telephone listing in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> area, and calls to their former office went unanswered Saturday. However, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> quoted Ms. <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> as calling the report's allegations `` outrageous.'' House Banking Chairman <PERSON> Fernand </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> St </PERSON> <PERSON> Germain </PERSON>, in a statement accompanying the report, published Friday in the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Record </ORGANIZATION>, called for <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION> to be abolished `` as soon as possible'' and its duties re-absorbed by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` We have n't the time to wait ... to rework the unworkable,'' <ORGANIZATION> St </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germain </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON>, who took over as <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION> chief executive in February, said in an interview Friday that he is taking about six months to consider whether the agency should continue in its present structure. However, in the meantime, he promised, `` problems that are real and exist, we're going to fix.'' The purpose of <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION>, created by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which regulates 3,147 federally insured S & amp; Ls, is to bring in money for <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION>, the financially-strapped fund that guarantees S & amp; L deposits up to $ 100,000. Instead, the report _ the result of a seven-month investigation _ said: _ `` FADA ... has not been, and in all likelihood could never be, a cost-effective solution.'' _ It has evolved into a bureaucracy `` outside all prudent checks and balances. _ `` Quality performance was nearly nonexistent.'' _ <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION> employees awarded `` sole-source contracts ... to former business associates'' and still `` maintain active interest in real estate investment and development firms, and ties to the savings and loan industry that would not be appropriate for government employees.'' _ <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> `` employees and contractors -LRB- who criticized the agency -RRB- often felt threatened and intimidated. _ `` Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION> officials lived first class and received excessive salaries and bonuses _ all at the expense of <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION>, according to the report, has more than $ 5 billion worth of assets _ loans and real estate _ in its care, yet had managed by the end of 1987 to sell only $ 124 million of the property. The report said it was `` difficult to determine'' how much money <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION> has wasted, but it said the agency has directly charged $ 20 million from receiverships of failed S & amp; Ls and passed on $ 51 million more in charges from subcontractors. Despite that revenue, the agency has lost $ 15 million through the end of last year, the report said. Since its creation in late 1985, <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION> has spent $ 22 million on a staff that has grown to more than 380, $ 3 million of that for the 1987 salaries of its 32 top officials, the report said. Ms. <PERSON> Payne </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION> chief executive officer, received $ 325,000 in salaries and bonuses in 1986, a third more than the salary of the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the report noted. <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION> has spent $ 1.8 million on travel _ over and above travel to manage assets in its care _ including hotel rooms at more the $ 200 a night, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee said. Included in that is an August 1987 bill from <PERSON> Axley </PERSON> for `` $ 1,200 for charges at a luxurious <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> hotel, including laundry bills, although he lived in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>,'' the report said. It said that Ms. <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> used her FADA credit card to buy airplane tickets for herself and her husband and included the charge on her expense form, although <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION> accountants refused to pay the bill. Between January and May 1987, Ms. <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> received $ 800 through double-reporting expenses and did not repay the money until the overpayment was pointed out by congressional investigators, the report said. Also cited as a `` potential conflict of interest'' were the $ 650,000 in payments to the San Diego-based <ORGANIZATION> ConAm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, an asset management firm owned by <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> Korn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferry </PERSON>. They also own <ORGANIZATION> Korn-Ferry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, an executive search firm that was paid $ 125,000 to come up with a list of candidates for <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION> president. The list included Ms. <PERSON> Payne </PERSON>. Home telephone numbers for <PERSON> Korn </PERSON> and Ferry were not listed in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> area, and neither man returned a reporter's call to their office. The Post quoted another <ORGANIZATION> Korn-Ferry </ORGANIZATION> executive as saying that firm's recommendation of Ms. <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> and <LOCATION> ConAm </LOCATION>'s subsequent work for <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION> were `` purely coincidental.'' <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> Payne </PERSON>'s replacement, said he is cutting <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION>'s staff, having reduced the annual payroll so far by $ 1 million, and is consolidating office space He said he expects the agency will be in the black for the first quarter this year.

 Ships and airplanes searched the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> for survivors Saturday near the blazing remains of a Greek tanker that broke in two, leaving one crewman known dead and 28 people missing. But as darkness fell, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said it was suspending search operations and there was no plan to resume them Sunday. Petty Officer <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Terrill </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> said, `` Search conditions were excellent all day with good to excellent visibility, low seas and mild winds. But nothing has been spotted since the one body was recovered Friday evening.'' A Dutch cargo ship recovered the body of Polish seaman <PERSON> Andrej </PERSON> <PERSON> Szukalski </PERSON>, 41, from the oil-slicked sea near the 500-foot Athenian Venture around 6. Friday. `` He was in a lifejacket but not in a liferaft,'' said <PERSON> Terrill </PERSON> in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Terrill </PERSON> said an earlier report that the ship's log was found with the body was incorrect, and the document was the victim's passport. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officials said there were 29 people aboard the tanker, including the wives of five crewmen, and it was believed that all of the victims were Polish nationals. <PERSON> Terrill </PERSON> said the stern section of the 18,000-ton tanker, hauling gasoline and bunker fuel from <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, was still burning and `` probably will be burning for quite a bit of time.'' The bow portion sank Friday. The crippled tanker was about 800 miles east of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> when the Canadian research ship <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> spotted it ablaze after midnight 370 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Race </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> reported that one of the tanker's lifeboats had been launched and a Canadian <ORGANIZATION> coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said three life rafts and a lifeboat were missing from the tanker, leading to hope there might be survivors. But Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said the lifeboats may have been missing because they burned and there was little hope of finding any survivors. Although the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> initially said the tanker had sent no distress signals, <PERSON> Terrill </PERSON> said Saturday: `` There was a very brief SOS -LRB- Thursday -RRB- evening which was heard up and down the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. It was just one brief mayday and that's all anyone heard.'' <PERSON> Terrill </PERSON> said a Canadian airplane and the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> were joined by two <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> C-130 aircraft and a cutter in the search for survivors and they were working in much better weather late Saturday that they had earlier. Early Saturday, the tanker's fiery hulk was being buffeted in rain squalls and winds exceeding 55 mph that whipped up 5-foot swells. But later in the day, <PERSON> Terrill </PERSON> said, there were calm and rolling seas three to five feet high, with good visibility and high overcast. There was no indication what caused the fire. Patron Marine of <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, owners of the Cypriot-registered tanker, notified the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> that there had been 29 people aboard the Athenian Venture _ including 24 crewmen and the wives of five of them. About one-sixth of the ship _ the bow _ broke off and sank, with five-sixths of the rear of the ship still burning intensely, <PERSON> Terrill </PERSON> said. Capt. <PERSON> Loran </PERSON> <PERSON> Strum </PERSON> of the <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> said the tanker was burning fiercely and had broken in two by the time his ship approached. `` We could see fire through the house windows so she's all burned out in the bridge sector,'' <PERSON> Strum </PERSON> said in a ship-to-shore radio interview. `` I think I could quite safely say it would be impossible for anyone to be alive aboard.'' <PERSON> Strum </PERSON>, a 37-year veteran of the sea, said a column of smoke from the tanker's stern could be seen for 30 miles.

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s No. 2 leader assassinated last week because he planned new terrorist attacks on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and its allies, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, a magazine reported Saturday. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; World Report, quoting <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> sources in its May 2 edition, says the decision to assassinate <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Wazir </PERSON>, also known as <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jihad </PERSON>, despite known risks, was based on more than his alleged involvement in a recent bus hijacking by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> that resulted in three Israeli deaths. Quoting Israeli intelligence reports, the magazine says: `` <LOCATION> Abu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jihad </LOCATION> was said to have struck deals with <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> and various East European intelligence agencies to restore the sophisticated <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> terrorist and combat capability that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had destroyed in the invasion of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> would then launch a major new series of terrorist attacks against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> itself and Israeli interests and supporters in other countries, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' the magazine says. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jihad </PERSON> was gunned downed April 16 in his villa in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> says some foreign security specialists doubt key aspects of the Israeli version of the story and <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s reasons for revealing it. The magazine quotes one Western official as saying: `` It has self-serving aspects, involves a strange bunch of bedfellows and does n't make sense for the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> at this time.'' The officials also are skeptical of <LOCATION> Abu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jihad </LOCATION>'s alleged presence at meetings with leaders he has fought for years, and whether the <ORGANIZATION> Mossad </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s intelligence agency, could identify precise details of plans for joint actions by <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> groups that have battled one another as fiercely as they have fought the Jewish state, according to the magazine. `` But <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> sources insist that the reasons for hitting <LOCATION> Abu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jihad </LOCATION> _ and striking now _ were compelling,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> News says.

 Church bells tolled 28 times as hundreds of people gathered Saturday for a memorial service in honor of the construction workers killed a year ago in the collapse of an apartment building. `` Look over your shoulders and remember the frailty of our humanity and the eternalness of our spirit,'' Monsignor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheyd </PERSON>, pastor of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Augustine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION>, said just before ceremony broke up early during a sudden downpour. Scheyd spoke in <LOCATION> Wheeler </LOCATION> park, which houses a monument to the men killed in the L'Ambiance Plaza apartment building. The accident site is visible from the park, which is adjacent to City Hall. Clergymen prayed and read each victim's name, and black-attired survivors of the victims huddled with politicians in dark suits and construction workers in jeans as the skies darkened. As the cold rain got heavier, the small group of politicans standing under a covered platform who were scheduled to talk chose to end the ceremony early, before a moment of silence planned for 1:36 p.m., the minute that the building collapsed on April 23, 1987. `` There was something very symbolic here ... that we were covered and they -LRB- families and rescue volunteers -RRB- were n't,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Shays </PERSON>. As the crowd quickly broke up, a lone construction worker in jeans and a green hard hat lingered in the heavy rain, then turned and walked slowly away, the last to leave. Shortly after the ceremony, there were no mourners at the site. But two sprays of fresh red, white and pink carnations adorned the fence and a twisted blue sign with the name of the project still lay on the ground. The memorial service began earlier at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Augustine </LOCATION>'s, where clergymen encouraged survivors to reach out to each other and remember the outpouring of generosity from people around the world. They also noted that there had been two births and one adoption in victims' families in the past year. `` Although we were stricken by tragedy on April 23, 1987, we were not destroyed,'' <PERSON> Scheyd </PERSON> said. `` As we come here today to look back, let us not be afraid to look forward. The future will come for each of us.'' After the ceremony, several politicians and union leaders focused on the future of legislative efforts to improve construction safety. `` When people say this will never happen again, I wonder if it will,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. He said a bill requiring employers to post a notice if dangerous chemicals were on a site was blocked by a recent <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> filibuster. `` Safety in the workplace seems to be a low priority with my colleagues and with the people,'' <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON> said. `` There was a tremendous showing here -LRB- today -RRB- _ now we need to work on legislation and see this does n't happen again,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, business manager for Local 488 of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>. `` The hearts of the families are still broken.''

 The first World Cup Chess Tournament closed Saturday and experts said the victorious <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> remains a force in the game and a threat to champion <PERSON> Garri </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON>. The tournament was the first of six competitons that form the World Cup championship. Soviet grandmaster <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> won the the $ 20,000 top prize Friday by scoring 11 points out of a possible 16, a point ahead of fellow Soviet <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Salov </PERSON>. The World Cup series was organized by the <ORGANIZATION> Grandmasters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a body set up in 1986 at the urging of champion <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON>, also of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, to increase the influence of the game's leading grandmasters. <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> and other grandmasters have feuded often with the the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, the game's governing body. Experts said during closing ceremonies Saturday that <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> remains a major threat to <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON>'s supremacy. <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON>, who did not compete in this tournament, beat <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> in 1985 to become the world champion. `` This was a normal result for <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON>.

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Premier <PERSON> Ciriaco </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON> won final Parliamentary approval Saturday for his new government but the five-party coalition is already embroiled in a dispute over <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> policy. After a two-day debate, the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> leader won a confidence vote in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> 177-106. The coalition had won a vote of confidence in the Chamber of Deputies Thursday. Both votes were a formality since the coalition has a comfortable majority in both houses. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON> formed <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s 48th post-World War II government on April 13 after a month-long political crisis caused by the resignation of Premier <PERSON> Giovanni </PERSON> <PERSON> Goria </PERSON>, a fellow Christian Democrat who served for 7 -LCB- months. The government is made up of the five parties that have governed most of the decade _ the dominant <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, the Socialists and the small Republican, Social Democrat and Liberal parties. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON> has expressed hope his government can last through the end of the legislative term in 1992, but a dispute developed as he was winning parliamentary approval. It involves <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s policies toward <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> including the months of violence in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and the April 16 assassination in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> military chief <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>. It is widely believed <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON> was slain by Israeli commandos. Socialist leader <PERSON> Bettino </PERSON> <PERSON> Craxi </PERSON>, a former premier, proposed that <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> give official recognition to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> does have a representative in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, but he does not have full diplomatic status. <PERSON> Craxi </PERSON>'s suggestion was criticized by the Liberals and Republicans, the two most conservative parties in the coalition. At a news conference Saturday in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Craxi </PERSON> added a new element to the debate. He suggested the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Common Market -RRB- assume a mandate to administer the Israeli-occupied territories for a transitional period pending a solution of the Palestinian problem. <PERSON> Craxi </PERSON> said Palestinians in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> were oppressed and had the `` right and duty'' to rebel against Israeli occupation. He said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had the right to demand secure frontiers `` but nothing else.'' The Socialist leader also said the Italian government should lodge a protest with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> if it is confirmed that Italian airspace was violated by an Israeli <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 707 that reportedly helped direct the commando team that killed <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>. Italian air controllers have reported that an Israeli plane, which identified itself as a civilian aircraft, passed through their jurisdictional zone near <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION> the night of the assassination. In his 90-minute speech before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote, <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON> said the position of Italian governments on the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict has always been `` constant, intelligent and active'' and that he would follow that path. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> has maintained good relations with both <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the Arab world. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON> called the assassination of <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON> a `` useless crime, which makes the process of peace more difficult.'' On domestic issues, <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON> restated his intentions to streamline political institutions. He has promised to make the legislative process more efficient and strengthen the executive branch. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON>'s close adviser on institutional reforms, Sen. <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruffilli </PERSON>, was assassinated a week ago by Red Brigades terrorists.

 Separatist militants on this <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> island clashed with police Sunday as voting began in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s presidential election. Two policemen were reported shot in separate incidents. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Melanesian </ORGANIZATION> separatists holding 27 police officers hostage evaded a police search in this French territory and demanded that elections be canceled. Minister of Overseas Territories <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> was dispatched from <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Saturday by Premier <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> to oversee the voting. After the residents of the tiny <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> islands of <PERSON> Wallis </PERSON> and Futuna, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonians </LOCATION> were the first to cast ballots on Sunday. It was still early morning in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Voters in the French territories also participate in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s national elections. Police in <LOCATION> Noumea </LOCATION> said separatists erected barricades in several villages to disrupt voting. One policeman was reported wounded by a gunshot in <LOCATION> Pouembout </LOCATION>, on the main island's west coast 160 miles north of <LOCATION> Noumea </LOCATION>, and a second wounded at <LOCATION> Canala </LOCATION> on the east coast. In pre-election violence on Saturday, three security men of a pro-French party were shot and wounded and police fired tear gas in two towns to stop rioting. The hostages were taken Friday during a battle at a police station that left three officers dead and about 20 people wounded on the tiny island of <LOCATION> Ouvea </LOCATION>, about 80 miles off the coast of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>. Two wounded officers and four others were hospitalized in <LOCATION> Noumea </LOCATION>, the capital. One officers had been shot in the head and flown to a hospital in <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. Kanaks, as native Melanesians are known, make up 43 percent of the territory's 145,000 people. The rest are European settlers, Polynesians and Asians. Many Melanesians seek independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, while most of the European settlers wish to remain French. The separatists vowed to boycott Sunday's election and do what they could to interfere with voting. <PERSON> Leopold </PERSON> <PERSON> Joredie </PERSON>, security minister of the separatist `` government of Kanaky,'' said the kidnappers are demanding that 300 police reinforcements be withdrawn, that <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> send emissaries to discuss independence and that the election be canceled. <PERSON> Joredie </PERSON>, who has been in contact with the kidnappers, said the hostages were in good condition. However, he added, the kidnappers were `` ready to keep them -LRB- the gendarmes -RRB- as long as necessary. `` If the government wants to intervene, they must take responsiblity,'' he said. About 160 additional reinforcements from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gendarmerie </ORGANIZATION> left <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Friday to assist the 3,000 police already in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>. The kidnappers were believed to have divided into groups and fled into a forest in northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>. A spokesman for the gendarmerie in <LOCATION> Noumea </LOCATION>, who refused to be identified, said hundreds of officers were searching for the hostages. Also Saturday, three security men with the pro-French Rally for <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION> in the Republic party were shot and wounded while driving through <LOCATION> Canala </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Lafleur </PERSON>, the party's president, said the men were in <LOCATION> Canala </LOCATION> to `` protect those who want to vote Sunday.'' <PERSON> Lafleur </PERSON>'s party is the local branch of <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>'s conservative Rally for the Republic. The <ORGANIZATION> Kanak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, the main separatist organization, is boycotting the elections. It also boycotted last year's referendum on independence, saying only Melanesians should be allowed to vote. The territory voted overwhelmingly for <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. The bloodshed is part of long-simmering tensions in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>, which has been under direct French rule since 1853 and is <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s largest possession in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> revisited a Democratic stronghold Saturday to collect favors on a blue-collar cause he supported and to tap the working class sentiments he hopes to represent in the White House. `` In the Mon Valley I stood with you, fighting for our children ... fighting for justice. Now, on Tuesday, my friends ... stand with me,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said at the first of three riverside stops in <LOCATION> Monongahela </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> towns that have been staggered by the decline of steelmaking in the American industry's birthplace. In January 1985, after losing the 1984 Democratic presidential nomination, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> appeared in neighboring <ORGANIZATION> Duquesne </ORGANIZATION> with unemployed steel workers to fight for the reopening of a giant ironmaking blast furnace affectionately known as <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Six </PERSON>. The furnace and the surrounding <ORGANIZATION> Duquesne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> have been closed by <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and will be demolished to make way for an industrial park. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, reminded Saturday of the disappointing results of the fruitless struggle to have the furnace restarted, said, `` It was the principle ... to try to sustain their faith and their will to fight back.'' `` Those workers are fighting against the odds of a government administration that does not care about their predicament, `` he said as he campaigned before Tuesday's <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> primary in which <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is pitted against the current <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> front-runner, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Between stops, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and his campaign workers traveled the <LOCATION> Monongahela </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> on a sightseeing boat, floating past red brick and aluminum-sided homes between scrap yards, coal piles, rail sidings, fuel tanks, greening valley walls, churches and war memorials of the struggling towns of <LOCATION> Monongahela </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> and <LOCATION> McKeesport </LOCATION>. The Democrats' 12,000-to-2 ,000 voter registration edge over Republicans in <LOCATION> McKeesport </LOCATION> is typical of the grip the party has had on <LOCATION> Allegheny </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> over the last 50 years <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> beat <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> by 88,000 votes in the county in 1984, said <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> Democratic Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucchino </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was one of the biggest names to join the fight for <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Six </PERSON>. `` I think he's gone out on a limb to identify himself with that sort of small and powerless struggle,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Demarest </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mellon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> English </ORGANIZATION> professor and his wife, <PERSON> Marlene </PERSON>, said they liked <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as one who could broaden the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` If we ca n't bring blacks into mainstream politics, we're in trouble,'' he said. `` Our campaign is changing the face of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` Coalitions are coming together that never were involved in politics before.'' One such newcomer is <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Heckel </PERSON>, 62, of Mars. `` <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> represents humanity. He'd like to build rather than destroy,'' said <PERSON> Heckel </PERSON>, a World War II <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> veteran who has been to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to help the village of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cedro </LOCATION> rebuild after being devastated by the U.S.-backed Contras. `` Our -LRB- foreign -RRB- policy is just a disaster, and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is the only one who represents change,'' <PERSON> Heckel </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Demarest </PERSON> favors worker-ownership as a way to revive the area's manufacturing economy `` The inability of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> to do that in steel is kind of a missing link, and I see <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as being able to communicate strongly on that level,'' <PERSON> Demarest </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said rebuilding roads, bridges and other public structures would re-employ displaced steel workers. `` We're not fighting for welfare, we're fighting for fair share,'' he said at a park beside <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION>'s closed National Tube Works, the now silent engine of <LOCATION> McKeesport </LOCATION>'s whimpering economy. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> salted his three speeches with invocations against dope, despair and prejudice. He encouraged his listeners to have hope and to organize behind him Tuesday.

<HEAD>Sister Supports Use of Brother's Heart Before He Was Identified</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEWPORT BEACH, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The use of a brain-dead man's heart for a transplant before he was identified was justified because it helped save another life, the man's sister said. The transplant was criticized Friday by medical ethicists. `` I'm happy that at least, even if his body is dead, his heart is beating in another person,'' said <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Celsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON>, 20, sister of <PERSON> Eleno </PERSON> <PERSON> Ulloa </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, 19. `` I'm also very satisfied with the explanation that they gave me, the authorities.'' <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> was found unconscious with no identification on a <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> street early Tuesday and declared brain dead the next day after surgery to remove a clot in the brain. Police believe he was the victim of a blow to the head. Before he was identified, doctors at Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian transplanted his heart into Dr. <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphreys </PERSON>, 58, a retired <LOCATION> Fountain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> physician suffering from a degenerative heart disease. A nursing supervisor who declined to give her name said Saturday that <PERSON> Humphreys </PERSON>' condition was listed as critical but stable. <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>'s heart was transplanted under a state law that allows removal of an organ without the permission of the donor or his family if police are unable to identify someone after making a diligent effort for 24 hours. His relatives did n't find out his heart was transplanted until Friday. `` I think it was good what they did, taking my brother's heart,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Torres </PERSON> said Friday `` They saved another life. Yes, it is painful for us, but we have to accept the reality of it.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Torres </PERSON> said she last saw her brother on Monday, and that on Tuesday, her father, contacted her and said he had been unable to reach his son. A friend who works at the hospital told family members a man on life support there could be the missing man, and they gave officials there information on <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Torres </PERSON> said that on Friday morning, people she assumed were police officers in plain clothes, took her to the hospital to identify her brother's body. The use of organs for transplant before the victim was identified drew some criticism. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Annas </PERSON>, a law and ethics professor at <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, said the procedure was `` incredible. `` If other people have done it, they have n't talked about it in the newspaper, that's for sure,'' <PERSON> Annas </PERSON> said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, an ethics professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> and a member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> on Organ Transplantation defended the operation. `` First of all, we're dealing with someone who is dead. It's not like they're harming the person. That body is either going to get cremated or buried,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said. `` I'm not sure there's any serious abuse if they're complying with applicable law.''

<HEAD>Movie `The Last Emperor' Draws Large Audiences in Taiwan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 `` The Last Emperor,'' the first movie shot in communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to be shown on this Nationalist Chinese island, opened to large crowds Saturday. People formed lines to buy tickets to the movie that won nine Academy Awards. It is about the life of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s last emperor and was filmed by an international production company. `` It is very touching,'' reporter <PERSON> Huang </PERSON> <PERSON> Wu-lan </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> said of the movie that opened in 20 theaters in <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION> and five other cities. She said Italian director <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertolucci </PERSON> presented a Chinese world `` very real and persuasive to the young generation of <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> growing up in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>.'' A vast majority of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s nearly 20 million people are ethnic Chinese. The Chinese Nationalist government fled to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> in 1949 after losing a civil war to the communists and has since refused all official contacts with mainland <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Unofficially the policy has been relaxed in recent months. Taiwanese Chinese can travel to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to visit family members and many mainland products are now legally sold in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. Last month, the government sanctioned the showing of foreign films shot on the mainland, but movies made by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> still are forbidden. Government spokesman <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Yu-ming </PERSON> said the Nationalists allowed the showing of `` The Last Emperor'' because the movie `` does not contain the poisonous elements of communism nor violate our national interests.'' But <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> said government censors cut a 30-second jail scene in which prisoners sing `` Dongfang Hong,'' or `` The East is Red,'' which praises communism. `` We do n't have to listen to this song,'' <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> told reporters Thursday. Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, which screens movies, said a brief scene showing the young emperor flirting in bed with his empress also was cut. `` The Last Emperor'' follows the life of <PERSON> Pu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yi </PERSON> as child emperor of the Qing Dynasty, later <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s World War II puppet ruler of <LOCATION> Manchuria </LOCATION>, then a prisoner of the communists and finally a gardener. <PERSON> Pu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yi </PERSON> died in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in 1967.

The two sessions fetched a total of $ 5,314,347, more than twice what <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s expected, said <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s auction house. `` It was a wonderful day,'' said <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON>, who said the sky-high prices were attributable `` to some degree -LRB- to -RRB- the <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> factor, but to a great degree the quality and rarity of the objects.'' Proceeds will benefit the <ORGANIZATION> Andy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warhol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Visual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION>, which will support and award grants to cultural institutions in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and abroad. The highest bid was $ 275,000 by an anonymous private collector for a wood center table by <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Rennie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mackintosh </PERSON>, made about 1902. <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s expected the table to sell for $ 30,000 to $ 50,000. The collection includes more than 60 works, including paintings by <PERSON> Jasper </PERSON> <PERSON> Johns </PERSON>, <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lichtenstein </PERSON>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenquist </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cy </PERSON> <PERSON> Twombly </PERSON>. Before Saturday's bidding, <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> had expected the collection to sell for $ 10 to $ 15 million. The crowd, estimated by <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s at 2,200, seemed as eclectic as the collection. Some came to buy specific items and others came to buy something connected with <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON>. One man, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolleck </PERSON>, came to buy something for himself but was disappointed: `` The prices are outrageous; they went out of sight. It's not worth it.'' Most of the people actually buying were dealers looking for rare items. `` I came to buy some of the art deco vases because it is very difficult to get them in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, but they are too expensive here,'' said <PERSON> Vincenzo </PERSON> <PERSON> Geddes </PERSON> da Filicaia, an antique dealer from <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. `` I could get them cheaper elsewhere, but it is because of the <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> name that I can not afford them.'' <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> fans merely wanted something connected with the famed pop artist, who died last year. `` I wanted a very strong piece of jewelry connected with <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tronn </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, a theatrical producer and writer, looking at a piece that would go on sale Sunday. `` I saw this bracelet and fell in love with it.'' <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> also came to buy a graduation present for her son, who she said was `` an artist somewhat like <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON>, and I thought it would be nice to get him a graduation gift that had belonged to <PERSON> Andy </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, who has attended many auctions, decribed Saturday's sale as one of the most exciting she had been to. `` It's mind boggling,'' she said. `` There are so many newcomers, its like a party.'' <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s distributed a special sheet of advice for first-time bidders. A sharkskin-covered console by <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Legrain </PERSON> fetched $ 209,000, as did a matching table, both purchased by a foreign dealer. <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s had estimated winning bids between $ 40,000 and $ 60,000 for each piece. An ivory inlaid armchair by <PERSON> Ebene </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Macassar </PERSON> was sold for $ 154,000 to a private collector. <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s expected $ 40,000 to $ 60,000. A silver tureen and cover made by Frenchman <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Puiforcat </PERSON>, which was bought by a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> dealer for $ 55,000. <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s had estimated it would go for $ 10,000 to $ 15,000. A silver, four-piece tea and coffee set, also by <PERSON> Puiforcat </PERSON>, was sold to a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> dealer for $ 44,000, while <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s officially had expected $ 12,000 to $ 16,000. One of the most unusual purchases, according to <PERSON> Weigman </PERSON>, was a gold and silver ring by <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Despres </PERSON> estimated at $ 1,800 to $ 2,500 and sold to an anonymous buyer for $ 28,600. The remaining auctions will offer an enormous collection of wristwatches, Indian rugs, folk art, drawings and prints. <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON>'s collection of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> classical and federal furniture, which <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s called the largest and most important available for auction in many years, will be sold Tuesday

<TEXT>
 A year after Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> signed one of the more controversial levies in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> history, lawmakers are avoiding tax talk because of battles that left many licking political wounds in an election year. One year ago Saturday, <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> signed a bill initiating a 5 percent tax on service industries ranging from lawn care to law and from accounting to advertising. The tax sparked an outcry from many service groups, and companies such as <ORGANIZATION> Lever </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Nabisco </PERSON> withdrew local advertising of national brands. The protests prompted <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> to reverse himself and lead a successful drive to repeal the tax and replace it with a sales tax increase. But the wear and tear of the tax battle is still evident, and some say the state merely put off a long-term revenue problem. The Legislature, which is three weeks into this year's two-month regular session, shows signs of burnout after five special sessions in the last 15 months. `` I think the session in terms of actually starting has almost been delayed by the backup of special sessions and the result of everything that has happened in the last year,'' said House Speaker <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>. Three of the five sessions concerned the services tax, which had been heralded as fair because it tapped the state's fastest growing economic sector and because higher-income people purchase more services than those with lower incomes. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, a self-proclaimed fiscal conservative who does not face re-election until 1990, still is working to rebuild his tarnished standing with voters. Proponents of the services tax said it would ensure adequate revenue to provide services to the state's burgeoning population, and they were outraged when <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> flip-flopped on the measure last August. The governor also angered Republicans because he pushed for a 1 percentage point increase in sales tax as a replacement instead of meeting a 1986 campaign pledge to cut $ 800 million from state spending. In his State of the State address earlier this month, <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> promised to veto any tax bill sent to his desk this year. `` The governor has not intentions of supporting the services tax again,'' press secretary <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> said. But some legislators, including <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>, predict that the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> is likely to consider another services tax eventually. The boost in the sales tax to 6 percent, which took effect Feb. 1, is projected to raise $ 1 billion this year, just as the services tax was expected to do. But economists say the services tax would produce more revenue over time as the state's services sector grows, revenue that some lawmakers believe is badly needed. The governor has proposed a $ 20.3 billion budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1, up from $ 18.5 billion this year. Many Democratics say even that increase would not satisfy the needs of a growing population _ the state had just over 12 million residents in 1987 and officials say it is growing by up to 1,000 people a day _ and correct for previous inadequacies in some programs. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> must reach a budget compromise by July 1. The governor has proposed increasing fees for such things as state university tuition, fishing licenses, and environmental permits. Lawmakers have quietly discussed increasing gasoline taxes to help pay for transportation needs, but no formal proposal has been launched and <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> has refused to consider such a plan.

 Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was quoted Saturday as saying he could retire any time, but that caving in to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pressure to resign would have a domino effect on the rest of <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> can go any day, on Aug. 12, Nov. 3, Dec. 19, the first of January, 1989,'' the armed forces chief and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s de facto ruler said in an interview with the pro-government newspaper `` La Estrella de <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'' -LRB- The Star of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> -RRB-. `` The calendar is open and full of dates.'' But <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> gave no indication he is willing to step down soon. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who has been indicted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug trafficking charges he denies, has been head of the 15,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> since 1983. His official biography says he is 50 years old, but his high school yearbooks indicate he is 54. As he has in the past, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said economic and other pressures applied by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to force his ouster are motivated by political considerations unrelated to the drug charges against him. Although he did not specifically refer to the matter, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has said previously that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> actions are the result of his refusal to help the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Administration overthrow <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist Sandinista government. If he submits to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pressure, the general said, `` It will mean that like a domino, the destiny of all other Latin American peoples is marked.'' `` When a people are not docile to an empire, those people and their leaders will be made a target of that empire,'' said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> also scoffed at reports that some opposition figures and the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> have been secretly trying to negotiate his resignation with his supporters, including leaders of the major pro-government political party. `` It's too bad they're not talking with Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>,'' the general said, adding that many opposition leaders `` are trying to ride the wave and gain prestige.'' `` They all want to be like <PERSON> Monsignor </PERSON> <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y Bravo, they want to be like <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>, <PERSON> Vinicio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerezo </PERSON> or the secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y Bravo is the Catholic archbishop of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> who has mediated talks between that government and rebels <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Cerezo </ORGANIZATION> are the presidents of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> who pushed for those negotiations. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> hierachy called on the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration Friday to end its sanctions against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and said the country has suffered enough. `` We can not continue like this,'' the church said in an eight-page pastoral letter signed by Archbishop <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> and the nation's 10 bishops. Describing the sanctions as the cause of `` misery and desperation'' for thousands of Panamanians, the letter said they go beyond `` any strategy of political pressure and constitute by themselves a threat to the life of our people.'' Speaking with reporters on Saturday, <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> was going through `` the pathetic and slow agony of a nation whose economy is rapidly being destroyed.'' `` In two or three weeks there will be chaos in this country'' if the sanctions are not lifted, he said. The archbishop called for urgent negotiations to resolve the crisis. Some talks are being held but `` they are not the really effective conversations that carry commitment that the nation needs,'' he said. In its efforts to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has cut off all military and economic aid to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, blocked its assets in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and prohibited any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> payments to the government. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> uses the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar for its currency. The sanctions, combined with a lengthy shutdown of the nation's 120 banks and a two-week general strike in March, have brought <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s economy to a virtual halt Noriega-backed supporters in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> voted Feb. 26 to oust President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> a day after <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> tried to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, whom the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> still recognizes as the country's head of state, has remained in hiding in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> since his ouster.

<TEXT>
 The memory of an anti-slavery protest by Quakers 300 years ago should stir consciences against modern-day injustices, a group that marked the event was told Saturday. `` I think the real question that we should be asking ourselves today, especially those of us who are white, is how in the name of God could it be that it has taken us 300 years to get rid of racism and we still have n't done it,'' <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Cary </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Friends </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said. `` The only thing that I can think of that's encouraging is that for the past 35 years, we've been gaining on it.'' <PERSON> Cary </PERSON> spoke to about 300 people at a vacant lot in the city's <LOCATION> Germantown </LOCATION> section, which was the site of a house where where <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pastorius </PERSON> and three other <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quakers </ORGANIZATION> in 1688 drafted one of the earliest recorded protests against slavery, according to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germantown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protest </ORGANIZATION>, the organization that sponsored the gathering The statement was forwarded to larger Quaker assemblies, which tabled it. It was not until 1776 that <PERSON> Quakers </PERSON>, who became leaders of the abolition movement, forbade slaveholding by their members. In 1780, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> became the first state to pass a law phasing out slavery. One speaker told the audience that the German and Dutch Quakers who authored the statement saw only the beginnings of a rigid form of slavery. `` We think of their protest as a protest against something that was in place. It was not,,'' said <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Germantown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> and a history professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> `` It was a brave and courageous thing in a new land with a new language for them to do.'' The organizers of the commemoration drew up a petition called `` 1988 <LOCATION> Germantown </LOCATION> Protest,'' which said, `` Our <LOCATION> Germantown </LOCATION> forbears would have us stand today with the homeless, the hungry, the unemployed and the neglected.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpkins </PERSON>, a retired tax assessor, said the need for protests still existed. `` Today, the idea of slavery of men does n't exist, but the shortcomings of life such as a lack of decent housing, waste of youth and other areas where the quality of life is wanting,'' <PERSON> Simpkins </PERSON> said.

 Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who put his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination on hold Thursday, scored big gains at the expense of <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> elected national delegates at congressional district conventions Saturday. But the big winner in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> was still <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the front-runner for the party's nomination following a big victory last Tuesday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s primary. Of 26 delegates elected at the district conventions Saturday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> claimed 12, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> seven and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> five, with two others elected as uncommitted. That breakdown will dictate how 13 more <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> delegates are elected at a meeting of the Democratic State Convention on May 14. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will claim seven of those 13 for a total of 19 elected delegates from the Sunflower State. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> will split the other six at-large delegates, giving <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> a total of 10 of the elected <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> delegates and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> eight. <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> also will have two uncommitted elected delegates and six so-called super delegates from elected and party officials for its total of 45 delegates at the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> in July. The super delegates are officially uncommitted and none has yet declared a preference between <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, the only remaining active candidates. Based on voting at county caucuses held March 19, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had been projected to win 11 delegates at the district level. He got one more, when previously uncommitted delegates threw in with the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> forces at the 4th District convention in <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>. That took a delegate away from <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also lost delegates to <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> at the 2nd District convention in <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION> and at the 3rd District convention in <LOCATION> Prairie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>. When <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> gained those two delegates at the district level, it enabled him to meet a party requirement that a candidate garner at least 15 percent of the delegates in order to contend for the 13 state delegates. With eight delegates from the district conventions to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 10, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> was able, mathematically, to claim three of the 13 state delegates <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also will get three of the delegates to be named by the state committee, while <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will get seven of them. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would have won 10 delegates at the district level and six more at the state level for a total of 16 if he had maintained his support from the county caucuses. But the erosion cost him six delegates, enabling <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> to add five to what had been projected for him. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> picked up the other delegate <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> lost from his projected total following the local caucuses five weeks ago. `` The reason for the shifts is the <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> people stayed in there and picked up the uncommitted in key places,'' said state party Chairman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Parrish </PERSON>. `` Had it not been for the 15 percent threshold, they would have had five delegates based on the county caucuses,'' <PERSON> Parrish </PERSON> said. `` Now they recaptured them, plus one. This shifting around got him the boost he needed.'' <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelps </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION> attorney who was a chief organizer for <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> in the 2nd District of <LOCATION> northeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, said, `` We're just delighted.

 Democratic presidential candidates <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> called on President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Saturday to reconsider his threat to veto a trade bill that includes a provision requiring companies to give advance notice before closing plants. Debating for the second night in a row, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> continued their kid-glove competition for their party's presidential nomination, steadfastly avoiding strong criticism of each other Even when pressed to cite differences, the two candidates lapsed into familiar campaign rhetoric that hardly qualified as political attacks. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> cited his proposals for specific budget figures to deal with national problems, while <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> cited his experience as governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. `` I have put the numbers together to pay for my dreams,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` I take the heat, but I am consistent.'' `` I do n't just talk about jobs,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` I've helped to create and save hundreds of thousands of jobs.'' After the debate, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` did not answer the question of the budget. ... I know it's good to project for a national health care plan, which I support. But it will cost.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> appeared in the debate press room after <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and responded to the former civil rights actvist's criticism by saying, `` I've already made many commitments in dollars. ... I know what it's like to walk into a deficit. ... The president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had better be somebody who knows how to mop up red ink.'' The candidates were given some of the questions in advance of the forum which concentrated on the problems of the steel industry. `` The point <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> is making is a very sound one,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said during a discussion on education. It was typical of the interchange between the two candidates. Asked what promises the candidates would make to the economically distressed residents of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said: `` I hope the president will sign the new trade bill.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> joined in that plea and also said, `` We can not allow slave or repressed labor to undercut organized labor. ... So long as there is slave labor among the coal miners and steelworkers in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, slave labor will undercut organized labor.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has cited the plant-closing provision as one of his principal objections to the legislation. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also called for creation of an American investment bank to finance projects to repair the nation's infrastructure. `` A bridge closes in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> every other day,'' he said. Earlier in the day, at a stop in <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he was unsure of whether <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has any interest in a No. 2 spot on the Democratic ticket, a subject which came up at the Friday night debate. `` I asked him if he were interested but he did n't tell me,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. The two rivals began the day campaigning at opposite ends of the state _ <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the east and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in the west. Campaigning on the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> waterfront, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, `` It's important that we run a strong and positive campaign I do n't think the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are interested in what I think of <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> or what he thinks of me. `` They want to know what kind of leadership we're going to provide for this country.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaigned by boat, stopping for rallies along the <LOCATION> Monongahela </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> which runs through <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. After his strong showing in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary on April 19, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was heavily favored to take another jump toward the nomination when <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Democrats vote on Tuesday. At stake in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> were 178 Democratic delegates. Pre-primary polls gave <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> a big lead among <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Democrats, and he was favored to win the two key contests on Tuesday _ the presidential preference beauty contest vote and the separate election of convention delegates. The <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> Inquirer and the <ORGANIZATION> Centre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> endorsed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in their Sunday editions. On Friday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> got the endorsement of the <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> Post-Gazette, while <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> received the support of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. Many other newspapers in the state do not plan to endorse a candidate before the primary. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told a crowd of some 500 at the first of his three riverside rallies that `` leadership does not follow opinion polls, it molds opinion. It takes the heat.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s Saturday campaigning aboard a sightseeing boat was aimed at communities struggling to overcome job losses and plant closings that accompanied the decline of steel making in the <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> area. In <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, meanwhile, Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, who put his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination on hold Thursday, scored big gains as the state's Democrats elected national delegates at congressional district conventions Saturday. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, however, claimed most of the delegates elected, winning 12, while <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> got seven and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> five, with two others elected as uncommitted. That breakdown will dictate how 13 more <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> delegates are elected at a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> on May 14, when <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will claim seven more and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> will split the other six at-large delegates. The latest <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> delegate count gave <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> 1,075.15 and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, the only other active candidate, 836.1. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has 427.55 and uncommitted number 599.75. A total of 2,081 was needed for the nomination. In a reminder that there still was a race for the Republican nomination, however lopsided, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> captured the lion's share of 20 delegates chosen Saturday at the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> Republican Convention The former television evangelist picked up 14 delegates, his biggest one-day showing so far and his first delegate gain since Super Tuesday, while Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won four delegates and another two were elected as uncommitted. But the victory still left <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> more than 1,000 delegates behind <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the all but certain <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee. A strong showing in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> could boost <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> over the 1,139 delegates needed for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination. The AP count gave <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> 1,081 and <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> 31. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was campaigning as if his principal opponent were overconfidence. `` Every single primary is important. Please do n't pay any attention to the polls,'' he told a union audience. `` We need a big turnout. Everybody has to vote. And you have to vote not only for me but for my delegates.'' At nearly every stop he reminded voters that he was leading by 50 points in the polls in 1978 when he lost the Democratic gubernatorial primary to a far lesser known opponent. `` We were all looking at our statistics and we were n't remembering that it's out on the ball field where you have to win that game,'' he said At the same time he sounded optimistic about the chances of taking the White House back from the Republicans. `` We're going to take back the presidency for the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and for the country in November. It's out there to be won. The people of this country are ready for a change. You know and I know. We hear it every day,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told about 100 people at a <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> hall in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, his second stop Saturday morning. `` They want an attorney general we can be proud of, not an attorney general we're embarrassed about.''

 They are more subdued and thoughtful now, their hair shorter and their waists larger. But 20 years after they shut down <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, these soulmates of the revolution remember those heady days with pride. `` The moment we had there _ the power we felt, the experience of turning defeat into victory _ has to be recovered,'' historian <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Naison </PERSON> told his classmates, gathered once more at the <LOCATION> Morningside </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION> campus for a weekend reunion. At panel discussions, a picnic and a party, these veterans of the campus uprising recalled how about 1,000 people, mostly students, barricaded themselves inside five campus buildings for the week of April 23, 1968. The protest closed the college and drew international attention to their opposition to racism, the Vietnam War and the status quo in general. Acting <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> Dean <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> was held hostage. Professor <PERSON> Orest </PERSON> <PERSON> Ranum </PERSON> lost a decade's research when a protester torched his files. Protesters <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Egan </PERSON> were married in occupied Fayerweather Hall by Episcopal chaplain <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Starr </PERSON>, who crawled in through the window. After a week, <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> officials called in the police to clear the buildings. Nearly 700 people were arrested in brawls between police and protesters, and 103 people were injured, 85 of them students or teachers. A student strike ensued, and a month later students again occupied a college building to protest the discipline of protest leaders; again the police moved in, this time with 68 arrests and 177 injuries. `` This reunion is an example of what the university has always provided _ a forum for the open discussion of ideas,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Knubel </PERSON>. `` Reunions can be useful. Looking back almost always helps us look ahead.'' Several hundred alumni milled around Earl Hall on Saturday, wearing bright orange tags that listed the buildings they had occupied. `` This is not the ` me generation,''' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurwitz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, a free-lance cinematographer. `` Everybody here and everyone I know is a trace of the good things.'' <PERSON> Hurwitz </PERSON> recalled `` the incredible unity, a kind of physical feeling. It was a triumph of morality in a way that morality has rarely triumphed since.'' On Saturday, rain forced the picnic inside, after which more than 500 people listened to a panel of former campus activists discuss how their lives had been changed by the turbulent era. Then everyone adjourned for Chinese food and a party, with dancing to rock' n' roll, both old and new. `` There's an atmosphere of great camaraderie, people talking about what they're doing now. It's a general good feeling,'' said <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Foner </PERSON>, one of the event's organizers and a graduate student in 1968. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Crebs </PERSON>, who attended <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> in the 1970s, said the informal conversations after the panel discussion were most interesting. `` It's sort of sweet, like people around the campfire,'' said <PERSON> Crebs </PERSON>, 33, who lives in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` When I was deciding on college, people told me, ` Do n't go to <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, they go on strike there.' And now it turns out all these are all well-meaning, kind folks who had the best interest of the rest of us at heart.'' On Friday night, the bluejeans were teamed with a few ties and sports jackets, a few paunches, and plenty of smiles and embraces as former soulmates greeted one another at a campus auditorium. Buzzwords like `` the perversion of capitalism'' surfaced now and then. Someone in the balcony unfurled a banner that read, `` Smash <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Imperialist Revolution!'' `` Up against the wall!'' hollered members of the audience, invoking the once-familiar phrase to request that a podium be moved away from the movie screen. The crowd applauded <PERSON> Abbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, who wore a tie-dyed T-shirt and sat in the front row, a red bandanna adorning his frizzy gray hair. <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> had helped fuel the strikers' conviction, along with <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON>, now a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> assemblyman, black militants <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rap </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stokely </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmichael </PERSON>, civil rights lawyer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunstler </PERSON>, poet <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginsberg </PERSON> and the Grateful Dead rock band. Many recollections were serious. A few brought laughter: _ A pie tossed in the face of a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> colonel recruiting on campus _ <PERSON> Naison </PERSON> taking his Ph.D. oral exam in a building that was under occupation He passed the exam, and his professors exited through a window. `` It was not a prank or a party, although many have described it as the best time of their lives,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudd </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, who was chairman of Students for a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> in 1968. In the old days, `` We were kids; smart kids _ but kids,'' said ex-protester <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Biberman </PERSON>, 40, now a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> housing lawyer with two children of her own. `` One of the nice things about getting older is that it does mellow some of the hard edges around the anger.'' As students, <PERSON> Rudd </PERSON> said, the protesters were `` intolerant, arrogant, driven and out of touch with reality. Our rage blinded us. ... We allowed the evil we were fighting to penetrate our souls.'' `` We failed to create a permanent, significant left in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Rudd </PERSON> said. Even so, he still is protesting _ this time against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> involvement in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> _ and is writing his autobiography.

<HEAD>Bakker Renews Call To Return To Ministry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT MILL, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> renewed his call Saturday to be allowed to return to <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> to help erase its debts, but ministry officials blamed the former television evangelist for the revocation of its tax-exempt status and other financial problems. The <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> revoked <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s exemption Friday and said contributions to the organization were no longer tax deductible. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and their aides profited excessively from donations to the ministry. The agency also said much of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> theme park in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mill </LOCATION> was commercial rather than ministerial. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, in a telephone call to The Associated Press from his home in <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, acknowledged that he made mistakes, but he denied taking excessive profits and said contributions he convinced people to send built <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s evangelical empire. `` It's typical of the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>. They throw everything at you but the kitchen sink and then ask you to sort it out with documents and vouchers and receipts and defend yourself,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> faces liquidation, so its current leadership should give him another chance. `` Now that it's reached the end of the line and will be broken up, what do they have to lose,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> resigned as leader of the ministry in March 1987 in the midst of a scandal over his sexual encounter with former church secretary <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> in 1980. <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> trustee <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> has said he has no intention of letting <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> return. Ministry officials probably will announce on Monday's `` <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>'' television show their response to the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> action, <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> <PERSON> Leggett </PERSON> said. If <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> appeals, contributions by individuals would be deductible up to $ 1,000 until the appeal is decided, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> said. `` This ruling could have an impact on contributions if people do n't keep their focus on the fact that what we are dealing with here is a legacy that was left by the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Leggett </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> has applied for a new tax-exempt charter and wants to legally separate its ministry functions _ the <ORGANIZATION> daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION> show, satellite network and <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Village </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> _ from its theme park and hotel. There was no indication when the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> would rule. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> says <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> owes more than $ 55 million in taxes from June 1983 to June 1987, the month <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> filed for protection from creditors in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> because of $ 72 million in other debts. Meanwhile, the Rev. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> on Saturday criticized the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> ruling as a `` knee-jerk reaction'' that `` has guaranteed the demise of the ministry.'' <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>, who headed <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> briefly after <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> stepped down, said in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> that the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> should have revoked <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s exemption only for the years <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> headed the ministry.

 A Greek cycling champion pedaled a fragile plane 74 miles over the <LOCATION> Aegean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> sea </LOCATION> Saturday and broke the world record for human-powered flight, but the aircraft was destroyed in a crash landing. A gust of wind snapped the tail boom off the ultralight <ORGANIZATION> Daedalus </ORGANIZATION> 88, which crashed into the sea just 10 yards short of the landing area on the island of <LOCATION> Santorini </LOCATION> more than 3 -LCB- hours after leaving the island of <LOCATION> Crete </LOCATION>. `` It happened in the last moments of the flight and the job was done. I did n't worry about it,'' the athlete-pilot <PERSON> Kanellos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanellopoulos </PERSON> told a news conference in the Greek capital. He was not injured in the crash. `` The situation in the landing area was too rough for this plane, which is built for calm conditions. I was under full control but the tail boom could n't take the pressure,'' said <PERSON> Kanellopoulos </PERSON>, who also broke the records for endurance and straight-line human-powered flight. <PERSON> Kanellopoulos </PERSON>, 31, Greek cycling champion for the past 14 years, was flown to <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> aboard an army helicopter shortly after the rough landing near the black sands of <LOCATION> Perissa </LOCATION> beach on the southeast face of the volcanic island also known as Thira. The 72-pound graphite epoxy and mylar plane, designed by the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, fell after hitting a wind parallel to the beach, said <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION> professor <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Drela </PERSON>, who was in one of the boats following the flight. But <PERSON> Drela </PERSON>, the senior engineer responsible for the plane's aerodynamic design, said the project was `` definitely a success. More than 500 islanders and foreign tourists gathered along the beach to watch the plane, resembling an oversized insect, glide toward the sand. The snapped tail boom caused the plane's huge 112-foot long wings to break, dropping the pink-and-silver aircraft 10 feet into the water. `` I was underwater so I forced my way through the cockpit and dove under the plane. Then I swam to shore,'' the tanned, blond cyclist said. <PERSON> Kanellopoulos </PERSON> pumped the pedals in the nose of the aircraft for 3 hours and 54 minutes to fly from <LOCATION> Heraklion </LOCATION> air base to <LOCATION> Santorini </LOCATION>. He lifted off at 7:06 a.m. -LRB- 12:06 a.m. EDT -RRB- and landed at 11:00 a.m. -LRB- 4 a.m. EDT -RRB-. The flight was intended to emulate the 3,500-year-old myth of <ORGANIZATION> Daedalus </ORGANIZATION>, a Greek architect, sculptor and engineer who flapped his way across the <LOCATION> Aegean </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Crete </LOCATION> on wings of feathers and wax. <ORGANIZATION> Daedalus </ORGANIZATION>' son, Icarus, flew too close to the sun, which melted the wax, causing him to to fall to his death. The previous world record for human-powered flight was set by the Light Eagle, a <ORGANIZATION> Daedalus </ORGANIZATION> 88 prototype piloted by <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Tremml </PERSON>, who flew 37.2 miles around <LOCATION> Edwards </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in January 1987. <PERSON> Kanellopoulos </PERSON> also shattered the record for straight-line human-powered flight set in 1979 by <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, who pedaled the Gossamer Albatross 22 -LCB- miles across the English Channel. The third record broken was for flight duration. The previous mark was held by <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, with a time of 2 hours, 49 minutes. Greek navy and coast guard vessels along with inflatable rescue craft had escorted the plane as it soared 15 feet above the <LOCATION> Aegean </LOCATION>. The flight came after a 36-member team of <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION> experts waited for three weeks on the wind-swept island of <LOCATION> Crete </LOCATION> for a suitable day to attempt the flight. Essential requirements were a calm sea, southerly winds of less than 3 knots, temperatures under 70 degress Fahrenheit and visibility to the horizon, according to <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bussolari </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION> aeronautics professor in charge of flight operations. `` Conditions for the flight were ideal. We even had a southerly tailwind,'' <PERSON> Bussolari </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Pentagon Considering Using Coast Guard Vessels in Persian Gulf</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The deployment of <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> vessels in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> has been raised again at the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official confirmed Saturday night. `` It was the brainchild of the commandant of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> last year and it went nowhere,'' said the official, who asked that he not be identified by name. `` It was raised again last week. I do n't know how serious it is.'' A <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, Maj. <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Morger </PERSON>, said he had no information on the report. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said in its Sunday editions that the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> vessels would assist larger warships in escorting merchant vessels, keeping watch over sea lanes to prevent the laying of mines and guarding offshore installations from attacks by small craft. The vessels also would free larger ships from routine patrols, the paper said. The Times quoted unidentified <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials as saying they did not know how many or precisely what kind of <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> vessels would be sent if <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> approved the plan. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> is eager to assume a role in the gulf operations, officials told the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. The idea of using <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> vessels had been proposed last October but was rejected by then <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration expanded its naval presence in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> last summer at the request of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, an ally of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in the 7 -LCB- - year Iran-Iraq war which had seen its tankers become special targets of Iranian attack President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, saying it was essential to protect freedom of navigation in international waters, announced the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> would protect any Kuwaiti-owned tankers that were re-registered to fly the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag. Ultimately, 11 Kuwaiti ships were re-flagged. On Friday, administration officials said the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has decided to expand its policy to allow <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships to aid neutral merchant ships under attack. The change resulted from the mining of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> frigate <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> on April 14 and last Monday's extensive fighting between Iranian and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces, the officials said. In that fighting, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces sank or crippled six Iranian vessels that challenged them after they destroyed two offshore platforms in retaliation for the mining of the Roberts. Despite the change in policy, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> hopes that it can avoid the assignment of additional ships to the gulf, the officials said. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> recently has deployed the following numbers and types of ships in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>: two command ships, one cruiser, one destroyer, six frigates, six mine-sweepers, and an amphibious landing ship. The department announced last week that the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> was deploying 13 ships to the gulf region but said it was part of a long-planned and routine series of rotations. <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said he announced the ship movements to head off speculation that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had decided to increase the size of its <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> force.

 Rescue workers searching through the rubble of a grain elevator Saturday found the bodies of the last of five people killed in an explosion a day earlier, police said. Three bodies were discovered within half an hour of each other late Saturday afternoon by rescue workers digging through debris, corn and soybeans in the basement of the elevator, said police detective <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Horvath </PERSON>. `` There were five people unaccounted for and we have recovered all five,'' said <LOCATION> Joliet </LOCATION> Police Captain <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Grace </PERSON>. The three victims apparently had been in an office area of the elevator when it exploded and were found under `` a whole roomful of grain,'' <PERSON> Grace </PERSON> said. Authorities at first believed that another person had been blown into the river from a barge by the force of the explosion, but <PERSON> Grace </PERSON> said they no longer believe that report. He added, however, that rescue workers are continuing their search in the area `` just as a precaution.'' Two bodies were recovered Friday after the two explosions flattened four solos and an office building at the <ORGANIZATION> ADM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Growmark </ORGANIZATION> granary, about 40 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` This is just one of those tragic things that should never happen,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, whose 20-year-old son, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON>, was killed in Friday's explosions. `` He was a good son, and I loved him,'' said <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, a farmer from Anchor, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, whose son had been a trainee at the site as part of a program at <ORGANIZATION> Joliet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Junior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. The tragedy was especially horrifying for the family of <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Slatton </PERSON>, 28, of <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, whose younger brother was killed in a car accident 10 months ago. `` It's totally devastating to have three sons and to lose two,'' said the victim's mother, <PERSON> Carol </PERSON>. `` To lose any is a tragedy. ... Now, this is something we have to go through again.'' After toiling overnight, workers using bulldozers and cranes had cleared about 50 percent of the debris strewn over the site by the explosions, said an official at the <ORGANIZATION> Joliet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> command post at the site who would not identify himself. Authorities suspect grain dust may have caused the first explosion, which apparently ruptured a natural gas main about 11 a.m. and touched off a second blast moments later, said <LOCATION> Joliet </LOCATION> Fire Chief <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Plese </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Plese </PERSON> said Saturday that the exact cause would be hard to determine. `` We have no idea what caused the explosions ... and due to that much destruction it will be very hard to try to pinpoint anything, but we're going to try to make that attempt,'' he said. The bodies recovered Saturday were identified as those of <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zack </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Joliet </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON>, 18, of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dupuis </PERSON>, 23, of <PERSON> Bourbonnais </PERSON>, said <LOCATION> Will </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Deputy Coroner <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON>. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Munchalfen </PERSON>, a security guard, said there had been four silos at the site, and only a sheet-metal covered grain dryer remained standing. One of the silos crushed an adjacent one-story office building.

 A rooftop parking area collapsed Saturday during the grand opening of a grocery store, dropping automobiles and blocks of concrete onto store displays and injuring 21 people, police said. It was not immediately known how many people were in the <LOCATION> Save-on-Foods </LOCATION> store when the parking area, holding about 22 autos, collapsed, but <ORGANIZATION> Constable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mounted </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Burnaby </LOCATION> said estimates ran as high as 900. Many were elderly people being given a preview tour. Three of the injured were admitted to hospitals, with one in serious condition. Police used cranes to remove huge blocks of concrete and cars that fell about 40 feet from the parking area to the floor of the store, in the Metrotown shopping center, Mounted Police Constable <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Muir </PERSON> said. It took several hours for searchers, who used police dogs, to get through the rubble. Officials believed everyone was accounted for, <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said. `` We're being optimistic there wo n't be any deaths,'' said Mounted Police Sgt. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Schauer </PERSON>. `` But we're still going through the rubble.'' Some cars were piled on each other on the supermarket floor amid soda and produce displays, while above, other autos teetered on the edge of a hole about half the size of a football field. `` I heard a crack and I looked up and saw the center beam wobble and saw the floor from the parking garage come down so I immediately told people to get outside,'' said one witness, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanderson </PERSON>. `` As soon as the first crack came -LRB- in the beam -RRB-, they started getting people out,'' <PERSON> Heppell </PERSON> said. The collapse was preceded by the sound of a buckling beam and spray from a bursting water pipe, officials said. There were three warnings over the store's loudspeaker system to clear the area. <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Heppell </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Overwaitea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION>, which operates the store chain, said a structural failure caused the cave-in. Eight people were taken to a hospital by ambulance, and others went to emergency wards on their own. `` The staff was well-organized but we had some problems with the customers,'' said meatcutter <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, 38. `` They did n't appear to be trying to move too fast. `` They were still checking out our prices. It's amazing how some people react.'' Free-lance photographer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, who was taking pictures of the preview event, said many thought it was a joke that a water pipe should burst in a brand new supermarket. `` Then I could see that the roof was bent and old this older man that the roof was going to go. `` I'd just turned my back for one second and down it came. There was suddenly a tremendous gust of wind at my back as I ran,'' he said. `` Suddenly everybody was in shock. Everybody was stunned. And some of the people were really freaked out.''

<HEAD>Congressional Report Says Star Wars Would Fail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An unpublished congressional report says President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s proposed missile defense system known as Star Wars likely would `` suffer a catastrophic failure'' the first time it was used, the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday. The first time would therefore be the only time it was used to protect the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> against a <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> nuclear attack, the newspaper said. The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said the conclusions are contained in a report by the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assessment </ORGANIZATION>, a nonpartisan scientific arm of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> which studied <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Strategic Defense Initiative for the past two years. The <ORGANIZATION> OTA </ORGANIZATION> says in the report that the detailed computer instructions needed to destroy thousands of warheads streaking towards the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> probably can not `` be produced in the foreseeable future,'' according to the newspaper, which said it obtained a copy of the report's summary chapter. The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said the report also says that the timetable for missile defense deployment in the mid-1990s established by SDI officials requires `` an act of faith'' in assuming that the system could indefinitely stop a substantial portion of Soviet missiles because there is no scientific evidence to date to support the assumption. The conclusions are among the principal findings of a 900-page report on SDI prepared by the <ORGANIZATION> OTA </ORGANIZATION>'s staff, which was given access to classified SDI data and drew advice from an expert panel containing SDI supporters and opponents. Public release of an unclassified version of the report has been withheld for seven months by <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials, who say it contains sensitive information, the paper said. Although three of the report's chapters remain in dispute, <ORGANIZATION> SDI </ORGANIZATION> officials last month cleared nine others, including the summary chapter obtained by the Post. The OTA report's overall conclusion is that, despite five years and $ 12 billion worth of scientific research, `` many questions remain about the feasibility of meeting SDI goals,'' which include at the outset substantial disruption of a Soviet missile attack and in later stages, `` elimination of the threat posed'' by Soviet missiles, the paper said. Noting that the nation `` would not want to base a major change in its nuclear strategy on a -LRB- missile defense -RRB- ... in which it had little confidence,'' the <ORGANIZATION> OTA </ORGANIZATION> report cautioned that the system's sheer complexity suggested `` there would always be irresolvable questions about how dependable ... -LRB- the computer -RRB- software was. the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Extrapolating from past experience ... it appears to OTA that the complexity of -LRB- ballistic missile defense -RRB-, the uncertainty ... of the requirements it must meet, and the novelty of the technology it must control would impose a significant probability of software-induced catastrophic failure in the system's first real battle,'' the newspaper quoted the report as saying.

 Just a week after announcing plans for a half-hour nightly news program, the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monitor </ORGANIZATION> says it will publish a new monthly magazine, `` World Monitor.'' The first issue of the glossy, four-color monthly will appear in September, at the same time the TV show begins. The magazine will include articles on world news, politics, the arts, economics, culture and personalities with what is described as a `` global focus.'' `` We're hoping to throw a life preserver to people who are drowning in a tidal wave of facts, info, dis-info and mis-info,'' said `` World Monitor'' Editor in Chief <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Foell </PERSON>, who is also editor of the Christian Science Monitor, flagship of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, associate publisher of `` World Monitor,'' said marketing studies found there was a demand for the `` big-picture'' journalism that both the television show and magazine will offer. `` We saw that the newsweekly concept was being covered well but that many people wanted more than headline type news,'' said <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>.

 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> mine sweepers detonated mines Friday that were found earlier in the week near an offshore Iranian oil platform in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and shipping executives reported. In another development, officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has decided to permit <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> warships in the gulf to intervene with force to help neutral merchant vessels that are attacked. Their orders have been to offer only humanitarian assistance. Shipping executives said three mines were detonated Friday but <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, speaking privately, said mine sweepers examined and destroyed five mines. They said the explosives carried serial numbers indicating <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> manufactured them. The mines were spotted by a French warship Tuesday near the <LOCATION> Sassan </LOCATION> oil platform about 80 miles from the <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION> peninsula. The area was declared a navigational hazard and commercial vessels were warned to stay away. <ORGANIZATION> Sassan </ORGANIZATION> is one of two Iranian platforms the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> destroyed Monday in retaliation for a mine explosion that damaged the frigate <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> last week and wounded 10 sailors. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and other nations' mine sweepers have worked all week to clear a mine field about 70 miles northeast of where the mines were detonated Friday. That field is in a main shipping channel for reflagged Kuwaiti tankers escorted by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships. Escort operations, which began last July, have been suspended until the mines are cleared. At least three of the 11 Kuwaiti tankers given <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flags and registration were anchored outside the gulf Friday. Under the new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships no longer would be instructed to stay away when <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> attacks merchant ships sailing under other flags. If a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> warship observed an Iranian raid and was close enough to intervene it would have the authority to do so, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` It's a random, target-of-opportunity approach designed to throw the Iranians off guard,'' one said. A Capitol Hill official briefed on the matter Friday said: `` This will give a lot of authority to local commanders and a lot of leeway to do as they see fit.'' Another official said: `` Our purpose is not to get into a war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Our purpose is to secure safe passage for neutral shipping moving back and forth between neutral ports.'' They said the policy change does not extend <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military protection to convoys of foreign-flag ships. Only ships flying the American flag will be entitled to `` door-to-door protection'' in convoys, one official said.

<TEXT>
 A week of U.S.-Soviet talks on the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> fishery that included discussion of a possible ban on fishing in the so-called `` doughnut hole,'' ended Friday with only a promise of additional meetings. `` It was a good first meeting,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s ambassador for oceans and fisheries who headed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation. `` We agreed this was going to be an exploratory meeting and we exchanged views.'' <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> said no agreement was reached on a fishing moratorium in the `` doughnut hole,'' a 4,500-square mile area in the center of the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> that is one of the richest fishing grounds in the world. <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> declined further comment, adding only that such a fishing ban was discussed. `` We will continue to discuss this issue,'' said <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>, adding that he would brief members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> next week. The two sides agreed to meet again in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> later this spring. <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> shares <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concerns that foreign trawlers may be overfishing the `` doughnut hole'' and that could cause a decline in the catch in the American and Soviet fishing zones that surround the area. The catch by foreign vessels, including those from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, has risen from roughly 200,000 metric tons in 1984 to more than 1 million metric tons in 1987. According to a joint statement issued after the negotiations ended, both sides agreed to `` develop further cooperation between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the exercise of their rights and duties under international law to coordinate conservation and management'' of fishing in the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. Earlier this year, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> overhwelmingly approved a resolution calling on the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to negotiate a fishing moratorium in the `` doughnut hole.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote came in the wake of the videotapping by American fishermen of seven Japanese trawlers fishing illegally in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> waters off <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on Friday accused <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> of state terrorism in the assassination of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s military commander. `` It is but another example of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s cynical contempt for world public opinion,'' Soviet Ambassador <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Belonogov </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Belonogov </PERSON> also called the slaying `` another act of the policy of state terrorism which has long been practiced by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, which requested the council meeting, wants <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> condemned for the assassination of <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON> at his home in suburban <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> last Saturday. Tunisian officials and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> sources say <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> commandos gunned down <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>, also known as <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jihad </PERSON>. Officially, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has neither confirmed nor denied the allegations. In a carefully worded statement issued Thursday by the Israeli mission to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, the Jewish state denied it `` admitted'' the attack, as <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> claimed. The Soviets joined a growing list of nations condemning <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for the assassination. Most have singled it out by name. A few, such as <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, have not. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s ambassador, <PERSON> Hideo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kagami </PERSON>, noted the absence of firm proof against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kagami </PERSON> said any condemnation `` must be based on solid and irrefutable evidence.'' Many diplomats said they expected <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to veto <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>'s resolution, as it has several resolutions on the unrest considered by the council recently. They said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vote hinged on the wording of the resolution. A direct condemnation of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was sure to be vetoed, but a general condemnation of political assassination might survive, said the diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity. A vote was expected Monday. Dozens of nations have joined the debate, including many accused of sponsoring terrorism, such as <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. Many speakers told the council the slaying further hampers the prospects of a settlement between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> neighbors. `` The shots in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> are shots against peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>,'' said Yugoslav Ambassador <PERSON> Dragoslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Pejic </PERSON>. A number of speakers told <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>'s death will not end the Palestinian unrest since Dec. 8 in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> that has left 171 Palestinians and two Israelis dead. <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>, who grew up in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, was the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> coordinator for the uprising. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has issued orders for a `` Day of Rage'' in the Israeli-occupied terrorities Saturday to avenge <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>, according to a leaflet circulating in the area.

 News reports Friday said an <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> government investigation has concluded that an unarmed civilian fatally wounded near a British army checkpoint in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> was killed by a ricocheting bullet. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> would not confirm the report. <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> newspaper quoted police sources as saying the investigation found that a ricocheting bullet killed <PERSON> Aidan </PERSON> <PERSON> McAnespie </PERSON>, 23, on Feb. 21 at the checkpoint in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> near the border with the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. Press Association, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s domestic news agency, also quoted police sources as saying the inquiry had determined that the shooting was not deliberate. The British army has said it was an accident. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> was angered by the decision by the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> government to investigate the shooting, calling it interference in the affairs of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> province. An 18-year-old British soldier, Pvt. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Holden </PERSON>, is being held in military custody while awaiting trial on charges of unlawfully killing <PERSON> McAnespie </PERSON>. Irish police spokesman <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that the investigation headed by <ORGANIZATION> Deputy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowley </PERSON> had been concluded but he could not comment on its results. A spokesman for Irish Justice Minister <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> had been given the report and `` it will be considered by the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> at a future date.'' The shooting occurred at a checkpoint near <LOCATION> Auchnacloy </LOCATION>, a County <PERSON> Tyrone </PERSON> town half a mile from the border. <PERSON> McAnespie </PERSON> was an election worker for <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, the legal political arm of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. The British army said he was killed by a ricocheting bullet after a machine gun was fired accidentally from the observation post. <PERSON> McAnespie </PERSON>'s family and <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> leaders in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> claimed that <PERSON> McAnespie </PERSON> had been regularly harassed by British soldiers on his way to and from work across the border. Irish Prime Minister <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON> challenged the army's version, saying the suggestion that the shooting was an accident `` must give rise to disbelief.

<HEAD>Surrogate Mother Of Twins Says Couple Told Her: Keep The Boy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>IONIA, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Patty </PERSON> <PERSON> Nowakowski </PERSON> says she agreed to be a surrogate mother and gave birth to a boy and a girl, only to find that the couple wanted just the girl. Now the twins, not yet 3 weeks old, live separately because the couple who hired her did n't want the boy. After some hesitation, she and her husband, <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON>, have decided to raise the boy themselves and have named him <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nowakowski </PERSON>, 27, told her story this week to a special legislative panel looking into surrogacy contracts. `` I was not aware of how carelessly the program is run,'' the woman said. `` When I entered into it, I thought it would be a wonderful thing to do for someone else, to help them have a family. I never dreamed it would turn out this way.'' The babies were born under a $ 10,000 contract arranged by <PERSON> Noel </PERSON> <PERSON> Keane </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Dearborn </LOCATION> attrney who specializes in surrogate birth agreements. <PERSON> Keane </PERSON> arranged <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON>'s surrogate pregnancy, which resulted in a protracted legal battle in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> known as the `` Baby M'' case. <PERSON> Keane </PERSON> said he did not know of a couple ever having rejected a surrogate baby because of its sex, and would not discuss the specifics of the <PERSON> Nowakowski </PERSON> contract. <PERSON> Nowakowski </PERSON> was given fertility drugs and became pregnant at the first artificial insemination last July. She said she learned she was carrying twins, and underwent a procedure to determine the sex of the babies. The test showed that one baby was a boy, but the sex of the other could not be determined. Two weeks before the twins were born, the other couple, who already had children, told her a doctor had recommended against adding more children to their family because of the added stress. `` They had decided they did not want the boy,'' <PERSON> Nowakowski </PERSON> said in an interview Thursday with The Grand Rapids Press. But the couple told her that if the other baby was a girl, they would take her. `` At that point, I did not know what to do. I was very angry,'' <PERSON> Nowakowski </PERSON> said. `` It put us in a bad position.'' <PERSON> Nowakowski </PERSON> said she and her husband, who have three other children, thought they would put up the babies for adoption if they were both boys. When the babies were born in a Lansing hospital, the couple came and took the baby girl. The boy was sent to a foster home. But that bothered <PERSON> Nowakowski </PERSON>, and she and her husband ended up taking <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> home. `` It did n't seem fair to him, that he was rejected by his biological father, then rejected again by his surrogate parents. How can you make a child enter the world as a product of rejection?''

<HEAD>Peru and Ecuador Protest Coup Statement by U.S. Official</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> on Friday demanded an explanation from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government after a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official was quoted as saying that <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> face the threat of military coups. <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>'s interior minister, <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> Moeller </PERSON>, also assailed the statements attributed to <PERSON> Elliot </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> affairs, that were published in the Argentine newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nacion </ORGANIZATION> earlier this week. <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Nacion </PERSON> said that in the interview conducted in <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> was asked about threats to fragile Latin American democracies.

It added: `` Apart from being intrinsically erroneous, those declarations constitute inadmissible interference in internal matters that deserves our energetic rejection.'' <PERSON> Moeller </PERSON> said Thursday, `` Mr. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> is damaging the democratic process with his declarations.'' There was no comment from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassies in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Quito </LOCATION>. There are occasional rumors of possible coups in both Andean nations, which are suffering severe economic problems. <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> also is battling left-wing rebels in a revolt that has claimed more than 10,000 lives since 1980. Peruvian congressmen from various political parties discarded the chances of a military coup against the centrist government of President <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>. Political leaders in <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> also dimissed the possibility of a coup against conservative President <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Febres </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordero </PERSON>.

 <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> on Friday accused South Korean soldiers of firing across the demilitarized zone separating the two enemies and destroying equipment. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> denied the report. A report by the <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, said the soldiers fired on a North Korean post in <LOCATION> Changpung </LOCATION>, an area northeast of <LOCATION> Kaesong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, on Thursday evening. `` The reckless bombardment seriously threatened the safety of civil policemen of our side on routine duty and destroyed facilities of the -LRB- guard -RRB- post,'' the report said. `` It was entirely due to the patience of our side that the incident did not expand into an armed conflict between the two sides.'' South Korean defense officials said they were investigating. The North also accused <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> of setting a fire Sunday that burned nearly 3,000 acres on <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>'s side of the DMZ.

<TEXT>
 The government disclosed Friday that there are 158 people in jail for refusing to serve in the military under the law that makes 18 months of service compulsory. Some church leaders and dissidents had demanded that communist authorities say how many conscientious objectors are imprisoned. The official <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> news agency quoted government spokesman <PERSON> Reszo </PERSON> <PERSON> Banyas </PERSON> as saying at a news conference Friday there are currently 158 conscientious objectors in jail.

<HEAD>Shamir's Office Predicts New Period In Israeli-Soviet Ties</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A secret report prepared by a team of specialists from Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s office said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is facing a new and improved period in its troubled relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television said it obtained details of the report and quoted it on Friday as predicting `` a qualitative change'' in Israeli-Soviet ties. The study was completed this week and was based on various materials pertaining to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, open as well as classified, and on an analysis of the Kremlin's latest contacts with the Arab countries and the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, the television report said without attribution. Officials from <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s office were not available for comment. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and all East European countries except <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> broke ties with the Jewish State following the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. In 1986 and 1987, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> reestablished low-level diplomatic ties with <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. Last July, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> sent a consular delegation to <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, the first Soviet diplomatic group to visit <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 20 years. A similar Israeli group was expected to travel to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> this month, but its visas have been delayed, according to <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials. The specialists' report said the Soviets may now make serious concessions to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, including the issue of the emigration of Soviet Jews, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television said but it gave not details. Soviet leaders recently permitted increased Jewish emigration, which reached a 15-month high of 984 in March. Dozens of Soviet Jews, including some who have been denied exit visas, have been allowed to visit relatives in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in recent months. Some <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> immigrants from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> were permitted to visit their families in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The television broadcast quoted the report as saying the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> may change its pattern of contacts with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> while taking into account <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s close ties with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. According to the broadcast account, the report predicted an intensive period of Soviet peace-making activity in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and said it may result in an official visit of Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> during his upcoming <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> trip. The study reportedly noted that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> is undertaking a consistent course of restoring friendly relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> while demanding more diplomatic flexibility from the Arab states. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has said the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> conflicts should be resolved by an international conference and the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> should participate in peace talks. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is not ready to accept the participation of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which it views as a terrorist group. It also has said the Soviets must restore diplomatic ties and increase Jewish emigration before playing any major role in peace talks. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, head of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, opposes the proposal for an international conference, which would include the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as one of the five permanent members of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> could be isolated at such a forum and forced to make territorial concessions on the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s political rival, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, has said an international conference is the only way to prepare for peace talks with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> neighbors. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, head of the socialist <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, expressed optimism Friday about possible Soviet involvement. Asked to comment on talks by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> over the last two days in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said: `` We still do n't know the results of the meeting. But there is one issue from which we may learn something: It's <LOCATION> Afganistan </LOCATION>. It was a very severe case of regional conflict and the superpowers agreed on how to stop it positively.'' But <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> could not persuade the Soviets to restore diplomatic ties with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> or pledge to increase Jewish emigration, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> said. The harsh tone of official Soviet statements also contrasted with the reportedly optimistic study conducted by <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s office. On Friday, the Soviets accused <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> of state terrorism in the killing of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> military chief <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON> last week in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>. `` It is but another example of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s cynical contempt for the world public opinion,'' Soviet Ambassador <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Belonogov </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. He called the killing `` another act of the policy of state terrorism which has long been practiced by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.''

 Leftist guerrillas assassinated two governing party mayors, burned a textile factory and bombed government and political party offices in rural districts, police reported Friday. Most of the attacks were blamed on rebels of the Maoist Shining Path movement. The government places the death toll at more than 10,000 since the Shining Path began its violent campaign to overthrow the government eight years ago. Police and government officials gave these reports of the latest violence: Rebels on Friday shot to death <PERSON> Isidoro </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, the mayor of <LOCATION> Socabaya </LOCATION> 545 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. The day before, gunmen killed the mayor of the village <LOCATION> Macachacra </LOCATION> 210 miles southeast of the capital. About 15 rebels seized the Cerro Alegre textile factory near <LOCATION> Canete </LOCATION>, 85 miles south of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, before dawn Friday. They forced more than 20 workers and security guards to flee and then tossed incendiary bombs into the plant. The fire blazed for six hours, destroying bails of cotton worth thousands of dollars. A car bomb exploded Friday outside an <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Chiclayo </LOCATION>, 465 miles north of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, and a dynamite bomb went off in front of the headquarters of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Aprista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Huaraz </LOCATION> 190 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. No injuries were reported in the bombings and the attack on the textile factory. Police blamed the the pro-Cuba Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement for the bombing in <LOCATION> Chiclayo </LOCATION> and said about 100 people were detained for questioning. No arrests were repored in the other attacks.

That puts him at odds with analysts at some of Wall Street's most prominent brokerage firms, who argue that the current mood of fear and pessimism is setting the stage for higher stock prices <PERSON> Gailliot </PERSON> agrees rallies usually exhaust themselves only when they have attracted a large following of true believers. `` I'd like to see more enthusiasm at the top,'' he acknowledges. Nevertheless, he says, spotting the precise moment when such an event occurs is a very difficult and chancy assignment. And, he adds, `` the easy money in the rally has already been made.'' Gailliot bases his reasoning on an appraisal of the `` character'' of the market's rise from its lows late last year. In the aftermath of the October crash, <PERSON> Gailliot </PERSON> asserted that stock prices were almost certain to rebound. However, he added at the time, the upswing itself would have to be watched for a while to see whether it looked like only a passing phenomenon or something more durable. By April 13, he concluded the rally had flunked that test. In its early stages, the market's rise produced a strong plurality of individual stocks rising in price vs. those that declined. But these `` very positive breadth characteristics'' have `` deteriorated significantly in the last month,'' he said. Meanwhile, volume of stock trading has contracted as prices have risen, he observed. `` That is a classic bear-market characteristic,'' he said. In spite of all the recent signs of strength in the economy, <PERSON> Gailliot </PERSON> believes a recession is lurking in the not-too-distant future. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> is being forced back into its old position of fighting inflation and defending the dollar,'' he says. `` One must remember that about one-third of all recessions are not predictable. We only know after the fact.'' But while he believes the portents are bad for stocks, <PERSON> Gailliot </PERSON> takes a far more upbeat view of the outlook for bonds: `` A bull market in bonds began on Black Monday,'' when 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds were yielding about 10.4 percent. From that point, prices rose and yields fell to about 8.3 percent several weeks ago. Since then, they have climbed back up to 9 percent, creating what <PERSON> Gailliot </PERSON> views as `` another opportunity to buy.'' Once the recession he expects manifests itself and becomes widely recognized, he maintains, the yield on long-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds could get as low as 6 percent. The recession will eventually set the stage for a new bull market that could cap off the 1980s as a true `` decade for financial assets,'' <PERSON> Gailliot </PERSON> says, but he views the investment outlook for the 1990s as less certain. By then, he says, the nation will have stretched its habit of deficit spending, of consuming more than it produces, to an important limit. At that point, he says, the world's financial markets will provide the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with only enough money to carry its existing debts, rather than to expand them. When that happens, he says, the nation will be forced into making tough choices about how to deal with its domestic and international deficits, and the choices it makes will go a long way toward determining the financial shape of the 1990s.

<HEAD>Vietnam Reconciling with Churches but Vatican Ties Still Strained</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ENG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HANOI, Vietnam (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The communist government has taken significant steps toward reconciliation with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s Roman Catholic and <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> minorities, but it remains in serious dispute with the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. The Vietnamese authorities object to <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> plans to canonize 117 people, including 11 Spaniards and 10 Frenchmen, who died at the hands of Vietnamese rulers in the 18th and 19th centuries. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> holds the victims to be martyrs who died in a period of repression of Catholicism, but <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> maintains they were agents of French colonialism. <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> says it does not oppose the canonization as such, but objects to the way it says Vietnamese abroad have seized on it to make it an anti-communist political issue. `` This canonization is not any more a religious affair,'' Vu Thai Hoa, an official of the government's <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Religious Affairs, said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The martyrs were beatified earlier this century as the first step toward sainthood. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> was a French colony at the time. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> announced the canonization last June and the elevations are scheduled to take place this June 19. <PERSON> Hoa </PERSON> charged that the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> never consulted with <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> about the canonization. He said those to be canonized include Frenchmen who invaded the country disguised as missionaries. <PERSON> Hoa </PERSON> added that in the documents promoting the cause of sainthood, the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> should delete charges that Vietnamese authorities have persecuted the church for 300 years. He also said references to Republic of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> _ the name of the pre-1975 government in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> _ should be changed to the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s current official name, <LOCATION> Socialist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. He also said <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> also wants the the date of the ceremony changed because June 19 was the army holiday of the old <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnamese </LOCATION> government, which the North Vietnamese and <ORGANIZATION> Viet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cong </ORGANIZATION> defeated in 1975. <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>'s main concern, however, appears to be that thousands of the estimated 1 million overseas Vietnamese will stage protests at the ceremony to be officiated by Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peter </ORGANIZATION>'s Basilica and call on Catholics in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to oppose their government `` They are preparing <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> flags and anti-communist posters for the occasion,'' <PERSON> Hoa </PERSON> said. Vietnamese officials also are concerned that this may be the first step in an attempt to set up a church in exile. -LRB- A <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> source, speaking on condition of anonmyity, said protests wo n't be permitted at the ceremony but added that the documents of sainthood were prepared long ago and ca n't be changed. The date was `` pure coincidence,'' the source said, adding that the ceremony was to have been June 26 but had to be changed because Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> had another commitment. -RRB- <PERSON> Hoa </PERSON> said about 2,500 Catholic priests and 5 million Catholics remain in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, along with about 400 <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> pastors and 200,000 Protestants. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> is a mainly Buddhist country of 63 million people. Vietnamese emperors executed some Catholics after the first missionaries began arriving in the late 16th century. American missionaries brought Protestantism to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> early this century. Hundreds of thousands of Catholics streamed south when the country was divided in 1954 into the communist North and non-communist South. Many fled the country after the communists reunified it in 1975. Protestants and <PERSON> Catholics </PERSON> were perceived as having backed not only the French, but later <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and its ally, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> had official relations. The Vietnamese <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader, <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Linh </PERSON>, who came to power in December 1986, has called for an end to discrimination against <PERSON> Catholics </PERSON>, saying they have a valuable role to play in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s development. Since then, dozens of priests, many of them military chaplains or otherwise associated with the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> government, were freed from so-called political re-education camps the communists established after winning the war. <PERSON> Hoa </PERSON> said almost all priests have now been released. In February 1987, authorities reopened in <LOCATION> Ho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Minh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, formerly <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION>, the first Catholic seminary since all of them were closed by 1982. This past February officials permitted the opening in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>, the nation's capital, the first Protestant seminary since the last previous one was closed in 1976. <PERSON> Hoa </PERSON> said two more Catholic seminaries probably will be opened by year's end. Last year, two Vietnamese Catholic prelates were allowed to attend the Worldwide Synod of Bishops at the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>, and the head of the Protestant church in northern <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> was permitted to go to <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> for a church congress. Priests also have been freer to travel inside <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and to talk with foreigners. There are signs, too, that churches will be allowed to resume social welfare work, such as in schools and orphanages, a move likely to bring more aid from Christian relief agencies in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. In November, government officials met with <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> relief agency officials from 13 Western countries. Suspicions remain, however, that the government is actually trying to co-opt church leaders rather than allow more freedom. The archbishop of Hue, the Rev. <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dien </PERSON>, remains under house arrest for opposing a state-supervised organization for priests. The Rev. <PERSON> Tran </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinh </PERSON> <PERSON> Thu </PERSON>, who is 81 years old, has been sentenced to life in prison after his conviction of printing propaganda and training dissidents in his Ho Chi Minh City church.

<HEAD>Gephardt and Prestowitz Say Trade Bill Not Tough Enough</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The trade bill that emerged from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> this past week was too strong for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, but it was too weak for <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Prestowitz </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> insiders say the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must go even farther to force other nations to open their markets to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> products and protect vital <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industries from unfair competition. Government needs to have a master plan for managing foreign trade, say the people who are sometimes described as `` economic nationalists.'' According to their theory, Americans are only kidding themselves by clinging to the idea that other nations will spontaneously drop their trade barriers out of enlightened self-interest. In fact, they say, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has made a national policy of protecting its domestic industries while picking off American industries one at a time. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which reigned supreme at the end of World War II, foolishly allowed its economic power to deteriorate at the same time it was spending billions on its military, the argument goes. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> ran for president on this platform, and the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman continues to believe that the public agrees with him despite his early exit from the Democratic race. He says he was held back in the presidential primaries only by a lack of money to get his message across. Now comes <PERSON> Prestowitz </PERSON> to add meat to the bones of the argument with a book called, `` Trading Places: How We Allowed <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to Take the Lead'' -LRB- Basic Books, 365 pages -RRB-. <PERSON> Prestowitz </PERSON> started the book in 1986 after quitting the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, where he was the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s chief negotiator on trade with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Endorsers of the book include such high-technology business leaders as <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Packard </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Prestowitz </PERSON> says people who oppose government involvement in trade and industry need to recognize that the government is already intimately involved in both areas, only in an inefficient and unplanned way `` We do manage trade, but because we kind of back into it and say that we're not _ winking _ we come up with the worst of all possible worlds. We protect industries that are practically corpses without doing anything to rebuild them,'' <PERSON> Prestowitz </PERSON> said in a recent interview. No more than 10 percent of world trade is fully free now, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative's office has estimated. Even the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has import limits, `` voluntary'' or otherwise, on cars, steel, textiles and semiconductors. `` Let's be honest,'' <PERSON> Prestowitz </PERSON> said. `` Let's recognize what we're doing and let's proceed in a way that gives us more benefits.'' <PERSON> Prestowitz </PERSON> praises the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's semiconductor accord with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, which he said made it clear that the government would not let the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chip industry go down the drain. That public assurance, which is rare in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> but common in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, gave companies like <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> the sense of security they needed to make a huge investment in returning to production of memory chips. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, in an interview Friday, said <PERSON> Prestowitz </PERSON> `` performed a great service by writing this book. Thre's no one in the country who's had more epxierience in trying to get fair trade than <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Prestowitz </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> was the only Democrat in the House who voted against the trade bill this past Thursday because he thought it was too weak. -LRB- One other Democratic dissenter, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mrazek </PERSON>, thought the bill was too strong. -RRB- Fear is one reason many leaders in government and industry hold back from more aggressive trading practices, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> believes: `` Fear that if you disagree with somebody, as we disagree with the Russians all the time, that we'll be accused of unfairness, of racism.'' In fact, the House-passed trade bill was reviled as `` anti-Japanese'' on Friday by <PERSON> Hajime </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamura </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s minister of international trade and industry, according to <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, `` anti-Japanese'' is almost the same as `` racist.'' The trade bill is the most comprehensive trade legislation since 1974 and garnered 24 more votes than the two-thirds necessary to override a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> veto. A vote in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is expected Tuesday. The most attention-getting portion of the bill was one that had almost nothing to do with trade: a provision requiring 60 days' notice of a plant-closing or long-term layoff by companies employing more than 100 people More significant was a provision requiring investigation of countries with `` pervasive'' unfair trade practices. The government could retaliate if the barriers were not eliminated. Similarly, industries seriously injured by imports could get protection if they were willing to make a `` positive adjustment'' to foreign competition. Free traders say the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is largely to blame for its failure to penetrate foreign markets.

 The story of the stock market's behavior over the past couple of months has been a whole lot of motion and very little progress. Wide swings stretching over a few days or even a few hours have been commonplace. Yet a glance back to mid-February shows most of the popular market indicators barely changed from where they stood then. As they survey this situation, many observers see the market caught in a classic dilemma. Short-term volatility in stock prices in the aftermath of last year's crash, they agree, has frightened away many individual investors and money managers at investing institutions. But the presence of those same investors may be required if volatility is going to be reduced. In the meantime, many Wall Streeters lament a market climate that seems given over almost entirely to players with a gimmick _ a takeover rumor, a matched set of buy and sell orders keyed to an impending dividend payment, or a computer program `` index arbitrage'' transaction. The outcry over program trading was raised again on Thursday when the market rose sharply in early trading, took an abrupt drop at midafternoon and then bounced back again at the close to finish little changed. There seemed to be no fundamental reasons for all these sudden swings, other than fluctuations in stock index futures that kept changing the equations on which program trading is based. The situation has been described as `` the tail wagging the dog.'' But <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, head equity trader at <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, says that description does n't go far enough. `` It has the dog by the tail and is whipping it around in the air,'' he says. Defenders of program trading contend that, by serving an arbitrage function of keeping prices in line between the futures and `` cash'' markets, the practice actually serves as a stabilizing influence over time. But King says that argument glosses over `` the dirty little secret of program trading.'' `` Derivative-product traders need volatility to prosper. If they do n't have it, they try to manufacture it,'' he said. `` They move into positions, and when the conditions are right they try to ` influence' prices. `` Instead of providing liquidity, they aggravate the movement in the direction of the trend.'' At the close on Friday, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials stood at 2,015.09, up 1.16 from the week before. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite index rose .03 to 147.03; the <ORGANIZATION> NASDAQ </ORGANIZATION> composite index for the over-the-counter market gained .14 to 374.04; and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> market value index slipped 1.21 to 298.03. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> averaged 155.02 million shares a day, against 183.57 million the week before. The short-term trading mentality prevading the Street these days also came under attack on April 14, when disappointing news on the trade deficit touched off a 101.46-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average. What sense could it make, many people asked, to chop $ 100 billion off the value of stocks on the basis of a single statistic for just one month, which may or may not be reliable and could well be substantially revised in the next monthly report? But longtime observers of the markets say such behavior is n't really as irrational as it looks After all, they say, professional traders are n't in the business of contemplative analysis. They are engaged in trying to outwit each other on a battleground that is constantly shifting. `` The latest number is new, additional information, even if it is often unreliable,'' observed <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` This information either fits preconceived notions or challenges them. Arguments may be buttressed and markets moved.''

<HEAD>High Court Ruling Seen as Ratifying Authority Congress Felt It Had</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling this past week that the federal government may tax interest paid on state and local government bonds was widely seen as ratifying authority <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> already felt it had. But the decision enraged one group of bond issuers who called it a `` butchery of the constitution'' and threatened `` drastic remedies if necessary'' to protect tax exemption from further erosion. Others worried the ruling may encourage a revenue-hungry <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to find ways to tax interest on such bonds to fill the gaping budget deficit. The ruling had no effect on the tax-exempt status of the estimated $ 730 billion in municipal bonds already outstanding nor on future issues, which are expected to amount to another $ 100 billion this year alone. Bond fund managers reported no significant selling in tax-exempt funds occurred after the ruling, and expressed confidence that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would never remove tax exemption retroactively anyway. But the ruling could have long-range implications for issuers who have been selling tax-exempt bonds at relatively low rates of interest for projects such as schools and roads as well as for investors who accept lower interest for their money because the payments have not been taxed by the federal government. `` We do n't take this as an inconsequential ruling,'' said <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Arndt </PERSON>, a spokesman for the National League of Cities. `` It is a very big threat to the capacity of state and local revenue systems.'' The case was brought by the state of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, challenging a law requiring that state and municipal bonds be registered in the name of the owner if the interest paid is to be exempt from federal taxation. It cited the 1895 case <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON> vs. Farmers' <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in which the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> held that interest earned on a state bond was exempt from federal taxation. This past Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rejected the challenge. In writing the majority opinion, Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said that owners of state bonds have no constitutional entitlement against having to pay federal taxes on the interest earned on the bonds. Justice <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, dissenting from the 7-1 decision, said the court overruled `` a precedent it has honored for nearly a hundred years'' and makes state and local government financing activities partly dependent on `` whether <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> voluntarily abstains from tapping this permissible source of income tax revenue.'' Word of the decision initially sent tax-exempt bond prices lower, but the market quickly bounced back as traders appeared to conclude that it made no fundamental changes in how <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> viewed the issue anyway. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has been legislating for some time under the presumption that the <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON> decision of 1895 was obsolete,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedlander </PERSON>, managing director for municipal bond research at <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. The chairman of the tax-writing <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ill </LOCATION>., said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has presumed for 20 years that it could enact laws involving the federal tax treatment of state and local government bonds He said there was no reason to believe that the court's latest decision `` will either prompt or deter future congressional action.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a trade group for bond dealers, said it was `` surprised and disappointed that the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> went out of its way'' to state its views on tax exemption. The group's president, <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON>, said laws enacted in the past few years have chipped away at the tax-exempt status of some municipal bonds. Fears that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would enact restrictions as part of the 1986 tax law prompted issuers to sell a record $ 220 billion in new long-term municipal bonds in 1985. New-issue volume has since fallen to $ 151 billion in 1986 and $ 105 billion in 1987 and is expected to fall to $ 100 billion this year, she said. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Beals </PERSON>, the executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cities </ORGANIZATION>, said local government officials have been `` angered and disgusted by the unrelenting assault'' by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the executive branch on local revenue systems and was `` even more outraged at the willingness of the judicial branch to condone and even encourage such activities.'' `` We do not accept this butchery of the constitution and we are prepared to respond with drastic remedies if necessary,'' he said. <PERSON> Arndt </PERSON> said that among the remedies are the possibility of amending the constitution, enacting legislation to spell out the exemption or making the issue fundamental to support or opposition for political candidates.

<HEAD>Durable Goods Orders Remain Strong</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Despite lower-than-expected orders to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories in March, analysts say the economy remains strong. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that orders for durable goods, items expected to last at least three years, were virtually unchanged last month, reflecting a drop in military hardware that offset gains in other areas. That was far less than the 1.3 percent advance most economists were expecting. However, the government raised its estimate of new orders in February. The revised report shows a 0.1 percent gain for the month, rather than the previously reported 1.1 percent drop. The net result was a relatively strong level of orders through the first quarter of this year, 7.9 percent above a year ago when compared March to March. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jasinowski </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION>, said the report indicated `` modest growth in the economy, not a boom but no signs of a big dip.'' <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinner </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, forecasting firm, said it was premature to worry about sluggish growth in new orders because shipments remain strong and the backlog in unfilled orders remains high. But the lower-than-expected results for March, along with a stronger dollar overseas, helped both the bond and stock markets, which have been depressed over fears of inflation and higher interest rates. The key 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond's price rose about $ 5 per $ 1,000 in face amount Friday and its yield fell back under 9 percent. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 27.69 points to 2,015.09.

<HEAD>Airline Smoking Ban Takes Effect</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: For Saturday PMs</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new federal ban on smoking on domestic airline flights lasting under two hours went into effect at 12:01 a.m. EDT today. The new regulations, which outlaw smoking on flights of less than two hours, carry stiff fines for violations: up to $ 1,000 for smoking and $ 2,000 for tinkering with lavatory smoke alarms. They apply to around 80 percent of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flights, or an estimated 13,600 a day. Under the new rules, airlines are required to announce to passengers onboard before takeoff that smoking is prohibited on the flight, and to keep the `` No Smoking'' indicator lights illuminated for the duration of affected flights. Even if a flight is delayed in the air or on the ground and goes beyond two hours, smoking will be prohibited if the schedule has it as lasting two hours or less, according to officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. In addition to the onboard warning, many airlines are making announcements in the gate area before passengers board the plane. Travelers flying <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest carrier, are being advised individually of the new regulations when they check in. Second-ranked <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airline </ORGANIZATION>'s flight attendants and ticket agents have been given special instructions to inform passengers about which flights will be non-smoking, and boarding passes have been changed. <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, whose tough policy goes beyond the federal requirements by banning smoking on nearly all its domestic flights, is handing out candies and mints as well as brochures to passengers. American is providing cinnamon hard candies suggested by the American <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lung </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> as a substitute for cigarettes. And <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> is distributing more than 430,000 pieces of a gum called `` Ban Smoke,'' designed to temporarily control the urge. Airlines say they have briefed their cabin crews on the new regulations and how to handle potentially defiant smokers. Flight attendants will tell the rebels that they are in violation of federal law and advise them of the consequences. If a passenger persists in smoking, airlines say they may notify authorities at the plane's next destination, arrange for the plane to be met by the police or even divert the aircraft in some cases involving unruly smokers.
