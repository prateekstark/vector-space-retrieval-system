 Officials of the World Alpine Ski Championships maintained Tuesday that no safety violations contributed to the death of a cousin of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s king, but a champion skiier suggested the victim was on a closed course. The Duke of <LOCATION> Cadiz </LOCATION>, a 52-year-old first cousin of King <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> and member of the international governing body of ski racing, was killed Monday at the <ORGANIZATION> Beaver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Creek </ORGANIZATION> ski resort when he ran into a cable being raised to hold a finish-line banner for the men's downhill course <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Borbon </PERSON> <PERSON> y </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Dampierre </PERSON> suffered neck lacerations and apparently died instantly, <LOCATION> Eagle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Coroner <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Meineke </PERSON> said. An official cause of death had not been released by Tuesday afternoon. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Borbon </PERSON> was at one-time married to the granddaughter of Spanish dictator <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Franco </PERSON>. Although he was not in the line of succession to the <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> throne, he was a descendant of <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> XIV </PERSON>, the French <PERSON> Sun </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, and was the Bourbon or `` legitimist'' candidate for king had the monarchy ever been restored in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. King <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> and Queen <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> expressed their sorrow over his death. `` There is no reason to believe that any safety violations occurred,'' <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Knous </PERSON>, president of the championships' organizing committee, told a news conference Tuesday. `` It truly appears that this was an accident, a very, very unfortunate and tragic incident,'' <PERSON> Knous </PERSON> said. Sheriff A.J. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> would not say Tuesday night whether <LOCATION> Eagle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> officials agree with <PERSON> Knous </PERSON>. `` We will make no conclusions about safety violations, not until the investigation is done,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. `` I will discuss the investigation with the district attorney. Until then, we are looking at all possibilities.'' But defending world downhill champion <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> said the victim and other ski officials ignored normal procedures when they skied down a closed course. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who said his investigation would take a month, confirmed that the course was closed, but said, `` We believe he -LRB- de <PERSON> Borbon </PERSON> -RRB- had the authority to be on there.'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Borbon </PERSON> was skiing Monday with companions when he hit the cable as course workers were moving the finish line and banners uphill from the end of the slalom course to the end of the downhill. Witnesses said one of the companions, former Austrian Olympic champion <PERSON> Toni </PERSON> <PERSON> Sailer </PERSON>, saw the cable and warned <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Borbon </PERSON>, who acknowledged the warning but still slammed into it at neck level, according to <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Knous </PERSON> said there were no safety violations despite the fact that the course was closed following an inspection by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ski </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, known by its French initials as <ORGANIZATION> FIS </ORGANIZATION>. Also there were no banners or identifying material on the cable that the duke hit. He said he could n't comment on whether the duke and his skiing companions should have been on the course at the time. <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON>, 31, one of the favorites in Saturday's race, said: `` Normally, when we prepare for a competition, the course is closed. But here, the <ORGANIZATION> FIS </ORGANIZATION> is skiing down for pleasure. I think that's a big mistake. If the downhill course is closed, it should be closed for all people.'' Downhill training went on as scheduled Tuesday although social events were canceled or postponed. Officials of the championships wore black armbands, and flags throughout the ski resort flew at half-staff. The Spanish ski team, which had been training at another <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> ski resort, still planned to come to <LOCATION> Vail </LOCATION> and compete, <PERSON> Knous </PERSON> said. The championship meet continues through this weekend. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Borbon </PERSON> served as <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> from 1969 to 1973, was president of the <ORGANIZATION> Spanish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Skiing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> from 1977 to 1984 and an eight-time Spanish skiing champion. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Borbon </PERSON>'s father was the elder brother of King <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON>' father Both men's fathers were the sons of King <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON> <PERSON> XIII </PERSON>, who abdicated the Spanish throne in 1931. The duke married <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> in 1972 and they divorced in 1982. In February 1984, the older of his two sons was killed in an auto accident in which de <PERSON> Borbon </PERSON> was driving. A judge ruled that <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Borbon </PERSON> had been negligent and stripped him of the custody of his other son. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez-Ochoa </PERSON>, the slalom gold medalist at the 1972 Olympics and a close friend of the duke, said <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Borbon </PERSON> liked to `` ski fast and drive fast.'' Referring to the duke's divorce, the fatal auto accident and the skiing tragedy, <PERSON> Fernandez-Ochoa </PERSON> described the victim as `` an unlucky person. Bad things happened to him.''

 After years of cold-shouldering the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> now sings its praises and increasingly suggests things for it to do. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollars to match the tasks are not forthcoming and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> remains the biggest <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> debtor. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is urging the world body to take on more responsibilities _ from monitoring the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> withdrawal from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> to fighting terrorism and drug trafficking and investigating human rights abuses and chemical warfare. It also is expected to monitor the eventual Vietnamese withdrawal from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and to play a role in a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> settlement. But little money is forthcoming from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to fund the burgeoning <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agenda for the 159-nation organization. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is the largest <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> contributor, assessed one-quarter of the annual budget of $ 800 million. While the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> has registered a series of formidable peacemaking and peacekeeping successes that advance <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interests, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has been withholding <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dues. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ended 1988 about $ 402 million in arrears in budget and peacekeeping dues _ 53.5 percent of the total <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> arrears of more than $ 750 million. Largely because of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nonpayment, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> periodically faces financial crises and is having trouble paying for new peackeeping operations. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador here, praised the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> during his election campaign and called for the payment of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dues. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has been withholding a large part of the dues because of budget constraints and disaffection with the world body. The organization was seen as biased against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, bureaucratically bloated and wasteful. Some money was withheld in an effort to force the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to reform itself, despite administration and <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> calls for full-funding. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said before leaving office as secretary of state said it is important for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign policy `` to fully fund our contributions to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agencies ... and to initiate a plan to pay arrearages ... over a five-year period.'' He said the request for nearly full payment of dues `` is critical to our objectives of resolving regional conflicts. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> can play an important role in this regard.'' <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Undersecretary of State <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON>, in charge of international organizations, said, `` Up through last year, the Executive, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> sought full funding. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> failed to appropriate the full amount.'' In a telephone interview, <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> said some people `` hold the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in disrepute when it does disreputable things.'' It rightfully is criticized, he said, for overspending and for political moves like a <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> resolution equating Zionism with racism. But he said the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> has improved because the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> took a firm stand. Last year, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> scored spectacular achievements and its peacekeeping forces won the Nobel Peace Prize. In <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observers are monitoring Soviet withdrawal under a U.N.-mediated agreement. For years, ending Soviet involvement in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> was a prime <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign policy goal. In the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeepers are monitoring a cease-fire while <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> are talking under <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> auspices. The cease-fire enabled the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to scale back its costly naval presence there. In southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> is helping to fulfill another <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goal: getting Soviet-backed Cuban troops out of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observers will monitor the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> pullout and peacekeepers will oversee <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s transition to independence from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> under a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> plan. In the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> conflict, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peace plan has been accepted by <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, anti-Moroccan guerrillas and <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> and the world body will supervise free elections there. In <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> has sponsored talks between <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> and Turkish Cypriot communities to discuss reunification of the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> island. In his final budget, President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> requested nearly full <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> funding in the 1990 fiscal year _ $ 205.5 million for the regular budget _ plus an additional $ 46 million to begin paying off <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arrears. The arrears of $ 403 million include $ 307.7 million for the budget and $ 94.1 million for peacekeeping. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has been paying its arrears and now owes $ 9 million to the regular budget and $ 172 million to peacekeeping. For almost eight years the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and the world body were estranged. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> charged it was ineffectual, pro-Soviet, anti-American and wasteful. But in his farewell address to the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in September, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> praised the world body for helping to end regional conflicts.

 The giant panda Ying-Ying, the female of the pair that made <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s panda breeding program the most successful outside <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, has died of unknown causes _ possibly a broken heart _ at age 14. <PERSON> Ying-Ying </PERSON>, who died late Sunday, had been depressed since October, about three months after Pe-Pe, her mate, died of cancer, said <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Elena </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON>, director of the Chapultepec Zoo. She said <PERSON> Ying-Ying </PERSON> had been ill for several days. `` We do n't what she died of,'' Ms. <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON> said. `` The autopsy did n't determine the cause'' but zoo officials hope laboratory tests will determine the cause. She said <PERSON> Ying-Ying </PERSON> had until Pe-Pe's death spent every day with the panda <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> sent as a gift in 1975, when <PERSON> Ying-Ying </PERSON> was 11 months old. `` She did n't want to live without Pe-Pe,'' Ms. <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON> said. `` She was very much in love with Pe-Pe. She did n't want to go out into the garden. She ate but not as well as she used to. `` She was n't as aggressive, as sure of herself. Before she would n't let you touch her and recently it did n't matter to her.'' Giant pandas are an endangered species and only about 18 are in captivity outside <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The animals generally have a life expectancy of about 20 years. <PERSON> Ying-Ying </PERSON>, who was nearly 15, gave birth to seven offspring after natural mating with Pe-Pe. Four survived. <PERSON> Ying-Ying </PERSON> accidentally rolled onto the first cub eight days after its birth in 1980, crushing it, and one each of two sets of twins died. <PERSON> Tohui </PERSON>, the oldest of the four surviving offspring, set off panda mania when she was born July 21, 1981, and is the zoo's hope for continuing to produce more pandas. In December, the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoo </ORGANIZATION> sent its 16-year-old male panda to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in hopes the two would mate. Ms. <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ying-Ying </PERSON>'s body, like Pe-Pe's, will be stuffed and put on display.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has called free choice `` the single most promising idea'' in education. But he'd get an argument from <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> and others involved in the nation's most comprehensive application of the concept. `` I do n't know if anyone can say it is off to a good start,'' said <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>, superintendent of a school district on northern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>'s Iron Range. `` We're very close to being out of business.'' The problem is that nearly a third of the district's 1,000 students have applied to attend school in neighboring <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, next year. The exodus is possible because of a statewide open enrollment program that will give all public school students freedom to choose where they attend school. <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>'s district stands in contrast to the affluent public schools in <LOCATION> Edina </LOCATION>, a predominantly white district in suburban <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. Two districts do not take outsiders: <LOCATION> Sartell </LOCATION>, because it is crowded; and <LOCATION> Edina </LOCATION>, because it voted not to take part in the open enrollment program. Critics say the open enrollment program wo n't reach the poor, penalizes small towns, invites inter-school athletic recruiting, leaves some districts with inappropriate staffing levels, and provides dissident parents an extortion tool to use on school boards. Others hail the program for promoting excellence. At a White House Workshop on Choice in Education on Jan. 10, former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> referred to open enrollment as `` that marvelous program in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> that is fostering unprecedented competition among public schools to make them more attractive to parents and students.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> are not the only admirers of the plan, which encourages free market-type competition among public schools. <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, enrollment options specialist with the <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said the program will probably `` weed out'' lackluster schools. Gov. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> said the program makes the state `` a national leader in empowering families to make choices about their children's education. But not all state officials are convinced. `` Based on the limited experience we've had in this state, it's ridiculous,'' said state Rep. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> McEachern </PERSON>, chairman of the state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Only 435 of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>'s 740,000 grade school and high school students applied for the program this year and applications for next year have reached 1,300. The program applies to school districts of more than 1,000 students, and will be extended to all school districts by the 1990-91 school year. Districts now have the option of voting not to participate. `` It's a choice for the rich,'' <PERSON> McEachern </PERSON> insisted. `` That's all. In Mountain Iron and <PERSON> Buhl </PERSON>, communities still recovering from the collapse of the taconite industry a decade ago, parents have been divided over which school buildings to close in the aftermath of a merger. Open enrollment has been an escape route from conflict, <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> said. The lower enrollment wo n't cut operating expenses, but it will reduce state aid by $ 1.2 million, a third of the district's budget, he said. `` If chaos continues, more students will leave and it will be lights out,'' <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> also said some poor families wo n't have access to open enrollment because of transportation costs. In <LOCATION> Edina </LOCATION>, where the 6,000-pupil district is 96 percent white and the average price of a home in 1985 was $ 141,000, the school board voted to opt out of the program. `` We kind of anticipated that this would be viewed as a racially motivated decision,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Edina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> Superintendent <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Smyth </PERSON>, who denied `` elitism'' played a role in the decision. He said open enrollment allows students to transfer schools for athletic purposes and other reasons he considers `` trivial.'' Another drawback is the inevitable erosion of education quality for students who remain in schools of declining enrollment, he said. But <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Edina </LOCATION> wants to `` pick and choose'' its students. `` The law says you ca n't deny a student because of their race or their academic ability or whether they're a problem student. You ca n't select and choose which kids are educated and <LOCATION> Edina </LOCATION> says ` We want to pick and choose,''' she said. The <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teacher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> has warmly endorsed open enrollment partly because `` parent and student satisfaction with their school is absolutely vital to their success,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Zohn </PERSON>, president. But <PERSON> Zohn </PERSON> noted that the <ORGANIZATION> PTA </ORGANIZATION> unsuccessfully lobbied for a declining enrollment fund that would have sent state money for one or two years to schools losing students to give them a chance to improve. <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> joked that the success of schools under open enrollment may someday be linked to their marketing ability. `` How about, ` Come here. We'll give all A's,' or ` Finish four years in three.'''

 Gov. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON> has gotten himself into an emotional battle by proposing to close the three charity hospitals that the nation's poorest state operates for its poorest people. <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON> says the poor would be better served if the money that funds the hospitals went instead into Medicaid and attracted federal funds, but opponents claim to have more than 100,000 petition signatures to keep the hospitals open. <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON>, who took office a year ago after a reform-based campaign, says the hospitals are underfunded and represent the lower tier of a double standard of health care in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. `` We have to work toward the day when where you live and how much you make are not the deciding factors in the standard of care you get,'' the 40-year-old Democrat said recently. But he has been unable to convince some people that the health care needs of the poor could be better served by closing <ORGANIZATION> Matty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hersee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Meridian </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Laurel </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Kuhn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Vicksburg </LOCATION>. The hospitals, set up in 1916, collectively maintain only 199 of the state's more than 15,800 hospital beds on a budget of $ 6.8 million. They served 77,508 patients in the 1988 fiscal year, out of a population of about 2.5 million. That includes 8,278 who required hospitalization and 69,230 outpatients. `` The buildings are older buildings, but they are well kept and they're very clean,'' said <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sprayberry </PERSON> of the state <ORGANIZATION> Eleemosynary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees charity hospitals. The governor's plan sparked a recent rally at the state Capitol. `` I do n't have no insurance, no Medicaid and you ca n't get no doctor to wait on you if you do n't have no money,'' said <PERSON> Georgia </PERSON> <PERSON> Mae </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, one of about 300 people who traveled the 90 miles from Laurel for the rally. `` When you go to the state hospital they take good care of you. They do n't ask you if you got money. They just wait on you,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. `` If you go to these other hospitals, they're going to turn you out. They're going to say you got to get some money and that's something these people ai n't got. <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON> hastily called a news conference to counter the public attention drawn to the rally. `` I think that the people marching today and I have the same aims and that's quality health care for Mississippians,'' <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON> said. `` I think as governor I've got to make the decision of how we can get the most health care for the most people.'' <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON> has said that putting into Medicaid the money that now goes for the charity hospitals would attract to the state an additional $ 28 million in federal matching dollars. He also has proposed other Medicaid expansions. <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> spent $ 440,258,967 on Medicaid in the 1988 fiscal year, which ended June 30, 1988. Of that, $ 346,324,369 was in federal matching funds and $ 93,934,598 in state funds. <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON> said his plan would provide medical assistance to far more people than are served by the charity hospitals. `` By shifting these funds to Medicaid, we can cover literally tens of thousands more Mississipians statewide. We can do it in a more equitable manner,'' he said. But opponents say they have more than 100,000 signatures on petitions and most legislators from the areas where the hospitals are located have worked against the governor's plan. `` My question is, if you close the charity hospitals, how many working poor people are going to fall through the cracks?'' asked state Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON>, whose district includes <PERSON> Matty </PERSON> <PERSON> Hersee </PERSON>. But lawmakers who back the goveror's proposal agree with him that the issue is one of quality health care for the poor. `` I think the people of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> can be served by the charity hospitals it they're properly funded, but they're not properly funded and the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> has refused to properly fund them for the last 10 years,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Buelow </PERSON>.

Tragedy put Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> into her role, portrayed by prosecutors as a brainwashed victim of brutality and by <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s defense as a fraud who killed the little girl they illegally adopted and raised until her death at age 6. The once-pretty woman bared her scarred face and psyche to television viewers during testimony that unraveled an all-too-common story of domestic violence. A state jury Monday convicted <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> of manslaughter. When Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, a 46-year-old former children's book editor for <ORGANIZATION> Random </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, was arrested with <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> after little <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s death, she had a black eye, broken nose, nine fractured ribs, split lip, cauliflower ear, and a leg so severely ulcerated that doctors called the injury life-threatening. Charges against her were dropped when prosecutors determined she was too physically and mentally incapacitated to be responsible for the girl's death. Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> agreed to become the key prosecution witness. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, 47, was charged with beating <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> on the night of Nov. 1, 1987. The death, three days later, of a child from an affluent, well-educated household, shocked many and became a nationwide symbol of family violence as a problem that cuts across social strata. Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>'s testimony described a 12-year relationship in which she was beaten, brainwashed and subjected to other bizarre punishments for transgressions imagined by <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>. Slowly, deliberately, Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> told how she came to see <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> as a `` godlike figure'' _ asking his permission to eat, obeying his orders to sleep on the floor or sit in a tub of cold water. Jurors saw handwritten pages in which Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> vowed to care about <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s hair, clothes, work, problems, diet, future, teeth and other concerns. In another paper, she wrote 10 times that `` anger is destructive'' and that `` self-defense is regressive.'' Her psychiatrist, <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Klagsbrun </PERSON>, has said Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> wo n't be ready to leave the Four Winds hospital in <LOCATION> Katonah </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, for at least two months But while she has n't made definite plans, <PERSON> Klagsbrun </PERSON> said he would n't be surprised to see Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> become an advocate for other battered women. `` She feels an obligation at this point to be helpful to others _ in helping people stand up and fight for themselves and regain a level of self-respect,'' said <PERSON> Klagsbrun </PERSON>. `` She's very conscious of the responsibility she now has to take a horrible part of her life and make it useful for other women as well as for herself, her own healing.'' `` She's articulate and intelligent. She has the capacity to relate and be available to other people'' _ and already has helped other patients during her hospitalization, said <PERSON> Klagsbrun </PERSON>. `` Her impact on other people who have experienced battering has been enormous,'' he said. `` She has allowed some people to reveal more than they were prepared to do ... to feel they can assert themselves in society and stand up to evil. People have said things along those lines to her.'' During seven days of testimony in December, Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> told her in bed, after they had free-based cocaine and while <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> lay comatose on their bathroom floor, that he had `` knocked <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> down and she did n't want to get up.'' The defense charged that Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> was jealous of <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s attention toward <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> and inflicted the fatal injuries Prosecutors said Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, who lost her job when she frequently missed work because of injuries, suffered from the battered spouse syndrome and was herself too much a victim herself to have hurt, or helped, the child.

 The waistcoat reputedly worn by <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> I </PERSON> at his beheading in 1649 is being taken back to the Museum of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> today, after a police crime lab failed to determine if its mysterious stains are royal blood. `` We have examined it but we can not tell if the stains are blood,'' said <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Divall </PERSON>, a biochemist at the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forensic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>. `` If we had a piece of the silk we could look for some form of hemoglobin by using intensive X-rays to show the protein structure, but naturally, the museum wo n't let us cut it up,'' said <PERSON> Divall </PERSON>. To discover whether the stains could have been the king's blood, the museum sent the waistcoat to the lab, where it underwent the routine tests that would be conducted in a modern-day crime, <PERSON> Divall </PERSON> said. `` I am convinced we have the king's waistcoat,'' <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Staniland </PERSON>, the museum's keeper of costume and textiles, said on Monday, the 340th anniversary of the execution. `` The workmanship of the knitting is right for the time and when it was bought for us from a collector in 1925, it had a note attached saying it had belonged to Dr. <PERSON> Hobbs </PERSON>, the physician who attended the king on the scaffold. It then passed to his daughter, <PERSON> Susannah </PERSON>, and remained with their descendants until it was auctioned in 1898,'' Miss <PERSON> Staniland </PERSON> said. The faded blue silk waistcoat is believed to have been worn by the king next to his skin when his head was chopped off on Jan. 30, 1649, after he lost his long struggle against the Puritan leader, <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Cromwell </PERSON>. The monarch stepped out on the scaffold in <ORGANIZATION> Whitehall </ORGANIZATION>, central <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, from a window of the <ORGANIZATION> Banqueting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, which still stands. The long-sleeved garment with buttoned neck opening and small upstanding collar has armpit stains, probably from sweat, but no collar stains. Two large stains, on the upper chest and abdomen, have survived an attempt to clean them off. `` We took ultraviolet light photographs and did a very sensitive chemical test for blood which we are doing every day on clothing, weapons and at the scene of a crime. We were not surprised at the negative results because blood would have degraded in 300 years,'' he said. The king was a small man, and the waistcoat's chest measures only 28 inches. It is long enough to reach his thighs. `` We wanted to see if the legend about the stains being blood could be true. But the only way we could prove that without destroying anything was if we had some proved bloodstains of the same period and we have n't,'' said <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Keene </PERSON>, the museum's head of conservation. `` An eyewitness of the execution said the king was wearing a sky blue garment, and the waistcoat is a faded sky blue,'' Ms. <PERSON> Keene </PERSON> added. Miss <PERSON> Staniland </PERSON> said: `` Authentication is a difficult business and it would help if we had other garments of the king.'' Knitted 17th century silk garments are believed to have been made in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. The waistcoat is displayed beside a sample of modern knitting in the same pattern as the waistcoat. Below it is a German engraving of the execution, supposedly drawn by a witness and showing the king kneeling. `` But the execution block was only 10 inches high so he must have been lying prone,'' Miss <PERSON> Staniland </PERSON> said.

 A jury Monday convicted <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> of manslaughter in the beating death of his illegally adopted 6-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>, a death that refocused national attention on domestic violence. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> showed no emotion as each of the 12 jurors was polled on the verdict, which came at 6:38 p.m, on the eighth day of deliberations in the three-month-old trial. He was acquitted on the more serious charge of second-degree murder. The verdict culminated a case that touched the nation's conscience, with witnesses providing wrenching detail of the physical and emotional havoc wrought by spousal and child abuse _ and the failure of others to intercede <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'s biological mother, <PERSON> Michele </PERSON> <PERSON> Launders </PERSON>, 27, said before the jury returned that `` the only verdict that would be justice for <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> is murder.'' After the verdict, she left the courtroom in tears and would not speak to reporters. She was sitting next to <PERSON> Graceann </PERSON> <PERSON> Smigiel </PERSON>, the grandmother of a young boy who was found in <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s apartment when police and <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> paramedics removed <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'s comatose body the morning of Nov. 2, 1987. The boy, who also was illegally adopted by <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, has since been returned to his biological mother. The conviction on the charge of first-degree manslaughter carries a maximum sentence of 8 1-3 to 25 years. It was a charge that prosecutors at one time had considered dropping from the case. Sentencing was set for March 8. In acquitting <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> of murder, the jury apparently concluded that <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> meant to hurt <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> but not to kill her; a second-degree manslaughter conviction would have meant he did not mean to hurt her but showed reckless disregard for her life. District Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgenthau </PERSON>, who promised to ask for the maximum punishment, said the trial `` highlighted the dreadful problems that beset our city _ child abuse, drug abuse and family violence. All of us have a responsibility to work to ensure that similar tragedies do not re-occur.'' <LOCATION> Ira </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s lawyer, said: `` We do not consider this -LRB- verdict -RRB- a win for <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> or a triumph for <PERSON> Joel </PERSON>.'' One of the jurors, <PERSON> Helena </PERSON> <PERSON> Barthell </PERSON>, 36, she argued in favor of convicting <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> of murder, said the jury had `` virtually ignored'' the testimony of <PERSON> Hedda </PERSON> <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s battered live-in companion of 12 years. Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheck </PERSON>, said she is `` relieved it's all over. He said she watched the verdict on television at the psychiatric facility in <LOCATION> Westchester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where she has lived since March 1988. `` The possibility of a hung jury was a very frightening prospect for her. She would have to go through this all again,'' he said. Public attention was riveted on the trial during Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>'s seven days of testimony last month Her story of abuse and psychological manipulation was broadcast live on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s three television network affiliates and in part nationally on the Cable News Network. Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, testifying under immunity from prosecution, said she was so dominated by <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> that she was unable to defend herself from virtually systematic beatings, or to protect the child, <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>. She also said she was unable to bring herself to summon medics promptly on Nov. 1, 1987, after <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> told her <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> was unconscious on the bathroom floor. The girl lay there nearly 12 hours by the time Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> called an ambulance; she died of brain damage in a hospital three days later. Defense lawyers claimed it was Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s live-in girlfriend, who fatally beat <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> out of jealousy over the attention <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> paid the child. Prosecutors _ pointing to Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>'s own severe injuries and deteriorated mental state _ said she was incapable of such an act `` She was a 45-year-old woman who appeared much older than her age,'' the emergency room doctor who examined Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> after her arrest testified at trial. `` She was chronically debilitated, malnourished, wasted.'' Nonetheless, state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothwax </PERSON> instructed the jury that it must consider Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> an accomplice in <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'s death. As such, her testimony had to be supported by other evidence. It was the layers of tragedy in the <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> case that commanded public attention. One question was how Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, a former children's book editor, could allow herself _ much less the child _ to sustain such damage. Another was how bruises on <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> could have been noticed by a student teacher at her elementary school and by neighbors, but failed to come to the attention of child welfare officials. Yet another issue was the ease with which <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> illegally gained custody of <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> and another child, 16-month old <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, from their unwed teen-age mothers. And at the center of the case were the unknown motivations of <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, a lawyer who was disbarred last fall for having falsely claimed a military exemption from the bar exam. He did not testify at the trial. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s lawyers denied that he ever beat <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>. Prosecutors and Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> told another story. Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> testified that on Nov. 1, 1987, he ordered her and the girl to eat hot peppers, then drink large amounts of water _ typical of the irrational behavior common in the household. Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> said that she was in the bathroom when <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> went into the bedroom to ask <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> if she could go out to dinner with him. About 6 or 6:30 p.m., he walked into the bathroom, holding <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'s limp body. `` And I said, ` What happened?''' Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> testified. `` He said, ` What's the difference what happened? This is your child. Has n't this gone far enough?''' They put the unconscious child on the bathroom floor. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> then left for dinner, saying `` Do n't worry, just let her sleep,'' she testified. When <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> returned from dinner about 10 p.m., she said they smoked cocaine. It was then that he admitted hitting the girl, she testified. About 6 a.m., <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> had stopped breathing and tried to revive her, she said. They finally called 911 at 6:30 a.m., she said. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s lack of concern for the girl exhibited `` more than depraved indifference to human life,'' Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Casolaro </PERSON> said at the trial. `` It was monumental indifference to human life.'' Staffers from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vincent </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, many of them clearly hostile to <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, testified that he appeared unconcerned about <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'s welfare and made distasteful comments when he was told she had brain damage. `` ` What you're saying is she's not going to be an Olympic swimmer,''' Dr. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilhenny </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> as replying. <PERSON> Casolaro </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> gave differing versions of details of the events of the night of Nov. 1, including how <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> was bruised. The defense said the prosecution's case, built largely on circumstantial evidence, did not disprove every possibility except <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s guilt, as the law requires. <LOCATION> Ira </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Adrian </PERSON> <PERSON> DiLuzio </PERSON>, <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s lawyers, sought at various times to explain <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'s injuries by suggesting she had choked on her dinner, had fallen, had been struck by a classmate, had contracted <PERSON> Reye </PERSON>'s syndrome and had been killed by doctors who put a monitoring needle into her brain.

 Romanian police `` manhandled'' <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s ambassador to that country as they prevented him from visiting a government critic who was under house arrest, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said.

The 46-year-old Argentine-born Israeli conductor and pianist was named Monday to succeed <PERSON> Solti </PERSON>, who is retiring at the end of next season after two decades as the orchestra's conductor. <PERSON> Barenboim </PERSON>, fired recently from the newly formed Opera-Bastille in a power struggle, will continue as director of the <ORGANIZATION> Paris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION>, a position he has held for 15 years, said <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON>.

The 76-year-old Hungarian-born <PERSON> Solti </PERSON>, who has won a record-high 26 <ORGANIZATION> Grammys </ORGANIZATION> and has been <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> music director since 1969, said he had the `` health and energy'' to continue here, but felt it was important to hand the baton over to someone younger. `` It is with the greatest pleasure that I welcome the appointment of <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Barenboim </PERSON> as my successor,'' said <PERSON> Solti </PERSON>, who also was <PERSON> Barenboim </PERSON>'s predecessor at the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Orchestra. `` I have known him and have been closely involved in his development as a conductor for many years and he is my first choice.'' <PERSON> Barenboim </PERSON> will be the ninth music director of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION>, which was founded in 1891. He will begin his tenure Sept. 1, 1991. `` The past 20 years of music making with the orchestra as a guest conductor have taught me to admire not only its unique qualities but also its members' devotion to music,'' <PERSON> Barenboim </PERSON> said from <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. Terms of the three-year contract call for <PERSON> Barenboim </PERSON> to conduct at least 12 weeks of concerts in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> each season. He also will lead all major tours for three to four weeks each year, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. The salary was not announced.

<HEAD>Urban Bus Company Sends Drivers To Charm School</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> ATHENS </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> _ In a bid to control hot Mediterranean tempers and teach them a smattering of English for the benefit of tourists, <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> bus drivers are being sent to charm school. The $ 4.3 million program is aimed at improving the image of the capital's public transportation system, which faces stiff competition from taxis whose cost is among the cheapest in the world. Classes such as `` Driver and Communication with the Public'' and `` English for Drivers'' are part of the 15-day courses for the staff of the semi-private <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>. `` The classes will help the driver control his Mediterranean temperament ... but passengers must also understand that it's not the driver's fault when the bus is late,'' said <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolas </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Union of Bus Drivers. Quarrels often break out between bus drivers and passengers irked by waiting for buses or when riders insist on getting off where there is no bus stop. Because of the chaotic state of public transportation _ bus routes and timetables are rarely available _ tourists often take taxis, which cost about $ 2 for a three-mile ride. The bus fare is 20 cents. <PERSON> Kolas </PERSON> said drivers' manners are n't helped by the aggravation of navigating the capital's notoriously congested streets. According to the transit company's chairman, <PERSON> Vassilis </PERSON> <PERSON> Xeomeritis </PERSON>, about 3,500 of the 5,000 bus drivers are very experienced but `` older people with almost no education. `` Our drivers could use some retraining ... they must understand that passengers are our customers and that it's the driver's duty to serve the public,'' <PERSON> Xenomeritis </PERSON> said. The corporation's 1,200 buses cover the whole of <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> _ a 120-square-mile area. With only one subway line crossing the city, more than 70 percent of Athenians commute by bus daily. A bus driver who would n't let his name be used said the public should also `` learn how to behave'' and use the transportation system properly. `` Passengers sometimes ask us unbelievable things,'' he said. `` We try to explain something to them and they are already so upset that they turn around and swear at us.'' About 1,500 drivers are scheduled for the course in 1989. The rest will take it in the next couple of years, said <PERSON> Christos </PERSON> <PERSON> Halazias </PERSON>, a transportation company spokesman. The corporation received almost half its financial backing for the training program from the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, he said.

 He is a man of conflicting images. A patriot, seven rows of ribbons on his uniform, charged with crimes against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Barring new delay, <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, 45, goes on trial Tuesday, facing a dozen cover-up and tax counts stemming from his role in the secret sale of arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the diversion of some of that money to the Nicaraguan rebels. The jury will decide, in the end, whether this former lieutenant colonel and junior staff member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> was true to his government and his mission, or whether his deceits, principally to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, were the designs of a rogue operating outside of law and <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> order. Along the way, the nation may learn more about the worst foreign policy debacle of <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s presidency. And about how <PERSON> North </PERSON> came to run some of the administration's riskiest ventures from a cluttered room, No. 392, in the Old Executive Office Building next door to the White House. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> tried for months to unravel those mysteries. But, like the 1987 commission headed by incoming <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>, congressional panels left many questions unanswered. Meanwhile, in nationally televised hearings, a defiant <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> emerged from his shadowy world, one of pseudonyms and codes and furtive border crossings, to confront his legislative tormentors. `` <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON> stood up there, took the heat, and the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people in every bar in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and every bowling alley in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and every little home said, ` Hey, this guy believes in something, and I can identify with it,''' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> last December. North's bravura performance, and his subsequent whirlwind of $ 25,000 speeches to cheering conservative groups around the country, revealed just one of his many sides. He has always been `` Ollie'' to his White House co-workers and the American right. But to his brothers and sisters, his high-school chums back in his hometown of <LOCATION> Philmont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, he remains <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>. To surviving members of his combat platoon in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, he is `` Blue,'' leader of `` Blue's Bastards.'' In other travels, he has been `` <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>,'' or `` Mr. <PERSON> Goode </PERSON>,'' or `` Mr. <PERSON> Johns </PERSON>,'' or `` <PERSON> Steelhammer </PERSON>.'' Another code name may be most telling: `` Blank Check.'' That was the term assigned to the private, inter-office computer communications network between <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and his superior, former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> Adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>. The Tower commission found that the creation of `` Blank Check'' coincided with the initial shipment of anti-tank missiles to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, 14 months before the scheme blew up in the administration's face in late 1986. According to <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first national security adviser, <PERSON> North </PERSON> was brought to the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> in 1981 `` to handle easels and carry the charts.'' Yet he became, in a matter of months, the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION>'s chief troubleshooter, responsible for Central American and terrorism issues, and played a vital role in some of the administration's most daring foreign exploits They included the invasion of <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> in 1983; initial arms shipments by the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> to the Nicaraguan rebels, also in 1983; the mining of three harbors in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in early 1984; a crackdown on the death squads in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and the organization of free elections there; the interception of an Egyptian airliner carrying the hijackers of the Italian cruise ship <PERSON> Achille </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON>, and the bombing raid upon <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> in 1986. Part of <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s ascendancy, no doubt, can be attributed to his own drive and fervor. `` If there was a loose ball,'' said retired Maj. Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Singlaub </PERSON>, a key player in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s efforts to aid the Contras, `` <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> would grab it and run with it.'' As a youth, he was kept on a tight leash. His father, <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> colonel who won a Silver Star in World War II, worked long hours at a family wool mill before it fell victim to polyester and he switched to teaching history. His mother, <PERSON> Ann </PERSON>, would whistle for the kids to come in every evening at 5 p.m. for dinner. Family ritual included a discussion of world events before the table was cleared. In school, he ran track and was in the chorus, chess, drama and science clubs as well as the student council. The girls voted him best-looking. North intended to follow his father, who died three years ago, into teaching, and enrolled at the state college at <LOCATION> Brockport </LOCATION> as an English major _ not pre-med at <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION> as he later claimed _ and joined the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserves </ORGANIZATION> as an officer trainee. After spending the summer at <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lejeune </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> he was a convert to the Corps. His appointment to the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> came after his sophomore year at <LOCATION> Brockport </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> North </PERSON> had to start over as a plebe. Then, before he'd really settled in, he was in a car wreck, suffering severe knee and back injuries. He boxed as a southpaw, and in the intramural ranks he made it into the finals against a highly favored <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, later to become a decorated combat veteran and a best-selling novelist. North won again, on points. After his graduation, a review board threatened to dismiss him because of his auto injuries. North made the board look at the film of his fight against <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>. He got his commission. Soon after <PERSON> North </PERSON> and <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> were married in a formal military service, he was shipped out, in December 1968, to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. He was `` all guns, guts and glory,'' according to <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrod </PERSON>, a fellow ex-Marine officer whom <PERSON> North </PERSON> credits with saving his life on the battlefield. Once, <PERSON> North </PERSON> was knocked off a tank rocked by enemy fire, and, despite broken ribs and a punctured lung, rose up to kill the enemy gunner with a grenade. That got him a Bronze Star. Other awards followed. But <PERSON> North </PERSON>, in recounting his <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> experiences, has sometimes seemed to exaggerate his record. He has testified that his decorations included `` several'' purple hearts; military records show two. He headed a platoon of 40 men, but said in court that he was a company commander `` in the Special Operations Force.'' Again, no record of it. He has said in court that he was in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> from 1968 through early 1970 `` and then again in 1971,'' but the corps says it has no record of an extended first tour or second tour. North did return to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, on his own time when word arrived that <PERSON> Herrod </PERSON> had been charged with war crimes in the killing of women and children. <PERSON> Herrod </PERSON> eventually was acquitted. While the case dragged, <PERSON> North </PERSON> was going off voluntarily to fight in the bush. After tours at <LOCATION> Quantico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, and on <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION>, he wound up with a desk at <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> headquarters. He worked 18 hours a day. Meanwhile, <PERSON> North </PERSON> and wife <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON> were going about the business of raising their four children. Something finally snapped. North wound up in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> for 22 days, diagnosed as suffering `` delayed battle stress.'' Once again, he overcame his medical difficulties, and was cleared for duty.

<HEAD>Commission Recommends Tax to Insure Those Without Coverage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Employers and all but the poorest <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> would be taxed to finance a national health care system extending medical insurance to the estimated 37 million who lack coverage, under a plan proposed by a commission including three former presidents. The proposal encourages continued reliance on private health insurance provided through the workplace, but calls for a new program to provide universal access to basic medical services. Costs would be spread among employers and all Americans above 150 percent of poverty level. The plan offered Monday is designed to extend medical coverage to all Americans, stem the growth of medical expenses which now stand at $ 550 billion annually, and improve the quality of medical care nationwide, said the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION>, which worked 2 -LCB- years preparing its proposal. `` If we continue the present trend, the $ 550 billion will double in six years and triple in 12 years,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> congressman from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> who co-chaired the commission with former <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, a Republican. The commission also is headed by three former presidents _ <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> _ who served as honorary co-chairmen. The commission was financed by 38 corporations, unions and foundations. The commission called its plan `` eminently fair,'' and estimated it would add about $ 15 billion to the $ 550 billion already being spent on health care annually. `` It is not something that will blow us over as a nation,'' said <PERSON> Uwe </PERSON> <PERSON> Reinhardt </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor of economics and member of the commission. Members of the commission are to meet soon with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials and members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to go over the recommendations. Under the proposed system, all Americans would be covered by a basic package of medical services, which would be the minimum coverage for all private health insurance plans and for a publicly funded benefits pool. Many workers would continue to get privately financed coverage as an employment benefit, with the employer paying most or all of the premium, and they could add to that coverage if they wanted. The federal Medicare insurance program for older and disabled Americans also would continue. Everyone else would be covered by the pool called the Universal Access program. Recipients of Medicaid, the federal health insurance program for the poor, would be covered by the new program. The Universal Access pool would be financed by all employers and by all individuals not covered by Medicare who have incomes above 150 percent of the poverty level. The schedule of fees would be designed to encourage employers to offer coverage to employees and improve coverage under some existing plans. `` There is strong incentive to keep the pool of people falling into the public system as small as it can be,'' <PERSON> Reinhardt </PERSON> said. Under the current system, the millions who are uninsured, though they can not pay for their health care, still do receive medical services, he noted. Their cost, however, is borne largely by hospitals and doctors that provide the care, and it inflates insurance premiums paid by companies for their workers, he said. `` There would be some shifting of costs from large firms who do offer generous health insurance packages to those who in some sense freeload and do not offer their employees any health insurance and thereby benefit. Their employees are implicitly covered anyhow and big business picks up the tab,'' <PERSON> Reinhardt </PERSON> said. Under the proposed system, employers who do n't provide a minimum level of health insurance coverage to their full-time workers would have to pay a fee for each worker not covered. In addition, all employers and employees would have to pay a fee based on employees' income The rates would be determined once a national package of basic services was developed. The commission also proposed a $ 500 million-a-year research program funded with the health care fees to study the effectiveness of current medical procedures. Such research could reduce inappropriate care and waste while saving at least $ 1.5 billion a year by 1993, the commission said.

 Former Miss America <PERSON> Vanessa </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said she was surprised by all the publicity the <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> movie `` The Sex Tapes'' received during filming.

 <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> farmer <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> Berntson </PERSON> stood before an audience at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> and spoke what he admitted sounded like heresy: Lock the plow in the barn, he advised, and farm without tilling. `` My neighbors say it is sacrilege, unpatriotic and everything else,'' he said. `` It was the plow that opened the prairie. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> made improvements to the plow. Why, the plow is mentioned in the Bible.'' Yet what <PERSON> Berntson </PERSON> advocated was n't heresy here. He was a participant in a <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> conference Monday on a new breeze in farming _ low-input agriculture. That's maximum farming with minimal disturbance to nature, farming with seed, soil and manure and as little chemistry as possible. The movement is similar in some respects to `` organic'' farming, although many low-input practitioners find they ca n't stay in business without using herbicides and other chemicals scorned by their more dogmatic counterparts. With drought blowing the topsoil away, the cost of petrochemicals skyrocketing and farmers coming under the scrutiny of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> for polluting groundwater, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> decided to take a fresh look at low-impact farming. Keynoter <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Erwin </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> farmer, said public impatience has given urgency to the cause. He summed up the public's attitude toward farmers this way: `` We paid you not to produce so much and you used chemicals and fertilizers to produce more, and spoiled the environment to boot.'' With his topsoil only six inches deep and more blowing away every time he plowed, <PERSON> Berntson </PERSON>, a third generation wheat farmer in northeastern <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, started no-tillage farming 10 years ago, raising wheat and barley from acres that normally get a mere 18 inches of rain a year. Does it pay off? The jury is out, he said. Farming his way is costly and still requires a lot of herbicides to control weeds, doing what his locked-up plow once did. He puts so much stuff on the weeds, he said, that `` we say we are plowing with a can and a jug.'' As for his neighbors, `` They are not quite ready to go to no-till, and maybe they're smarter than I am.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spends just $ 3.9 million of its $ 25 billion annual budget on `` alternative agriculture.'' <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a west-central <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> farmer, pleaded with it to do more. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who raises corn and soybeans with three sons on 3,300 acres, said he, too, has parked his plow, `` and if this makes me a good guy, I guess I qualify.'' He's a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, but he can hardly be called a low-input farmer, he said. To get corn yields of 150 to 200 bushels per acre, this is what he pours onto each acre: $ 24 in seeds, $ 51 in fertilizer, $ 18 in herbicides, $ 12 in insecticides and $ 50 to $ 60 worth of electricity to run the irrigation system. `` We know this is wrong,'' said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, `` but we do n't know what else to do about it because we still have to make a living. I belong to a lot of organizations that recognize the problem. But I have to make a living.''

Although <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> briefly continued his challenge, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> claimed he had enough votes to win and there was near-unanimous agreement within the party that he did. The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meets in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Feb. 10 to select a new chairman to replace <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>, who is giving up the job. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a former congessman from <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, said he spoke with <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> on Sunday and congratulated him for winning. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> was Democratic National Convention manager for presidential hopeful <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> last year.

He said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> `` has to take some steps that will show true independence'' and display a commitment to winning back Southern and Western voters to the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. He warned that the party is perceived by many as too liberal, that voting trends are moving against Democrats and that they could lose control of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and find themselves a true minority party in coming years. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> could go the way of the British <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> unless we make some fundamental changes in our message and image,'' he said. `` If the Democrats keep sweeping under the rug the fact that we are losing moderate voters, that we're losing adult white male voters, that we're losing white and ethnic minority young voters, if we keep sweeping those statistics under the rug and failing to face up to them, we are really buying our own doom,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said.

 No need to hold your nose. A new organization of skunk lovers says the animals make wonderful pets once their ability to create a stink is removed. `` These are the most misunderstood animals in the world,'' said <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Bone </PERSON>, a national authority on skunks. `` In the state of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, there has never been a documented case of rabies in domesticated skunks.'' So maybe rabies is n't what some people had in mind. But the new members of Skunks as <ORGANIZATION> Pets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> say they've taken steps to ensure that their pets are, uh, socially acceptable. Pet skunks are de-scented at an early age and are incapable of any olfactory assaultism, they say. About 30 people met Sunday to organize an Augusta-area chapter of the skunk organization. As they talked, their pets _ Stinky, <PERSON> Daisy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Barney </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pudgy </PERSON> and friends _ made themselves at home, ambling around and checking things out. Ms. Bone said pet skunks are not wild animals. In fact, Skunks As Pets, which is beginning to register skunks much like the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> does dogs, will not recognize a black and white skunk unless it can be proven the animal is domestic. Consequently, the skunks at the meeting were either albinos, which have been bred domestically for more than 100 years, or `` chocolates,'' which have been bred for 40 to 50 years. Ms. Bone was quick to point out that the animals are n't for everyone _ particularly children under age 12 _ and that they require conscientious care.

 Conservatives applauded and liberals took a wait-and-see attitude toward the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s recommendation of federal appeals court judge <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> as the new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> solicitor general. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sources confirmed Monday that <PERSON> Starr </PERSON>, 42, had been recommended to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to becme the government's chief appeals lawyer, arguing cases before the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and deciding whether to appeal lower court decisions against federal agencies. White House spokesmen said Monday they did not know when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> might nominate <PERSON> Starr </PERSON>, but a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: `` I understand it's a done deal. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has n't done anything on it, but we would n't have recommended it formally if we did n't think it suited his personnel people.'' The nomination would be subject to <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation. <PERSON> Starr </PERSON>, born in <LOCATION> Vernon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, has been on the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> since Oct. 11, 1983.

He had previously been mentioned as a possible <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> nominee after the 1987 retirement of Justice <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>. <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> was unavailable for interviews Monday, his secretary said. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Cribb </PERSON>, a top aide in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and in former Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday that <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> `` would make an excellent solicitor general.'' `` I found him to be quite compatible with the conservative judicial philosophy of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration in all matters,'' said <PERSON> Cribb </PERSON>, a senior fellow at the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Fein </PERSON>, a conservative columnist and attorney who was associate deputy attorney general during President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first term, said in a November 1988 column that <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> `` epitomizes the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> judicial legacy.'' <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION> said Monday that virtually all of <PERSON> Starr </PERSON>'s written opinions `` have been earmarked by conservative instinct, yet open-mindedness. There's no ideological fervor.'' But liberals expressed some wariness. `` We're looking at the nomination very cautiously,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Liss </PERSON>, legal director for People for the American Way. `` I think the most interesting thing about <PERSON> Starr </PERSON>'s selection is that it gives the administration another seat in the <LOCATION> D.C </LOCATION>. Circuit to fill,'' she said. `` <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> has been a less reliable conservative than the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration may have hoped when it selected <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> to sit on the court.'' One seat on the appeals court, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>'s, already is open. <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> resigned after the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rejected <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s nomination to place him in the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. To <PERSON> Colleen </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, `` <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> is a question mark.'' However, she added, `` All the signals that have come out of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> do not seem all that different from what we've seen in the past.'' In some recent cases, <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> has joined with other judges to uphold First Amendment rights. In other cases, he helped overturn court-imposed limits on the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>'s prison population and helped throw out the <ORGANIZATION> D.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s affirmative action hiring plan. <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> received his bachelor's degree from <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in 1968, got a master's from <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in 1969 and graduated from <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in 1973.

 Thirty-two medical employees of the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> have been disciplined for accepting money and other gratuities from drug companies doing business with the agency. The <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> said Monday that its department of medicine and surgery took the action as a result of a three-year investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> inspector general into dealings between <LOCATION> VA </LOCATION> doctors and other employees and five pharmaceutical suppliers. The actions were for the acceptance of travel expenses, speaking fees, grants or consulting fees, and for being absent from work without taking vacation to do the outside work, the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> said. The probe began after an earlier investigation into dealings by another drug company resulted in disciplinary actions against 34 <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> physicians and other employees in 1987. In response to a Freedom of Information Act request, the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION>'s office of inspector general said that in the latest actions one employee was suspended, 29 received admonishments and two received reprimands, which are more serious than admonishments In three other cases no action was taken because the employees resigned. Six cases were referred to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which decided against prosecution in four of them, in most cases citing lack of criminal intent. The other two cases remain under consideration. In addition, the agency provided counseling to 18 employees and issued instructional letters to 473 employees _ steps that were the result of the investigation but are not considered disciplinary actions. The inspector general withheld names of the employees involved. In a written statement, the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> said the employees violated regulations or policies concerning actual or apparent conflict of interest through the improper acceptance of money or other gratuities. Many of the cases involved <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> doctors or other employees attending or speaking at meetings and symposiums sponsored by the companies. Assistant Inspector General <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kroll </PERSON> said the investigation has not been closed and that actions involving several <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> employees have not been completed. Investigative reports released by the inspector general said that in one case, a VA doctor employed part-time received fees and expenses totaling over $ 175,000 from <ORGANIZATION> Eli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lilly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and for two years had a $ 10,000 a year consulting agreement with <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON>. During that period he served as chairman of a VA hospital's formulary committee, a panel that selects drugs for use by the hospital In another case, a <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> employee received speeking fees amounting to $ 35,050 and expenses of $ 14,018, and was absent from work for 335 hours, the agency said. In still another, an employee received honoraria from two companies on 79 occasions, including fees of $ 38,250 and expenses of $ 34,018. In addition to <ORGANIZATION> Lilly </ORGANIZATION>, companies involved were <ORGANIZATION> Ciba-Geigy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Hoechst-Roussel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceuticals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Merk-Sharp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Dome, and <ORGANIZATION> Abbott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION>. The original investigation involved payments by <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION>. Both investigations involved activities in 1981 through November 1985. <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION>'s department of medicine and surgery, said that following the initial investigation the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> took steps to ensure employees were familiar with regulations and policies prohibiting certain dealings with private companies. The VA, which in March will become the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, operates the nation's largest hospital system and has 194,000 employees.

 The dogwoods may not be blooming at Camp David this spring because of a devastating fungus disease that the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says could become a national epidemic among the native trees. <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> plant geneticist <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Santamour </PERSON> said Monday that the disease has swept through native dogwood seedlings at a test site near the presidential retreat in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Catoctin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>. The seedlings were from 17 states and proved highly susceptible to anthracnose disease. `` They all declined in vigor, and after two years 75 percent were dead,'' <PERSON> Santamour </PERSON> said. He predicted that all of the test seedlings will be dead by the end of 1989. <PERSON> Santamour </PERSON>, who works for the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> at the National Arboretum in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said no North American flowering dogwood trees of the species Cornus <LOCATION> florida </LOCATION> are known to resist the disease. Asiatic or Chinese dogwood, Cornus kousa, which produces flowers similar to <LOCATION> C. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> florida </LOCATION>, showed some leaf spotting from the disease but otherwise were said to have performed well in <PERSON> Santamour </PERSON>'s study. The fungus that causes dogwood anthracnose has not been identified exactly, he said. But there appears to be no insect carrier of the fungus, as with Dutch elm disease. The dogwood fungus depends on wind and water to spread from tree to tree. <PERSON> Santamour </PERSON> said the origin of the disease outbreak is obscure. It began in the late 1970s on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> among C. nuttallii dogwoods and the <LOCATION> C. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> florida </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, he said. `` However, we can probably rule out environmental stress as a casual factor,'' <PERSON> Santamour </PERSON> said. A 1984 survey of nearly 50,000 dogwoods in <LOCATION> Catoctin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> confirmed scattered reports of the new devastating disease among the native dogwoods. <PERSON> Santamour </PERSON> there is probably little hope for finding native dogwoods resistant to anthracnose. Dogwoods in the study were grown from seeds from <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>.

 It's long past time for scoffing at so-called low-input farming and its reduced use of fertilizers, pesticides and weedkillers, say a growing number of experts, including senior <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials and many others. <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Erwin </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> farmer and a member of the federal <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday that so-called low-input, sustainable agriculture _ called <ORGANIZATION> LISA </ORGANIZATION> by advocates _ does not mean returning to the era of horse power and manual labor on the farm. `` We can not look back, we can not look at it as going back,'' <PERSON> Erwin </PERSON> told the conference. But there are some good reasons _ economic and environmental _ for farmers to trim back on some of the the items they use, such as fertilizer and pesticides. And the manner in which those items are used. `` There is a growing force in our society that says to farmers that we paid you not to produce while you used chemicals and fertilizer to produce more and more _ and we want lower cost programs and a safer environment,'' he said. The concept of low-input, sustainable agriculture has been around for a long time. It has grown since the energy crunch of the 1970s, and as environmental issues such as soil and water pollution have taken a deeper hold. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in the 1985 farm law authorized <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> to conduct research and education programs in `` alternative farming systems,'' often referred to as low-input or sustainable agriculture. In 1987, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> appropriated $ 3.9 million to push the LISA concept. The two-day conference at the department attracted about 150 registrants to hear farmers and other talk about their experiences with low-input production methods. More than 100 of those registered represented special interest groups, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> agencies and other federal offices. <PERSON> Vivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, deputy administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> Extension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, called <ORGANIZATION> LISA </ORGANIZATION> `` an issue whose time has come'' but cautioned that no one should expect miracles. `` We should recognize it's not a panacea,'' <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> said. `` It's not going to solve all of our problems, and we need to remember that as we move ahead. <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> Berntson </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> farmer who uses the low-input approach for years on his 2,000-acre operation, said that federal farm programs helped put production agriculture into a rut. `` I do n't need to remind you that the government farm programs of the past have not rewarded the best management practices,'' he said.

 Severely depressed patients not only see the light but turn from SAD to glad while wearing an unusual hat fitted with two fluorescent tubes, according to researchers who hope to help millions with the device. The invention is a hat that looks like a pith helmet with the two tubes placed parallel to the eyebrows. It was designed as a portable, wearable way to treat patients suffering from a severe form of winter depression dubbed seasonal affective disorder, or SAD. `` Almost everyone I know ca n't stand February and looks forward to spring,'' said Dr. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Brainard </PERSON>, a neurologist who along with biomedical engineer <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> developed the hat at <ORGANIZATION> Thomas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jefferson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. But, he said, the victims of SAD have an `` outright lack of energy and an inability to cope.'' SAD is characterized by withdrawal, social isolation, depression, a craving for carbohydrates, weight gain, a tendency to sleep longer and fatigue. People with SAD generally improve as springtime's sunnier days grow closer Scientists estimate that SAD severely afflicts about 10 million Americans. About 25 million experience a milder form of the disorder. Most of the cases occur in the northern states, where days are shorter. Researchers have found that exposure to bright light, or phototherapy, alters the production of the hormone melatonin and relieves the depression. <PERSON> Brainard </PERSON> said researchers believe the therapy works because light directed into the eyes stimulates a region of the brain called the hypothalamus, which controls production of hormones, including melatonin. How light works to alter hormone production and relieve depression is not known, he said. The two, 6-inch lights _ five times as bright as the light in a well-lit room _ fit under the brim of the hat, which is attached by a cord to a battery pack worn on a shoulder strap. <PERSON> Brainard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> designed the first prototype two years ago. This month, they began testing the hat on six patients with SAD and hope to treat up to 20 this season. `` In 85 percent of SAD cases, light therapy has caused a significant improvement or complete relief of all symptoms,'' said <PERSON> Brainard </PERSON>. But most patients ca n't spend their days outside in bright sunshine. The light hat enables people to fit the phototherapy into their busy lives by wearing the hat at home. Patients wear the hat for about two hours a day, usually in the morning, said Dr. <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, director of <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>'s SAD clinic. `` A portable device makes it possible for a person to receive therapy and still maintain a regular morning routine,'' she said. Patients using conventional phototherapy must spend one to five hours daily in front of a fluorescent light box. The bulky light box weighs about 25 pounds and patients often complain about scheduling the therapy around jobs and family. `` You ca n't really carry them on an airplane,'' <PERSON> Brainard </PERSON> said. Five of the six patients using the hat have responded to the treatment, Ms. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said. `` One responded so well that even after she was withdrawn -LRB- after a week of wearing the hat -RRB-, she has n't relapsed into depression in three weeks,'' she said. The patient who did n't respond was physically ill at the time and will test the hat again. Other scientists also are working on similar projects. Dr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wehr </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rockville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, said he and his collegues designed several prototypes of a `` light visor'' two years ago and found it extremely effective in treating SAD. `` We had trouble getting the devices back,'' he said. <PERSON> Wehr </PERSON> said he was aware of at least one or two other groups working on similar devices and his group is continuing development of a lighter version. Both groups have applied for patents. The knowledge gained through the clinical testing of the light hat will further <PERSON> Brainard </PERSON>'s research for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> on artificially lit environments, such as the space shuttle. <PERSON> Brainard </PERSON> said that as humans and animals spend increasingly longer time in space, researchers are concerned about how the body can react adversely to artificial light. His research is financed in part by the space agency to design and develop lighting systems for the shuttle and the planned space station.

<HEAD>Suit Filed to Block Use of Animal Genes in Human Treatment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge is being asked to block the first application of genetic engineering using an animal virus gene in the experimental treatment of human cancer. The request is contained in a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> lawsuit filed Monday by the <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trends </ORGANIZATION> and its president, <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON>. It asks for an injunction to block plans by researchers at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> to use a rat virus to manipulate a gene in an experimental treatment of melanoma, a virulent and often fatal skin cancer. The suit claims that the institute's <ORGANIZATION> Recombinant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> DNA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which reviews human genetic engineering experiments, approved the cancer therapy without conducting proper public hearings. As the suit was being filed in downtown <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Monday, <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON> and others in the foundation met with the 25-member committee at the institute's offices in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> for a heated discussion of <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON>'s proposal that the <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> be required to form a citizen's committee to evaluate dangers involved in human genetic engineering Members of the institute's advisory group voted 23-0, with two members abstaining, against forming the citizens committee. <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON> vowed to `` come back again and again and again'' with his proposal. The lawsuit asks the court to block the first formal attempt ever to insert a foreign gene into human beings. The suit targets research approved earlier this month to treat melanoma patients with a type of white blood cell, called a tumor infiltrating lymphocyte -LRB- TIL -RRB-, that has been genetically altered. TIL cells are developed by the body in small numbers to fight the growth of melanoma tumors. Three <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> researchers, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>, <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Blaese </PERSON> and W. French <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, showed in earlier work that TIL cells can be used to battle cancer by taking them from a patient's tumor, growing them in large numbers in the laboratory, and then reinserting them into the patient. In results published in December, the technique was at least partially successful in 12 of 20 patients. To understand why TIL therapy works for some, but not others, the scientists want to trace the white blood cells after they are returned to the patient. In order to do this, the researchers want to mark the cells with a bacterial gene that produces a resistance to neomycin, an antibiotic. In this way, cells from the patient's tumors or blood stream could be identified and movement of the cells into the tumors could be monitored But in order to get the gene of the bacteria into the white blood cells, the scientists proposed to use a rat leukemia retrovirus. It was the use of this virus that triggered the lawsuit. The study proposed that the experimental therapy be used on 10 melanoma patients with a life expectancy of just 90 days, and that it not be used on other patients until the technique is re-evaluated. The research proposal underwent seven months of reviews, including hearings by <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> committees, the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and a congressional committee. On Jan. 18, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyngaarden </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION>, gave final approval. In their lawsuit, <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON> and the Foundation on Economic Trends say the approval was not proper because a subcommittee review of the proposal was not conducted with public notice and public participation, and that final approval by the full committee was by a mailed ballot, instead of in a public hearing. A court clerk said the case has been assigned to the court of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON>. No hearing had been scheduled Monday, but the clerk said it would probably be sometime this week.

<HEAD>Bush's 1984 Report Took Middle Road on S&amp;Ls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is n't talking yet about his plan to restructure the savings and loan system, but the report of a study group he headed as vice president may preview his approach. If the 1984 recommendations of the <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> are any indication, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will take a cautious approach rather than advocate a wholesale restructuring of the industry. The 1984 report recommended maintaining a separate system for S & amp; Ls, at least in the near term, but allowing S & amp; Ls to become banks as their activities and services grew more bank-like. And, rather than calling for a return to old restrictions, the group emphasized a system of incentives _ including risk-based insurance premiums and higher capital levels _ to encourage <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls to operate safely. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s staff director for the task group, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON>, joined the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> staff last week and is expected to play the key role in shaping the administration's <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L plan. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Monday that the president hopes to outline the plan in a Feb. 9 speech, although he may not have all the details by then. Much has changed since <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signed the task group report. But, although the magnitude of S & amp; L insolvencies had not yet come to light, the study recognized what since has been identified as a key contributor to the problem: permissive laws in some states that allowed <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls to stray into risky areas far removed from their traditional business of making home mortgage loans. Rather than force S & amp; Ls to revert to their traditional form, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> group recommended risk-related insurance premiums, requiring institutions entering new areas to pay more into the government insurance fund than conservatively run S & amp; Ls. Currently all S & amp; Ls pay the same premium. Higher levels of capital also would discourage excessive risks, it said. The owner of an S & amp; L with low capital levels has little to lose and much to gain from taking a big risk, while the taxpayers who are the ultimate backers of insured deposits have much to lose and nothing to gain. The task force recommended that S & amp; L capital levels be brought up to the stricter standards applied to commercial banks. That is now being done, but wo n't be in full force until 1991. Contrary to the current thinking of most analysts, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s group advocated that federal regulators turn over some of their authority to the states _ but only to states whose regulatory systems met federal requirements. That would create an incentive for states to develop stronger regulatory programs, it argued. As a guard against states whose standards slip, it said federal insurers should be permitted to revoke the insurance of state-regulated institutions. Currently, there are two schools of thought regarding the future of the S & amp; L industry. One, advocated by the chief industry lobby group, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION>, contends that thrifts should remain distinct from commercial banks, but that they ought to stick primarily to mortgage lending. The other school says there's no longer a need for a separate industry. It notes that commercial banks and mortgage firms owned by non-financial companies such as <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> have entered home mortgages in a big way thanks to government-chartered agencies which buy mortgages and repackage them into securities for sale to investors. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> task force steered a middle course. It recommended retaining the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> for thrifts and keeping three separate insurance funds: for banks, thrifts and credit unions. But it offered a mechanism for the financial system to evolve. Thrifts that stuck primarily to mortgage lending would remain part of a separate system. At a certain point, <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls that entered enough new areas, becoming more like banks, would have to join the bank regulatory system with its stricter regulation.

<HEAD>Loophole in Election Law Moves Toward Closing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD L. VERNACI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are moving to close a custom-made loophole in federal election laws allowing some of them to keep unspent campaign funds, a potential personal bonus of up to $ 1 million each. The loophole, which was written to help ensure passage of the 1980 election law, has since lost some of its popularity in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Repealing the provision is now part of a package of legislation related to a pending 50 percent pay raise. `` It's an embarrassment to them,'' <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Ornstein </PERSON>, a political analyst with the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday. `` It's the sort of question not too many members who were there before 1980 want to have asked of them `` I think it's a foregone conclusion that they'll do away with it.'' More than $ 61 million in surplus campaign funds is sitting in the accounts of 191 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members and 71 senators who were in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> when the law was passed. A `` grandfather clause'' in the law allows them to convert the money for personal use, an action forbidden for those who came to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> later. On the average, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members who were grandfathered in hold about $ 224,000 in their campaign accounts, while senators, whose campaigns usually are considerably more costly, have an average of $ 341,000, according to <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> records. `` I did n't go out and spend all the money because that's not the way I operate my own home,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>, R-Ky. `` I spend what I think is appropriate to win. <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>, who cruised to re-election on a 3-to-1 margin last year, had $ 604,824 left over in his campaign account, according to records at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. That puts him in 10th place among members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. The top spot in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> belongs to Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, with more than $ 1.1 million. <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON> is co-sponsor of a bill that would abolish the grandfather clause. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ill </LOCATION>., has more than $ 1 million _ up from $ 596,000 since January 1987 _ and has not expressed an opinion on the issue of abolishing the loophole, according to an aide In the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, the list is topped by <PERSON> Sens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, with nearly $ 2.1 million and <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, with $ 1.9 million. However, those amounts are not unusually big war chests since both those senators face re-election campaigns next year. The legislation now before each house would eliminate the possibility of letting the grandfathered members convert leftover funds to their own uses but would continue permitting conversion for the other uses allowed under the law. Candidates for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> can use leftover campaign money to support political organizations or other candidates. In addition, members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> can use the money to `` defray any ordinary and necessary expenses'' arising because of their position. And, unlike the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has a rule forbidding its members from converting their campaign money for personal use, although it does not have the force of law and its effect on former senators or their survivors is unclear. Proposals to abolish the exemption in both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> have come up as members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are about to pick up 50 percent pay raises, boosting salaries from $ 89,500 to $ 135,000 annually for rank-and-file lawmakers. <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> said Monday that he kept his campaign treasury stocked with cash because he represents a largely <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> district and he does n't want to borrow. `` You will never see <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> holding one of these dumb fish frys at $ 25 a head to retire a campaign debt,'' he said. He offered to give back money over the next month to `` anybody who donated to my campaign last time and is not satisfied. Please contact me, and I will send the money back.''

<HEAD>Drug Testing Program Blocked</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A federal judge has blocked a random drug-testing program at the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, calling it an example of `` bureaucracy run amok'' that would deprive thousands of people of their fundamental right to privacy. The program, which would have taken effect today, would require 17,000 of the agency's 70,000 employees to be tested for drug use. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> granted a preliminary injunction sought by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION>. In his 36-page opinion, <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> said the program is `` essentially a show ... in which the civil servants employed at the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> are the involuntary players.'' The program was aimed at those who were considered to be holding jobs sensitive enough to require drug testing. The department's definition of sensitive positions included clerical assistants, mail and file clerks, auditors, cartographers and printing press operators <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> said such designation of routine job holders `` as being all in sensitive positions is bureaucracy run amok.'' <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> said the government's goals `` do not justify a significant intrusion into an employee's privacy, particularly when there is absolutely no showing that drug use exists that is impairing the routine functions, let alone the critical responsibilities, of the department.'' <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> said the program would deprive thousands of citizens of fundamental privacy rights, `` not because anyone actually suspects that they are drug users, but because they are employees of the government whom that government believes it can command on that account to repair to the toilets, so that it is able thereby to demonstrate its commitment to the war on drugs.'' The program had been envisioned by former <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> as a model for the government. <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> did not enjoin the department from testing employees on `` reasonable suspicion'' of drug use. And, the lawsuit did not address the department's recent policy requiring drug tests of job applicants, including secretary-designate <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who was the first tested under that policy.

 <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Rainey </PERSON>, the sheriff when three civil rights workers were slain in rural <LOCATION> Neshoba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in 1964, is demanding a retraction from the producers of `` Mississippi Burning.'' `` They did n't use my name but nobody in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> or any other state has any doubt they intended that sheriff to be me,'' said <PERSON> Rainey </PERSON>, 65, now employed as a security officer in <LOCATION> Meridian </LOCATION>. `` We will be mailing a demand letter for a retraction on Tuesday and that's a prerequisite for a lawsuit under <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> law,'' said his attorney, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McIntyre </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rainey </PERSON> was acquitted on charges of violating the civil rights of the three workers in a federal trial at which he was represented by <PERSON> McIntyre </PERSON>. <PERSON> McIntyre </PERSON> said the film `` mixes fact with fiction and depicts <PERSON> Rainey </PERSON> as terrorizing citizens of <LOCATION> Neshoba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. It depicts him as being a person bent on violence and it is not an accurate, fair account of what did happen in <LOCATION> Neshoba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in 1964.'' On June 21, 1964, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaney </PERSON>, 21, who was black, and whites <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, 20 and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwerner </PERSON>, 24, disappeared after they were released from the county jail in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. They had been stopped for speeding after investigating a church burning by the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION>. Their bodies were found 44 days later in a soggy earthen dam in rural <LOCATION> Neshoba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. All three had been shot to death. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>'s `` Mississippi Burning,'' an <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> release, is loosely based on the murders. The film, which stars <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Hackman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Willem </PERSON> <PERSON> Dafoe </PERSON>, has drawn both praise from movie critics and criticism from blacks who contend it gives the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> too much credit in the civil rights struggle. <PERSON> Rainey </PERSON> maintains his innocence and said the movie had subjected him to ridicule. `` The character in the movie was a big man like me and he chewed tobacco like I chewed tobacco all the time,'' said <PERSON> Rainey </PERSON>, who works for a black-owned security firm. `` Everybody knows it was made off the happenings in <LOCATION> Neshoba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>,'' he said Monday. `` The actor had twice as big a crew of tobacco as I ever had but they might have well as called him <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Rainey </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Rainey </PERSON>, who served as <LOCATION> Neshoba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff from 1964 to 1968, said he had lost a security job in 1975 following a movie based on the civil rights violence in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. `` I've got a good relationship with blacks,'' he said. `` I'm working for a black man and a black company but he is getting a lot of feedback for working me. The former sheriff said he wanted <PERSON> McIntyre </PERSON> to proceed with a damage suit immediately because `` of the way it has hurt me and is going to hurt me.'' `` If they say ` We are sorry for what has happened and it is n't true,''' <PERSON> McIntyre </PERSON> said, `` that still does not negate a cause of action, it only mitigates the damages. <PERSON> McIntyre </PERSON> noted that of the 18 individuals brought to trial on charges of conspiring to violate the victim's civil rights, only <PERSON> Rainey </PERSON> and a few others were found innocent. Seven were convicted and given sentences ranging from three to 10 years. Calls to <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> were not answered late Monday afternoon.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is reaching out to congressional Democrats on the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L crisis after creating a furor over a plan to charge depositors a fee for federal insurance of their savings and checking accounts. Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, who floated the idea of a depositors' fee last week in meetings with congressional Republicans, met privately Monday with <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, and other key Democrats to stress other options being considered. Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, D-Ill., chairman of the tax-writing <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, quoted <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> as saying during the meeting in <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s office that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has made no decisions on any of the alternatives `` Everybody's looking for the path of least resistance,'' <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> said. `` There's no solution that's not going to be painful.'' Industry and government experts say the cost of closing insolvent thrift institutions while protecting their depositors against losses would range from $ 90 billion to more than $ 110 billion over the next 10 years. The alternatives include issuing $ 25 billion to $ 60 billion in bonds, some of it backed directly by the government or through raising the premiums that banks and savings and loan associations now pay for federal insurance. `` The healthy institutions wo n't be for increased premiums,'' <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> said. But he added that the idea of charging depositors about $ 2.50 for each $ 1,000 in their checking or savings accounts in federally insured institutions `` is as flat as a pancake.'' White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Monday that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> hopes to spell out plans for dealing with the savings and loan crisis in his Feb. 9 budget address to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> but might not be ready with details by then. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and other administration officials will continue to seek advice from members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> despite complaints by White House Chief of Staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> that lawmakers had leaked discussions of a fee on deposits. `` Consultations are a very important part of the process,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been reaching out to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in many forms. We would expect that to continue.'' <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> had suggested on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Week with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>'' on Sunday that certain members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> may have violated the administration's trust in leaking word that the depositor fee was being considered. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said such a fee _ which some critics say would violate <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s no-new-taxes pledge _ remains an option.

 Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told religious broadcasters that `` the gospel'' of <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> still pervades the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must be realistic in dealing with that communist nation. Speaking Monday to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Religious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> had over the years gained an `` appalling confidence in its own wisdom, indeed, its own omniscience.'' `` I think the root of the matter all comes back to a hatred of God, to a rejection of the entire concept of a religious system,'' he said. Comparing the American revolution with the communist revolution in <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, `` Look how much good has come into the world as a result of the first revolution and how much evil has entered the world because of the second.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is addressing the group Wednesday. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s comments, somewhat reminiscent of <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s rhetoric in the early days of his presidency when he called the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> an `` evil empire,'' differed in tone from recent <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> remarks concerning the Soviets <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has used less harsh wording, but has urged a cautious approach to U.S.-Soviet relations, which were improving as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s term came to an end White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s comments were not inconsistent with administration policy <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>, the leader of the 1917 Communist Revolution, as saying the idea of God is `` unutterable vileness ... of the most dangerous kind.'' `` That was <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> and unfortunately his gospel is still actively pursued in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. On the other hand, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> founding fathers had a `` belief in the existence of a Creator whose laws have placed irrevocable limits on the power of the state.'' He also said that if <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s planned 1991 international human rights conference occurs, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must ensure that it `` is not just a public relations extravaganza for the Soviet leadership.'' President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he would follow through on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s plan for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> participation in the conference, but also has said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials will be watching Soviet human rights performance in the interim. Talking about his trip this week to <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, `` My message will be democracy, democracy and more democracy,'' he said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is not expected to make any policy initiatives during the trip but plans to meet with a number of heads of state who will attend Thursday's inauguration of <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s new president, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>.

<HEAD>New Regulations Aim at Protecting Patients' Rights, Improving Care</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's 15,000 nursing homes will have to meet higher standards of care and give patients more say in their treatment, under new regulations for Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement. The final regulations, announced Monday, cap several years of efforts by the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to meet the terms of a law passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 to improve the quality of nursing home care. `` These regulations change our focus in regulating nursing homes, away from looking to see merely if a facility has the capacity to deliver care, to looking at the quality of care that is actually being delivered,'' said Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roper </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> HCFA </ORGANIZATION> administrator. Among other things, the regulations will: _ Give patients the right to refuse treatment, manage their own money, receive visitors, manage their own privacy, express grievances, be free of physical restraints and not be transferred or discharged against their will _ Offer patients services needed to treat specific conditions and guard against such things as inappropriate weight gain and loss and bed sores _ Require nursing homes to have 24-hour nursing capability, including a registered nurse for eight hours of every day _ Require facilities to train nurses' aides, provide dental, vision and hearing care, and offer an activities program by a qualified professional The final regulations will apply to nearly 15,000 long-term care facilities. The rules are open to a 90-day comment period and most will go into effect 90 days after that. The rest will go into effect Oct. 1, 1990. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents licensed nursing homes and long-term health care facilities, generally endorsed the regulations, but expressed concern about the length of time it is taking to put them in place. The group also is concerned that `` if there is not adequate funding for them, they wo n't have the impact they were intended to have,'' said <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Keegan </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the association. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nursing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said it was `` extremely concerned at the disregard for the quality of care'' in the regulations. <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON> <PERSON> Joel </PERSON>, president of the nursing association, criticized the rules for permitting <ORGANIZATION> HFCA </ORGANIZATION> to waive a requirement that a registered nurse be on duty for eight hours a day, seven days a week. The <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> agency has proposed no criteria on which to grant waivers `` and has implied that the waivers may be used as a way to cut the budget for <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> and Medicaid nursing home programs,'' she said. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyer </PERSON>, director of provider service coverage policy at HFCA, said the law allows waivers only when a nursing home ca n't find nurses to hire and would be granted only if quality of care were not affected. The agency will be issuing proposed rules for waiver requirements in the next couple of months, he said.

<TEXT>
 A new drug therapy can extend the lives of men with advanced prostate cancer by nearly 25 percent, according to a study on which the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> based its approval of the new treatment. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> on Monday approved the new hormone-blocking drug flutamide for use in combination with another drug that affects hormone production in patients whose prostate cancers are in the most advanced stage. The drug will be marketed under the trade name Eulexin by the <ORGANIZATION> Schering-Plough </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> cautioned that `` flutamide is not a cure,'' but he said a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> study `` demonstrated how it can be used to extend the lives of some men.'' Young also stressed that when detected in the early stages, prostate cancer can be treated successfully. `` These prostate cancers generally need not get to this stage _ if every man over 40 would have a simple rectal exam each year,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. Cancer of the prostate, a walnut-size gland at the base of the male bladder, is the third leading cause of cancer deaths among American men. It kills more than 25,000 men annually and about 100,000 new cases are reported each year, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said. The disease often develops with no noticeable symptoms. Warning signs can include difficulty in urinating, frequent urination and presence of blood or pus in the urine or semen. These are the same symptoms that mark prostate infections and a benign enlargement of the prostate that is common in older men. In its early stages, the disease can be treated successfully by removing all or part of the prostate or by radiation. But if the cancer spreads to other tissue and organs, chances of successful treatment diminish considerably. The <ORGANIZATION> NCI </ORGANIZATION> study involving 617 men with advanced prostate cancer showed that flutamide, in combination with the previously approved drug leuprolide, extended survival by nearly 25 percent. Patients receiving the two drugs survived an average 34.9 months, seven months longer than the group that received leuprolide alone, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said. The drug has been in clinical development for 15 years and is marketed in 34 countries, <ORGANIZATION> Schering-Plough </ORGANIZATION> said. The drug works by blocking the spread of cancer cells in the prostate as well as in surrounding tissue. Scientists believe the male hormone testosterone stimulates proliferation of cancer cells by a diseased prostate. Leuprolide stops production of the hormone by the testes, and flutamide is believed to inhibit the hormone's action on cancer cells by blocking the receptor sites that testosterone uses in the cells, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said. Side effects of the combined therapy included hot flashes in 61 percent of the patients, loss of libido in 36 percent, impotence in 33 percent, diarrhea in 14 percent and nausea and vomiting in 12 percent, the agency said.

<NOTE>Study Says Electric Power Shortages Possible in 1990s</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> power companies must build more generating capacity than currently planned or the nation may face an electricity shortage in the 1990s, a trade group says. Based on conservative projections of growth in electricity demand, the nation will need an additional 50,000 megawatts of generating capacity by 1997 in order to avoid a shortage, a newly published <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> study said Monday. That amount would be needed in addition to the 32,500 megawatts of capacity currently under construction, the study said. Using an assumption of faster electricity demand growth over the next decade, which the gas group said it considered to be more realistic, an additional 105,000 megawatts of plant capacity would be needed to avoid shortages. The study said 71 percent of capacity additions planned in the 1979-88 period were canceled.

The plan would hold handgun manufacturers, importers and dealers liable for damage caused by handguns, in the same manner that some states hold tavern owners or party hosts liable for injuries caused by drunken drivers. The bill is supported by 12 of the 13 council members in a city whose officials are worried about a rising murder rate. January is already the bloodiest month in city history, with 49 killings through Monday. The highest yearly total was set in 1988 when 372 people were killed in the nation's capital.

<HEAD>FCC Proposes Lottery for Awarding Radio, TV Station Licenses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> is trying to abandon the method it has used for the past quarter century to grant radio and television licenses in favor of a random lottery. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> decision Monday to scrap the old comparative licensing process was immediately criticized by a media watchdog group, which said the commission was abdicating its decision-making responsibility and closing what has been a means of access by minorities and women to broadcast ownership. In voting 3-0 to dump the old process, commissioners called it slow, costly and not guaranteed to determine the best applicant. Under the old system, would-be owners must prove their worthiness to hold a broadcast license. <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> said the lottery is `` faster ... arguably more equitable.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> said the lottery process would be less costly to applicants, and therefore, `` would lower entry barriers and encourage newcomers to enter the broadcast industry.'' But <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartzman </PERSON>, executive director of the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Access </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION> advocacy group, said the lottery proposal was `` an outrageous, last-ditch effort to substitute a roll of the dice for government officials defining and implementing the public interest.'' `` It's spitting in the face of minorities and women and experienced broadcasters and instead it's going to bring in the buccaneers on the night flight from <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Schwartzman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Schwartzman </PERSON> claimed that when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1982 gave the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> the power to use the lottery process, it did not envision it being used for full service broadcasters. The commission previously has instituted lottery procedures to award licenses for low-power TV stations and cellular telephone operations. The comparative process conducts hearings to compare applicants on factors ranging from the extent to which applicants would diversify media ownership, the degree to which media owners would be integrated into station management, whether such owners were local residents or minorities and the degree of differences in the area in populations to be served. Administrative law judges then grant preferences to applicants on each comparative factor. The applicant with the best comparative record receives the license, pending appeals _ a process the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> said may take anywhere from three years to five years. Commissioner <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> said the lottery would preserve two major items of the comparative hearings: credit for diversification of ownership and minority ownership. `` I think that what we've set up in this item will insure that minority applicants and those with no other broadcast interests will do at least as well under a lottery as they would have done under a comparative hearing,'' she said. She said that under the current system, one applicant in most cases will buy out a competing applicant during the challenge process, and the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> merely approves the settlement. `` I'm told that 80 percent of all our cases settle, and in those cases we then play absolutely no role in enforcing our comparative criteria,'' <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> said. `` So the applicant with the worst comparative qualifications can simply buy out the other applicants and we will routinely approve the settlement.'' She said she was concerned about how the public benefits `` by having applicants pay each other $ 65,000 to $ 70,000 even before they begin to build a station.'' The proposal will be open for public comments following its official publication in about two weeks, the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> said.

<HEAD>Surrogate Mother, Couple Who Split Up Wage Three-Way Battle For Custody</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A woman who gave up her baby girl under a surrogacy agreement and the couple who intended to adopt the infant but then got divorced are waging a three-way court battle over custody of the child. The fight, further complicated by the fact that the sperm donor is not the man seeking custody, centers on blond-haired, brown-eyed <PERSON> Tessa </PERSON>, now 4 years old, biological daughter of <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Stotsky </PERSON>. In January 1985, the day-old girl was given to <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Reams </PERSON> and <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON>, a married couple who paid Mrs. <PERSON> Stotsky </PERSON> $ 10,000 and expenses under a surrogate mother agreement. The marriage broke up a year later, before the couple started adoption proceedings. The legal entanglements began a short while later in juvenile court in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> when Mrs. <PERSON> Stotsky </PERSON>, Reams and Ms. <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> petitioned for custody. Subsequently, Reams filed an adoption petition with Mrs. <PERSON> Stotsky </PERSON>'s consent, prompting Ms. <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> to file one of her own. Legal and personal complications have delayed a decision in the case and put the child and her future at risk, according to Mrs. <PERSON> Stotsky </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Grimm </PERSON>. `` I honestly feel for all three of these people. They all love her,'' she said. `` My client is pursuing this for the benefit of <PERSON> Tessa </PERSON>. She wants to make sure she gets a good home.'' Despite their clients' differences, Ms. <PERSON> Grimm </PERSON>; <PERSON> Tessa </PERSON>'s court-appointed attorney, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Milless </PERSON>; and Reams' attorney, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Halliburton </PERSON>, agree on one thing: <PERSON> Tessa </PERSON> is bound to get hurt `` It really is a legal ping-pong game,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Halliburton </PERSON>. `` Unfortunately, <PERSON> Tessa </PERSON> is the ball.'' <PERSON> Milless </PERSON> said his goal is to protect <PERSON> Tessa </PERSON> from pain. `` Any child involved in a custody battle is an unfortunate child. Overall, she's in pretty good shape. We have protected her, or tried to, from publicity,'' he said. `` I'm not so sure that she understands all of this.'' A court-ordered paternity test revealed that a sperm donor other than Reams was <PERSON> Tessa </PERSON>'s biological father, despite what Ms. <PERSON> Grimm </PERSON> said was a `` gentleman's agreement'' among the three parties that Reams would be the father. Although the donor, a former colleague of Mrs. <PERSON> Stotsky </PERSON>'s, has waived any claim to the child, both would-be adoptive parents and Mrs. <PERSON> Stotsky </PERSON> have not. All three filed custody petitions in juvenile court, but a complicating factor is that <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> has no law governing surrogacy contracts. The custody requests were put on hold while the question of petitions for adoption, filed by Reams and Ms. <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON>, was debated. Reams and Ms. <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> temporarily lost their separate efforts to adopt <PERSON> Tessa </PERSON> last week when Probate Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metcalf </PERSON> dismissed their adoption petitions primarily on the grounds that the two had failed to post required $ 3,000 bonds. The order moves the case back to juvenile court, where custody and financial support will be determined, <PERSON> Milless </PERSON> said. Reams likely will appeal <PERSON> Metcalf </PERSON>'s decision, Ms. <PERSON> Halliburton </PERSON> said. `` If his rulings are not reversed, a choice will have to be made,'' she said. `` This child, who loves both of her parents and who truly believes that they are her parents, will be awarded to one of them.'' Ms. <PERSON> Grimm </PERSON> said another married couple is interested in adopting <PERSON> Tessa </PERSON>, but has yet to formally enter the case. All three attorneys indicated they would fight any attempt by an outside party to adopt the girl. Ms. <PERSON> Grimm </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Stotsky </PERSON> is undecided about whether to continue her pursuit of custody once the case goes back to juvenile court. Ms. <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> could not be reached for comment on the case because she has an unlisted telephone number. <PERSON> Tessa </PERSON>, now a ward of the juvenile court, splits her time each week between Reams and Ms. <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON>, who live in separate towns near <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>. Although <PERSON> Tessa </PERSON> knows Mrs. <PERSON> Stotsky </PERSON>, she is unaware that she is her biological mother, said Ms. <PERSON> Grimm </PERSON>. <PERSON> Milless </PERSON> said he has no plans to appeal <PERSON> Metcalf </PERSON>'s ruling because he believes adoption may not be right for <PERSON> Tessa </PERSON>. `` I see no reason that one person should be allowed to adopt as opposed to the other. Adoption freezes the others out of the life of the child,'' he said.

 Prices for raw materials all over the world reached their highest level for the 1980s last year, according to figures collected by the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. It calculated that the drought in this country pushed the average price of wheat to $ 168.90 a metric ton, or $ 4.69 a bushel, last month, compared with an average of $ 112.10 a metric ton, or $ 3.11 a bushel, in 1987. Big demand by the industrial countries of east <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> helped raise the price of copper to a record $ 3,498.90 a metric ton, nearly $ 1.20 a pound, the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. The average rise for a long list of commodities was 10.2 percent for the year. That brought the overall level to just a little _ 2.8 percent _ above the average for the years 1979 to 1981. Problems of Third World countries have been aggravated in recent years by low prices they have been getting for the products of fields and mines, their chief source of foreign income. For some, things are now improving. Aluminum, nickel, rice, sugar, bananas, fats and oils were all up for the year. Timber, cotton and oranges were down. In addition to the Arab countries of the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, oil is a major export for <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> and others. <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> benefits doubly: from the rise in the copper price and the drop in the oil price, because oil is a big import. The average oil price in 1988 was $ 13.60 a barrel compared with $ 17.20 a barrel in 1987, and the price dropped as low as $ 11.60 a barrel in the fourth quarter of 1988. However, oil prices increased steadily in December, reflecting growing market confidence in the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION>' November decision to set a production ceiling of 18.5 million barrels a day, according to the report. <PERSON> Penelope </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartland-Thunberg </PERSON>, trade expert at the independent <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, said that commodity prices go in short-term cycles, now up and now down. But the long term trend is now toward a decline as new inventions come into use and fewer raw materials are used for each dollar of goods produced. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION>, pointed out that there is sometimes a wide spread even within individual commodities. High quality arabica coffees from the highlands of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> are being bought more and more in western <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, he said. The report credited the reintroduction of export quotas under the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agreement </ORGANIZATION> as helping raise the price of arabicas by 20 percent in 1988. That meant a shift away from the lower grade robusta coffees grown nearer the sea in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>. Their prices were down by 8 percent. <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> also emphasized the uneven effects of price movements. `` The newly industrialized countries in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> are importing feed for pigs and poultry,'' he said. `` That pushes up the price of grain up for the low income countries of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, which have to buy more because they're producing less themselves and there's less foreign aid available.'' <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> countries, especially the <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, are suffering from low prices for both their coffee and cocoa.

<TEXT>
 The lead witness in the `` Night Stalker'' trial described finding the nearly decapitated body of his mother, whose slaying was the first of 13 blamed on the man who terrorized <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> four years ago. `` There was a neck gash as if someone tried to remove her head and almost succeeded,'' <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Vincow </PERSON> said of his 79-year-old mother, <PERSON> Jennie </PERSON>. `` The sight of my mother's head almost removed was just too much to deal with.'' The trial of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> was scheduled to resume today with more testimony from <LOCATION> Vincow </LOCATION>, who discovered his mother's body in her apartment on June 28, 1984. During his opening statement Monday, Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Halpin </PERSON> gave a detailed account of each of the slayings, using an enlarged <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> map as a guide. The prosecutor called for the death penalty against <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, a shaggy-haired drifter from <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, who was chased down by a mob and arrested in the summer of 1985. <PERSON> Halpin </PERSON> did not emphasize the satanic or ritualistic aspects of the serial murders. He let sensational aspects of the crimes speak for themselves and delivered a low-key outline of the crimes that will be recounted for the <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury during the trial. `` This is where your work begins,'' he told the panel. Defense attorney <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> reserved his opening remarks until after the prosecution concludes its case, which <PERSON> Halpin </PERSON> said would take four months. <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, 28, is charged with 13 slayings and 30 other felonies stemming from the crime spree. The unpredictable defendant, who once shouted `` Hail, Satan!'' in court, was subdued in the packed courtroom Monday and sat slumped in his chair. Dressed in a dark gray suit and sunglasses, he was shackled at the ankles as a security measure. The shackles were kept from sight of the jury. <PERSON> Halpin </PERSON> described how the `` Night Stalker'' killed his victims through a combination of shooting, slashing and bludgeoning. Most of the female victims were raped, sodomized and often asked to `` swear to Satan.'' Although the prosecutor said satanic symbols were found at some murder scenes, he hinted the real motive was burglary. He said the killer told his victims virtually the same thing: `` Where's the money? Do n't look at me. Shut up.'' <PERSON> Halpin </PERSON> said the prosecution will prove its case through fingerprints lifted from crime scenes, ballistics tests and eyewitness testimony. `` Makes you scared to go home at night,'' muttered spectator <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Vgoretz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> as she left the courtroom. `` I heard so much about him. ... I had to see him in person,'' she said, adding, `` I'm fascinated.'' <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> was arrested after he was captured by an angry <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> mob on Aug. 31, 1985, the day his picture appeared in newspapers for the first time identifying him as the alleged `` Night Stalker.''

<HEAD>Dollar Closes Lower Against Yen, Stock Shares Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar closed lower against the Japanese yen Tuesday while share prices on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> reversed morning declines to close slightly higher. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which had lost 64.05 points at the end of the morning session, closed 13.80 points, or 0.04 percent, higher at 31,581.30. The index lost 111.57 points Monday. The dollar ended trading at 129.13 yen, down 0.60 yen from Monday's close of 129.73 yen. The currency opened at 129.59 yen and moved between 129.05 yen and 129.63 yen. The dollar's lower opening in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> followed a decline in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Monday when traders who had bought dollars Friday sold for profit taking, dealers said. The dollar closed at 129.30 yen in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Monday, down from last Friday's finish of 129.43 yen. `` In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, market players were not making any major moves except for some position adjustments, and many of them remained on the sidelines trying to determine the future of the dollar-yen rate,'' said <PERSON> Minori </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeuchi </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. However, she said, the currency's slight loss Tuesday morning did not signal a reversal in the trend toward a stronger dollar. Trading was also thin because of the lack of market-affecting news, Ms. <PERSON> Takeuchi </PERSON> said. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> index, the market's main barometer, opened lower despite gains in the Dow Jones industrial average in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Traders said institutional investors were cautious due to fluctuations in the dollar-yen rate on foreign exchange markets. Trading was directionless in the absence of major market-affecting incentives, said one trader with a major securities firm in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity.

<TEXT>
 An <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> businessman and a Dutch national have been arrested for diverting shipments of an industrial lubricant to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> for use as a chemical weapon by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, authorities said. Besides announcing the arrests, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities said Monday that a Baltimore-based company agreed to plead guilty to one count of violating export laws in connection with the export of thiodiglycol. The lubricant, used in inks and textiles and sold under the brand name <PERSON> Kromfax </PERSON>, produces lethal mustard gas when combined with hydrochloric acid. <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Defino </PERSON>, 64, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and Dutch citizen <PERSON> Frans </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Amraat </PERSON>, who was apprehended in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, on Jan. 26, were charged with conspiracy, listing phony destinations on export documents and violating <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> export laws. <PERSON> Defino </PERSON> surrendered to <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> on Monday and was released on bond after appearing before a magistrate. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Amraat </PERSON> is awaiting extradition. The chemicals, manufactured by <ORGANIZATION> Alcolac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, were illegally shipped to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> by separate agents during 1987 and 1988, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Breckinridge </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Willcox </PERSON>. The two men were accused of shipping the chemical to <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> then to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. From there, the chemical was transported to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Willcox </PERSON>. Four shipments, each weighing more than 100 tons, were sent to <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in 1987 and 1988, but at least three wound up in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, according to the federal complaint. Last year, a West German pleaded guilty to purchasing a component of mustard gas from <ORGANIZATION> Alcolac </ORGANIZATION> and shipping it via <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> DeFino </PERSON> conducted business with <ORGANIZATION> Alcolac </ORGANIZATION> through <ORGANIZATION> Nu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, purchasing the more than 400 tons of the chemical, authorities said. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Amraat </PERSON> was the European agent for Nu <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON>, authorities said. <PERSON> Willcox </PERSON> said <PERSON> Defino </PERSON> is vice president of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Alcolac </ORGANIZATION> officials said the chemicals were sent to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> without their knowledge. `` That was not my understanding,'' said <PERSON> Willcox </PERSON>, who refused to elaborate. <ORGANIZATION> Alcolac </ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said the company was unaware the chemicals were going to the destinations other than the European points listed on shipping documents. He said the company has cooperated fully with federal investigators. One former employee filled out the shipping documents in a way that ran afoul of the complex provisions of the Export Administration Act, <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said. The employee did not know the eventual destinations, he said. <PERSON> Willcox </PERSON> declined to say whether the worker would be charged. `` No one within this company had any indication that these materials were going to be diverted to the Iran-Iraq war zone,'' <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said. `` We feel just awful that one of our products was misused for that end use.'' The federal investigation previously led to the arrest in July of <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Walaschek </PERSON>, a West German employee of <ORGANIZATION> Chemco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G.m.b.h. </ORGANIZATION>, who purchased three shipments of the chemical during 1987 and 1988 for shipment to <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and then re-exported them to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Willcox </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Walaschek </PERSON> pleaded guilty to violating American export law for arranging the shipments. After initially agreeing to cooperate with prosecutors as an informant, <PERSON> Walaschek </PERSON> fled the country, forfeiting a $ 350,000 bond, authorities said. <PERSON> Willcox </PERSON> said talks were continuing with West German officials about extraditing <PERSON> Walaschek </PERSON>. Chemco had purchased thiodiglycol at the direction of Sexed Kharim <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Sobhani </PERSON>, an Iranian diplomat stationed in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday. Under American law, exporting the chemical requires a license. Shipments to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> are barred. Chemco purchased three shipments of thiodiglycol from <ORGANIZATION> Alcolac </ORGANIZATION> and 90 tons were delivered to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in 1987 and 1988, <PERSON> Willcox </PERSON> said. A later shipment of 120 tons was intercepted by Customs investigators, who substituted water for the chemical and then traced their travels to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, authorities said. One ton of thiodiglycol produces about a ton of mustard gas. One hundred tons would cover about 50 square miles.

 Pakistani officials are willing for the first time to agree to verification that they are not building nuclear weapons if they are permitted to buy U.S.-made reactors for power production, says a senior member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, who brought the proposal back from a recent trip to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, said Monday it deserves serious consideration and he will hold hearings on the idea in his <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> subcommittee. <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON> said `` key'' Pakistani officials had endorsed the reactors-for-safeguards swap but declined to say which ones. During his stay in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> he met with new Prime Minister <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Ghulam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> and army Chief of Staff Gen. <PERSON> Aslam </PERSON> <PERSON> Beg </PERSON>, among others. Under the proposal, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> would agree to some form of negotiated verification process to ensure that its nuclear program is put only to peaceful uses, and is not devoted to weapons development. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s nuclear intentions have been a source of friction in past relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, although <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy-makers sought to put those concerns aside in recent years because of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s cooperation in funneling weapons to the anti-Soviet rebels in neighboring <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Now that Soviet troops are being withdrawn, however, the nuclear issue has come back to the forefront of relations between the two countries. Administration officials have said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> may be cut off after Sept. 30 because President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will not be unable to certify that the Pakistanis have not developed a nuclear weapon. Further details of the <LOCATION> Pakistani </LOCATION> weapons program were reported Monday by <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, which said nuclear materials made in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> found their way to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> through by way of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The network said heavy water from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> weapons reactor complex near <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, was sold to a West German company and was processed 15 to 20 years later into the tritium gas used to build nuclear warheads. Then, after being sold and resold, it reached another <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> firm, <ORGANIZATION> NTG </ORGANIZATION>, which shipped the gas to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is receiving $ 230 million in military aid and $ 215 million in economic aid from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this year, making it the third largest beneficiary of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid after <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON> said an agreement that would provide safeguards against Pakistani weapons development could not only head off a prickly showdown over <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid, but it also could facilitate a budding reconciliation between <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and neighboring <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. `` If the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is willing to sell nuclear reactors for peaceful nuclear energy, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> would agree to establish full-scope safeguards on all their nuclear facilities, including existing ones,'' <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON> said in describing the proposal made by <LOCATION> Pakistani </LOCATION> officials. `` If we can cap the Pakistani nuclear program at its present level, that would represent a very significant and constructive development.'' <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> in the past has refused to cooperate in international inspection procedures under a non-proliferation treaty. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> said recently that her country will not sign the international treaty unless <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> does too. <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON> noted that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s relatively high level of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid was based on its key role in supporting the Afghan rebels, and that the withdrawal of Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> would lessen the need for military aid. But he said there might be a greater need for economic aid than in the past. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, in its 1991 budget proposal, asked that military aid levels to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> be increased to $ 240 million and economic aid be increased to $ 250 million.

<HEAD>Track Athletes Kill Six, Wound One In Fujian</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two track-and-field athletes using starter pistols killed six people and wounded another for unknown reasons before police killed one of them in a shootout, a newspaper reported today. The official <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sports </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> said 300 armed police officers surrounded a building in the sports center in the southern city of <LOCATION> Fuzhou </LOCATION> on Monday and exchanged shots with <PERSON> Shang </PERSON> <PERSON> Weidong </PERSON>, a 110-meter hurdler, and <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhichuan </PERSON>, who specializes in the decathlon. <PERSON> Shang </PERSON> died in the shootout and <PERSON> Li </PERSON> was wounded, the newspaper said. The incident began Sunday morning when <PERSON> Shang </PERSON> and <PERSON> Li </PERSON> met three acquaintances and asked them for $ 540. The report said it was not clear why the two men asked for the money, but their request was refused. An official at the <LOCATION> Fuzhou </LOCATION> city police department said `` women were involved in the incident'' but declined to elaborate. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has recently seen a rise in prostitution, especially in the richer cities along the country's coast. The pair went to the room of their three acquaintances later that afternoon, crashed through the door and began firing, killing the three acquaintances, the paper said. The pair then locked themselves in the room. A short while later, two men and two women entered. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shang </PERSON> killed three of them and seriously wounded the woman, the paper said. They then fled to the provincial sports center, where several close friends, also track-and-field athletes, helped them hide. Early Monday morning, police found <PERSON> Li </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shang </PERSON> hiding in the attic of the five-story building. After a stand-off of almost three hours, police killed <PERSON> Shang </PERSON> and captured <PERSON> Li </PERSON> in a quick shootout, the report said. It was not clear how <PERSON> Li </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shang </PERSON> obtained live ammunition for the starter pistols as it can not legally be bought in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Warsaw Pact Publishes Figures, Claims Near Parity with NATO</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has published its most detailed breakdown ever of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in an effort to rebut Western claims that the Soviet bloc has a clear advantage over the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance. The breakdown in Monday's edition of Pravda, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, did not however account for differences between East and West over how to interpret the figures. Those differences have for 15 years stymied negotiations on reducing conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. In its statement, the Soviet bloc acknowledges having twice as many tanks in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> _ far below the 3-1 advantage alleged by the West _ but claims the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> has the advantage in attack aircraft and personnel. Hence, the Soviets asserted, the strength of the two sides is about equal. Western experts did not agree. `` It is clear that the idea of a rough parity of forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> does not correspond to the factual situation,'' said <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sloan </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON>, the alliance's American military commander, declared: `` I definitely do not agree that a rough parity of conventional forces already exists in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact defense ministers said in a statement that the figures add up to `` rough parity'' in conventional forces. They said the Western alliance has issued `` tendentious data based on a selective approach.'' New negotiations on conventional forces are to begin March 7 in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. Those talks were given a boost Dec. 7 when President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> would reduce the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> by half a million soldiers by 1991. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> also says it will get rid of 10,000 tanks, 8,500 artillery systems and 800 combat planes. The other <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> countries _ <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> _ have also announced cuts in their military forces. Pravda's report said the 16-nation <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance has 2.1 million ground troops in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> facing 1.8 million from the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact countries, and 685,000 sailors in nearby seas compared to only 338,000 for the East bloc. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> contends the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact has 3.1 million ground troops, while the alliance has 2.2 million. The Pravda report acknowledged a 2-1 <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact advantage in tanks, and its tables also showed a heavy advantage for the East in armored personnel carriers and combat infantry vehicles. A Western analyst in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> said privately that the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact appeared to have tailored the categories of forces to support its long-standing contention that the sides are about equal. He noted that <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> contends the Eastern alliance has qualitative superiority in virtually every major weapons system. Sample comparative figures illustrate the differences in strength estimates. The report in <LOCATION> Pravda </LOCATION> says the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact has 59,470 tanks to 30,690 for <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, but the Western alliance says the figures are 51,500 to 16,424. Although the Soviets say the West has a dramatic advantage in strike aircraft and helicopters, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> says the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> has a comfortable edge. <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact figures say <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> has superior numbers of ground troops, air forces, navy personnel, strike aircraft, helicopters and large surface ships, while the East is ahead in tanks, tactical missile launchers, interceptor aircraft, artillery and infantry vehicles and armored personnel carriers. In its November report on troops in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> had more soldiers, main battle tanks, armored infantry fighting vehicles, artillery, anti-tank weapons, air defense systems, helicopters, combat aircraft and armored vehicle launched bridges. That report did not include naval forces, which <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> said `` are capable of global deployment, and this makes it artificial to identify specific numbers of ships associated with any one region.'' Analysts generally feel the West has a qualitative edge in tactical aircraft and naval forces, neither of which is to be included in the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> negotiations.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has chosen former Soviet prisoner and human rights activist <PERSON> Natan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> to be <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s new ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, a senior government official said today. News of the choice raised concern among some Israeli diplomats about the possibility of offending the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> at a time when relations with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, broken off more than 20 years ago, are improving. A senior government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s selection of <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> was expected to get the necessary approval from Finance Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, head of the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Labor shares power with <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc in the coalition government. <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON>, 41, served nine years of a 13-year sentence in Soviet prisons and labor camps on charges of spying. He was released Feb. 11, 1986 as part of an East-West prisoner exchange and flew immediately to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to join his wife, <PERSON> Avital </PERSON>. He was arrested in 1977 after angering the Soviet authorities as an outspoken leader of the Jewish emigration movement and for maintaining numerous foreign contacts. <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> also belonged to a human rights watch committee headed by <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> that was sharply critical of Kremlin policies toward prisoners and national minorities. The outspoken <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON>, interviewed today on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> army radio, would not comment on the report, saying only he had not been officially offered the job. Pressed by the interviewer, <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> added: `` I will say only what I want to say. I have enough experience with interrogations and I know how to give answers. I have had no formal proposal.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s surprise choice of <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> followed a recommendation from former U.N. Ambassador <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON>, now deputy foreign minister and a legislator of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has not replaced <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON> since he left the post last year. The government official said the process of appointing <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> could be delayed as <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> diplomats study the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s response `` Now that we're on the eve of renewing diplomatic ties, on such a delicate time in our relations with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, it could take some time to determine whether this would not offend them,'' he said. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, one of the first countries to recognize the new state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 1948, severed diplomatic ties during the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war when <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized lands from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> allies. Ties have warmed over the past two years, with both countries exchanging low-level diplomats or consular officials. Since arriving in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> has lobbied to improve conditions for Soviet immigrants. He also changed his first name from the Russian <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> to the Hebrew Natan. <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> has turned down bids to join any of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s major political parties. He and his wife have two daughters _ <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON>, 2, and <PERSON> Hannah </PERSON>, two months. Soviet Jewry activists praised the choice of <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> for the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> post. `` This is a good way for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to use his talents,'' said <PERSON> Yuli </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelstein </PERSON>, a colleague of <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON>'s who immigrated from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> two years ago.

<HEAD>Police Find Eight Labs, 2,310 Pounds of Cocaine, Destroy 44 Runways</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In a new offensive against drug traffickers, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s narcotics police destroyed eight cocaine laboratories, 2,310 pounds of cocaine and 44 runways in remote areas, the national police chief said. The raids, all in jungle areas, occurred last weekend as part of Operation Springtime, Gen. <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> said in a news release on Monday. <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> took over the national police last month in one of the frequent changes of command in government security forces. New police commanders frequently come on strong with a series of raids. Eight people, who had all made just a few dollars a day as laborers at the cocaine processing labs, were arrested in the weekend raids, <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> said. Not one of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s dozen major cocaine bosses has ever been arrested on drug trafficking charges and convicted in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. An average of two dozen cocaine processing labs are destroyed in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> each year, and scores of clandestine runways are bombed by the air force. New labs and new runways appear within weeks. A police colonel told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> last year that there probably were more than 500 clandestine runways in use by drug traffickers in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> at any given time. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government gives about $ 15 million worth of aid to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> each year in the form of equipment and training to fight drug trafficking. Colombian narcotics officials have suggested privately that $ 15 million dollars does not go far toward stopping the multibillion-dollar illegal cocaine trafficking in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. Scores of helicopters and thousands of police would be needed to deal effectively with the problem, the officials have said privately.

 Gentle country crooner <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Travis </PERSON> and stylish crossover singer <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> dominated the American Music Awards, where heavy metal rowdiness and rap jive earned only limited acceptance. The Shrine Auditorium nationally televised ceremonies Monday night ushered in first-time categories for heavy metal and rap, which enjoy widespread youth culture popularity. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> and <PERSON> Travis </PERSON> each won three trophies and diversity reigned in the winners list with artists like <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> <PERSON> Houston </PERSON>, <PERSON> Def </PERSON> <PERSON> Leppard </PERSON>, D.J. <ORGANIZATION> Jazzy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jeff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; The Fresh Prince, <PERSON> Gladys </PERSON> <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> and Guns N' Roses. <PERSON> Def </PERSON> <PERSON> Leppard </PERSON>, who did n't attend the ceremony despite three nominations, won two trophies for heavy metal music but lost with <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Halen </PERSON> to <ORGANIZATION> Gloria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estefan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sound </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machine </ORGANIZATION> in the pop-rock group category. Guns N' Roses lost to Def Leppard twice in heavy metal but won for pop-rock single. The lethargic performance by the tattooed, long-haired ruffians Guns N' Roses, who were joined by ex-Eagle <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Henley </PERSON>, contrasted sharply with the show's other flashy, professional numbers. Their bad-boy persona also did n't endear them to show producer <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, who was forced to move <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>'s performance ahead of schedule because <ORGANIZATION> Guns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> N </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roses </ORGANIZATION> showed up late. <PERSON> Travis </PERSON> was named favorite male country vocalist and won the album trophy for `` Always & amp; Forever'' and the single award for `` I Told You So.'' He won in three categories last year for the same album. Asked about milking awards twice from the same album, he said backstage, `` I'm not sure how that happened but I'm glad it did.'' Unlike Grammy Awards decided by artists and industry insiders, 20,000 ordinary music lovers are the arbiters for American Music Awards. Because `` Always & amp; Forever'' spanned two calendar years, it was eligible twice. It happened before. <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>'s `` Rhinestone Cowboy'' won in 1976-77, <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>' `` The Gambler'' in 1980-81 and the <LOCATION> Rogers-Dolly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parton </LOCATION> duet `` Islands in the Stream'' got a two-year ride in 1984-85. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, formerly of the group Wham!, was favorite male vocalist in the pop-rock and the soul-rhythm-and-blues categories. His album `` Faith'' claimed the soul-R & amp; B album award. `` A couple of years back when I split the group with <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Ridgely </PERSON> -RRB-, I knew I had a tough job ahead of me and I thought that maybe people were n't going to give me much of a chance,'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> told the audience. Miss <PERSON> Houston </PERSON> won the female pop-rock and rhythm-and-blues vocalist categories, her 10th and 11th American Music Awards, and <ORGANIZATION> Miss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estefan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sound </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machine </ORGANIZATION>'s Latin beat got them the pop-rock group award. `` I never expected to win this,'' said Miss <PERSON> Estefan </PERSON>. `` It's wonderful to be able to cross over to a whole new market and to have everyone from all walks of life like our music. <PERSON> Gladys </PERSON> <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> & amp; The Pips, who dominated the awards in 1976 with four trophies, beat out hot new acts New Edition and <ORGANIZATION> Salt-N-Pepa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> R </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; B group honors. <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> won its seventh consecutive country group trophy. Def Leppard swept the heavy metal category as favorite artist and for the album `` Hysteria.'' The new rap category went to favorite artist <ORGANIZATION> Jazzy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jeff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; The Fresh <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> and his album `` He's The D.J., I'm The Rapper.'' <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, who led Grammy nominations earlier this month with six, was the favorite new pop-rock artist but did not appear to claim the trophy. The `` Dirty Dancing'' movie soundtrack won favorite pop-rock album. Highlighting the three-hour <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION> presentation were tributes to <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, who were given non-competitive trophies for personal achievement. A brief segment also honored three artists who died last year _ <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Orbison </PERSON>, <PERSON> Brook </PERSON> <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibb </PERSON>. `` I would first like to thank God, who makes all things possible,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. Guns N' Roses won best pop-rock single for `` Sweet Child O' Mine'' and <PERSON> Freddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s `` Nice' N' Slow'' took the R & amp; B single award The favorite new R & amp; B artist was Al B. Sure!, a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> native. <PERSON> Reba </PERSON> <PERSON> McEntire </PERSON> won favorite female country singer, and <PERSON> Patty </PERSON> <PERSON> Loveless </PERSON> was favorite new country artist. Names of nominees were compiled from year-end sales charts of the music industry trade publication Cash Box. Winners were selected by a polling of 20,000 people who receive ballots sent by <ORGANIZATION> Herbert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Altman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The ballots are counted by the Peat, <ORGANIZATION> Marwick </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mitchell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> accounting firm. The Grammy Awards will be handed out Feb. 22.

<TEXT>
 We arrived at a verdict in the <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> murder trial in our eighth day of deliberations because for a short period on Monday I abdicated my position as chairman of the group. That action enabled the last holdout -LRB- against a guilty verdict for first-degree manslaughter -RRB- to participate more fully in the deliberations. That person and I had had some friction, some conflict and another person's assumption of the chair enabled the holdout to participate without dealing with me. The timing for this action was right. It could not have been done any sooner. I knew before the testimony was half over that there was enormous potential for a hung jury. I could sense it in the people. I thought there would be a hung jury. This was because of the complexity of the case and the circumstantial nature of the evidence. It was clear from the beginning that the only possibility of arriving at a verdict was to keep everyone talking, avoid for a time the areas of greatest conflict, and try to find things we could agree on. We did not take a vote right away when we began deliberations. An immediate vote would have made the jurors feel locked into a position. I felt that we should start with as many facts that seemed to have significance that we could agree on. There were unmistakable indications at the beginning of our deliberations that we were almost hopelessly divided. There were three who indicated that it was more probable that <PERSON> Hedda </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s live-in lover -RRB- had done it -LRB- fatally injured <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> -RRB- than that <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> had done it. But they were not putting forth their case. They never made any effort to convince anyone of their point of view. They thought it was enough that they had this point of view. Essentially, their position was, `` I do n't think <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> did it and that's it.'' They did n't understand how a jury works and comes to a consensus. There were two other groups who were generally willing to argue their positions. There were four in the Joel-is-guilty group. And about five were in what basically is a middle group that was undecided. They always felt they should try to convince the other people of the positions they were holding. The defense strategy changed several times during the trial and that internal inconsistency weakened their case. Only two people could have killed <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>. If <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> knows <PERSON> Hedda </PERSON> did it, then what's all this stuff about <PERSON> Reye </PERSON>'s syndrome -LRB- which the defense at one point contended was the cause of death -RRB-. I could have easily entertained a defense of insanity. And there was another juror who was in the Joel-is-guilty camp who said she would have been open to an insanity defense. He left the child on the bathroom floor when he went out to dinner. Then he comes home and uses cocaine. There was some casual speculation by us about why they did n't put on an insanity defense. The people who believed <PERSON> Hedda </PERSON> had done it used <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON>'s testimony -LRB- who said she saw Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> slap <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> -RRB- in their own arguments They were taking it into account in support of their case. Eventually, we voted unanimously a `` not guilty'' verdict on the murder count. This was a very difficult vote for several jurors who may have done so in order to avoid a hung jury. There were hundreds of times when tension was relieved by joking. There were only about four times when people almost came to blows. I think that if I look deeply into my heart, I would say there were people -LRB- jurors -RRB- I did not trust and some I did not hold in great respect. Over time, I came to change my opinion about some of the people. In the final analysis, everything we accomplished was as a result of the two things we had in common, a sense of humor and a great willingness to work together. One of the court officers said that we were the loudest and funniest jury he had ever observed. The noise, the running jokes, and the laughter were our way of letting off steam during and after our many long tense emotional deliberations. There was an enormous amount of affection in that jury room _ I would say a form of love. This jury was an extraordinarily diverse group of people. I think it's fair to say that despite all of our differences of background and of opinion, we became a family _ so much so that we are planning a reunion in March.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, who faced four homicide counts in the death of his 6-year-old illegally adopted daughter, <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>, was acquitted of the most serious charge and convicted of the second-most serious. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> was charged with second-degree murder, which would have required a finding by the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury that he had recklessly struck the girl and then showed depraved indifference to her life by failing to get medical help. The jury acquitted him of that charge, which carries a sentence of 25 years to life in prison. The charge on which <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> was convicted _ first-degree manslaughter _ required the jury to find that he intended to cause serious physical harm to the girl, and that the injury caused her death. The charge carries a maximum penalty of 8 1 @ 3 to 25 years in prison. The judge had instructed the jury it could infer that <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> intended to cause the injury `` by the results produced by his act.'' But if they found his use of cocaine had so dulled his awareness that he could not form intent, they were to find him innocent of first-degree manslaughter. The jury did not need to consider the two lesser charges: second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. The former requires action that is reckless but not with depraved indifference. It carries a five-to-15-year prison sentence. The latter covers situations in which a death is caused by someone who fails to perceive the risk of his actions. It carries a term of 1 1 @ 3 to four years.

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Shouting `` Yankee go home,'' dozens of radical students hurled firebombs today at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cultural center in <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said. It was the second such attack this month. About 30 firebombs were thrown, but none landed inside the compound, said an official at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. The official, who requesting anonymity, said there were no injuries or damage. About 50 students shouted anti-U.S. slogans as they dashed out of alleys and hurled dozens of firebombs and rocks toward the center, the <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. Most of the bombs landed on the street, it said. `` Drive out <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION> who manipulated the <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> massacre,'' <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> quoted students as shouting. They also chanted `` Shut down the <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> center'' and `` Punish -LRB- former President -RRB- <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON> and -LRB- President -RRB- <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo,'' the agency said. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> was elected in December 1987 and replaced <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, who stepped down after seven years of authoritarian rule and played a leading role in the brutal military suppression of the 1980 <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> uprising. About 100 riot police guarding the center charged at the attackers, firing tear gas, and chased them away in a few minutes, <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> said. The agency did not say whether any students were arrested. On Jan. 18, about 50 students attacked the center with sledgehammers, rocks and firebombs and broke windows. No one was hurt. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, who say the center has been attacked eight times in the past last year by radical students, today denied reports that they have decided to close it. But they said the facility could close if the attacks continue. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been seeking promises from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> authorities that they will provide adequate protection for the <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> center and its staff. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cultural centers in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pusan </LOCATION> have also been attacked, but not as frequently as the <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> center. The centers have libraries and occassionaly offer speaker programs. Anti-U.S. sentiment is relatively high in <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>, an opposition stronghold 180 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, because of the suppression of the 1980 pro-democracy civil uprising in the southern city. By official count, about 200 people were killed and more than 1,000 injured or wounded as government troops put down the nine-day armed revolt. Many opposition and dissident figures claim the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was involved in the <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> incident by supporting a South Korean government plan to quell the uprising ruthlessly. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has denied any involvement in the incident and agreed to submit written testimony from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> lawmakers who are conducting parliamentary investigations into misdeeds committed under <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has 42,000 troops stationed in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> under a mutual defense treaty and many radical students want the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers to leave.

<HEAD>Hurricane-Force Winds Blast Through Montana</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Hurricane-force winds that toppled railroad cars howled through <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> today as the cold air that caused <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s historic cold snap headed for the lower 48 states after high-temperature records were set or tied in 16 places. The winds, accompanied by snow in some places, gusted more than 100 mph along the east slopes of the <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rockies </LOCATION>, overturning a freight train and blowing over grain elevators. No injuries were reported. <LOCATION> Choteau </LOCATION> reported a gust of 124 mph. The winds were expected to spread to <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> today. Moving behind the cold front generating the wind and snow was the massive dome of cold air that caused the two-week Alaskan cold spell. Temperatures were expected to drop well below zero by Wednesday in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. The high-pressure zone over <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> set a North American record Monday for the highest pressure ever recorded: 31.58 inches at <LOCATION> Bettles </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. The old record of 31.53 inches was set Jan. 1, 1974, over the <ORGANIZATION> Yukon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Territory </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>.

In <LOCATION> Marquette </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, the temperature hit 37 degrees early today, breaking the high-temperature record for the date of 36 degrees set in 1964. It was the fifth day in a row records were broken or tied in that city. High-temperature records were set Monday in 13 Western and <LOCATION> Midwestern </LOCATION> cities, including <LOCATION> Rapid </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, where the balmy 72-degree reading surpassed by 3 degrees the mark for the date set in 1892. It was 67 degrees in <LOCATION> Scottsbluff </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, breaking the 66-degree record set in 1911 and 62 degrees in <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, breaking the 1962 record of 61. Records were tied in three other places. Today's forecast called for rain in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>, with snow in the mountains; snow from the northern <LOCATION> Rockies </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, northern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and upper <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>; scattered rain showers in the lower <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, with snow in northern <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>; and continuing strong, gusty winds in the northern and central Rockies.

 <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> had been afraid to go out at night because of sniper attacks near her home. Then she learned that her tenant had confessed to the crimes. `` And here he is living in my house,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> exclaimed Monday after authorities said self-styled commando <PERSON> Yusef </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON> had confessed to one killing and sniper attacks that wounded three people on eastern <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. `` I've been sitting here all morning shaking my head back and forth,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said. `` I ca n't believe it.'' <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON> also has admitted to three killings in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, authorities said. `` There is some indication that he wanted to kill all the drug dealers in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>,'' <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> police Sgt. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Edlund </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> police reported getting telephone calls following the <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> attacks in which the caller said his victims were `` drug dealers and crooked cops,'' but police said there was no evidence that the shootings were drug related. Police arrested <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON> on Saturday, six days after weapons found in a car in <LOCATION> Southampton </LOCATION> were linked to him and the sniper attacks. Police said <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON> told them that he began to play army combat games when he was 6 years old, bought his first real gun when he was 14 and killed someone four years later. `` It appears that he enjoyed killing,'' said <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazzei </PERSON>, deputy chief of the district attorney's homicide bureau. `` He got his kicks out of playing army and shooting people.'' In written and videotaped confessions after his arrest, <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON> said he frequently went into the woods to practice combat training maneuvers. On Dec. 5, the day of the first <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> shooting, <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON> said he was `` running and crawling'' in the woods when he encountered a dog, which he shot. He said he then saw the dog's owner, <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Heaney </PERSON>. `` I opened up on him,'' <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON> said in the police confession. Police said <PERSON> Heaney </PERSON> was shot to death with a .22 - caliber In three other attacks in which people were wounded, <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON> apparently chose his victims at random, firing into their home windows before riding away on his bicycle. In his final attack, <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON> shot the emergency lights out of a police patrol car but no one was injured. Friends in the lower income neighborhood in <LOCATION> Riverhead </LOCATION> where <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON> has rented a room since August described him as an extremely quiet, devout <PERSON> Muslim </PERSON>. `` They seem to be talking about a different person than who lived here,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said of police. `` He was very mannerly and respectful.'' <PERSON> Mazzei </PERSON> said <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON> told police he knew his actions were wrong and expressed remorse for his actions. `` There is no question there is a sickness involved but we do n't believe he was legally insane,'' he said The case is to be presented to a grand jury later this week. <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON> was placed on a suicide watch at the <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jail, where he is being held without bail, Warden <PERSON> Salvatore </PERSON> <PERSON> Romano </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Television evangelist <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> has accused Penthouse magazine of trying to destroy his ministry through a `` diabolical and slanderous'' story in which a stripper says she performed sexual acts for him. The stripper's employer labeled the woman's allegations, detailed in the magazine's current issue, `` a pornographic fairy tale.'' As <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> threatened to file a libel suit Monday, the magazine said it was standing by its article. The allegations by the woman, <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kampen </PERSON>, are similar to those levied last year by a prostitute, <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphree </PERSON>. Those allegations led to <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s ouster from the Assemblies of God, a Pentecostal denomination, and a major downturn in the fortunes of <ORGANIZATION> Jimmy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swaggart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION>. `` There is not one shred of truth to these allegations. I have never met or seen the woman,'' <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> said at a news conference at his ministry headquarters. `` Our attorneys learned of this fraudulent story in December and had clearly shown Penthouse and its porno writer, <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> -LRB- the author -RRB-, that the story was untrue,'' <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> said. `` We now know that they already knew and did not care that it was a lie.'' Penthouse spokesman <PERSON> Sy </PERSON> <PERSON> Presten </PERSON> issued a statement for publisher <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Guccione </PERSON> saying the magazine stood behind the story. `` The fact that she was with <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> has been corroborated by her husband and others in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>,'' the statement said. `` The things she reports <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> made her do are very similar to the story of <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphree </PERSON> ... which have never been contradicted.'' <PERSON> Kampen </PERSON>, 38, was quoted in <LOCATION> Penthouse </LOCATION> as saying <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> gained her trust with his counseling, then emotionally manipulated her into acting out sexual fantasies. She was reported to be in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for promotional appearances about the article and could not be reached for additional comment. <PERSON> Rhonda </PERSON> <PERSON> Shear </PERSON>, co-owner of `` Hot Lines,'' a strip-tease telegram service that employs <PERSON> Kampen </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, said her sister, <PERSON> Nona </PERSON>, told her that <PERSON> Kampen </PERSON> made up the story after seeing the Penthouse account of <PERSON> Murphree </PERSON>'s relations with <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>. `` She told my sister it was all concocted,'' <PERSON> Shear </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` She saw the issue with <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphree </PERSON> -LRB- and said -RRB- ... ` It's only a matter of time before someone jumps on that band wagon. Why not me?' ... She said it was foolproof if she said it happened at her house.'' Shear's sister, contacted in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, said a lawyer had advised her not to comment. She refused to confirm her sister's story At the news conference, <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> accused Penthouse of conspiring to destroy his ministry and asked for public support. `` I am appealing to the American people, and especially the Christians, to help us by letting the pornographers know they have filled this land with their filth far too long. There seems to be no end to their diabolical slander.'' Attorney <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON>, a member of the ministries' board of directors, said Monday that a lawsuit would be filed within the next few days in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where punitive damages are permitted in libel actions. Last February, <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> confessed to an undisclosed sin, and <PERSON> Murphree </PERSON> said she had been paid by the evangelist to perform sex acts while he watched. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> later was defrocked by the Assemblies of God after refusing to step down from the pulpit for at least a year. The furor resulted in the cancellation of <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s programs from three major cable television networks, an exodus of students and faculty from his Bible college and layoffs from the ministry, a major <ORGANIZATION> Baton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> employer.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> ship collided with a Japanese whaling vessel today off <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> in the most serious incident since the environmental group began a campaign a week ago to stop the whale hunt. The Japanese ship, Nisshin Maru No. 3, sustained minor damage to its hand rails while the <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> ship <LOCATION> Gondwana </LOCATION> was not damaged, said <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON>. There were no injuries, he said. <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON>, speaking from the <LOCATION> Gondwana </LOCATION> by radio telephone, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the 1,435-ton <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> ship was in a `` perfectly legitimate position'' when the vessels collided. In <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION>'s coordinator for <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> <PERSON> Lyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldsworthy </PERSON> said: `` The Japanese ship used an iron grappling hook and attached it to the <LOCATION> Gondwana </LOCATION> to pull it out of the way. In the maneuvering that resulted the Japanese boat collided with <LOCATION> Gondwana </LOCATION>.'' Immediately after the collision, <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> said, there was a flood of communications between the skippers of both ships. `` The Japanese told us to stay away and keep a distance of at least 300 yards,'' he said. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has said it plans to take 300 whales this year as part of its scientific research to determine the size of whale stocks _ despite a moratorium imposed by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Whaling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> contends most of the whale meat will end up in sushi restaurants in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, a whaling official said today that attempts by the environmental group to block Japanese ships from whaling in the Antarctic are endangering the lives of the crewmen and amount to terrorism. `` This is terrorism, the same as that opposed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other countries,'' said <PERSON> Takehiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Takayama </PERSON> of the Tokyo-based <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Whaling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` They have no concern about human life.'' <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> said that after the collision, the <LOCATION> Gondwana </LOCATION>, carrying a crew of 19, launched inflatable dinghies into the icy waters in an effort to prevent the loading of harpooned whales onto the factory ship. `` They then turned water hoses on us,'' he said. <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON>, a veteran of <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> expeditions, said the <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> vessel later chased several Japanese catcher ships whose crews were hunting for whales with explosive harpoons. He estimated that Japanese harpooners already have taken between 50 and 55 Minke whales this season, about 10 of them since the <LOCATION> Gondwana </LOCATION> caught up with the whaling fleet a week ago. <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> would continue harassing the Japanese whaling fleet for several more days. `` The whales do n't belong to the Japanese,'' he said. `` They belong to all of us.''

 Four men have been convicted and jailed for stealing at least $ 53 million in cash, gold, silver, gems and other valuables in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s biggest robbery. Police say about two-thirds of the haul is missing. <PERSON> Valerio </PERSON> <PERSON> Viccei </PERSON>, the 34-year-old Italian who masterminded the robbery at a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> safe deposit center, was sentenced to 22 years in jail on Monday after the two-month jury trial at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Old </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bailey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Detectives, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they thought <PERSON> Viccei </PERSON>, who had most of a month to dispose of the haul before he was arrested, still controls much of it. One <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard detective said: `` He is set for a very comfortable retirement when he gets out'' of prison. Assisted by <PERSON> Parvez </PERSON> <PERSON> Latiff </PERSON>, the 32-year-old debt-ridden owner of the safe deposit center, the gang broke into 120 deposit boxes on July 12, 1987 and stole enough valuables to fill a bathtub at their hideout, prosecutor <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Amlot </PERSON> told the jury. <PERSON> Viccei </PERSON> and an accomplice had posed as customers at the safe deposit center across from <ORGANIZATION> Harrods </ORGANIZATION> department store in the expensive <LOCATION> Knightsbridge </LOCATION> area. Once inside, they pulled guns on security guards and on Latiff, who concealed his involvement. The gang members then spent two hours breaking open boxes, taking goods such as a 40-carat diamond, since recovered, belonging to the wife of West German industrialist <PERSON> Gerd </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Flick </PERSON>. One robber cried, `` Bingo,'' when he opened a box containing $ 265,000 worth of cocaine, the court heard. But <PERSON> Viccei </PERSON> cut his finger on one box, took off his glove, and left a fingerprint, which allowed police to arrest him a week before he planned to flee to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Viccei </PERSON> estimated the haul was worth $ 70 million and detectives said it was worth at least $ 53 million. Latiff, who had been promised one-third of the haul, was sentenced to 18 years in prison for robbery and five years concurrently for possessing a gun. One accomplice, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Poole </PERSON>, was given 16 years with a five-year concurrent sentence. Another, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Donohue </PERSON>, was sentenced today to 11 years in jail. `` Some you win, some you lose,'' <PERSON> O'Donohue </PERSON> said as he was led from the court. <PERSON> Viccei </PERSON> also received a concurrent 12-year term for a firearms offense. Police said about $ 17 million worth of the haul has been recovered. They said about $ 12 million worth of this will be returned to owners but that about $ 5 million worth remains unclaimed. Police think many of the mainly foreign owners may not have claimed items of stolen property because they want to conceal the full extent of their wealth for political, tax or other reasons. Once any appeals or subsequent trials have been dealt with, the unclaimed goods will be auctioned off for charity, police said. Insurance companies have contacted detectives to authenticate claims and losers can not claim for more than they admitted to police. One detective said: `` We think a lot of people have lost property they never told anyone about.'' <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s previous biggest robbery was the theft of gold, platinum, diamonds and travelers checks worth a total of $ 46 million from a Brinks Mat warehouse near <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> airport on Nov. 26, 1983. The Guinness Book of Records says the world's greatest robbery was the theft of the equivalent of $ 4.4 billion in present day values from the <ORGANIZATION> Reichsbank </ORGANIZATION> following the collapse of <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in 1945.

 <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers fought with youths who threw stones and hoisted outlawed <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags today during another general strike in the occupied territories, and 17 Arabs were reported shot and wounded. Also today, a fundamentalist Moslem leader in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> said he would back elections in the territories under international supervision and would be willing to meet with Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>. The minister has proposed a peace plan that includes such elections. Today's general strike, which shut businesses and halted transport, was called by the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising leaders, who are backed by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. On Monday, <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> activists persuaded Palestinians to ignore calls for a work stoppage ordered by a rival Moslem extremist group, <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION>. Arab doctors said 17 Palestinians were shot and wounded in clashes throughout the territories. The army said it was checking reported casualties. The worst clash was in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>'s Jabaliya refugee camp, where residents hung 10 outlawed <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags from utility poles, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. Nine Palestinian youths, including a 13-year-old, were shot and wounded, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> doctors said. A 75-year-old woman was shot in the face during a clash with soldiers in a village near the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Jenin </LOCATION>, said doctors at <LOCATION> Al-Ittihad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Another senior military officer told <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders today <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s economic and political crisis is threatening to break apart the nation and that the army might intervene. Vice Adm. <PERSON> Stane </PERSON> <PERSON> Brovet </PERSON> told the session of the policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that in some parts of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> `` the situation is escaping control ... -LRB- and the country's -RRB- territorial integrity and constitutional order are being jeopardized.'' Protesters in a wave of mass demonstrations in past months have demanded sweeping changes in party leadership. `` Forces that wish the destruction of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> through non-institutional -LRB- illegal -RRB- methods are appearing on the scene,'' <PERSON> Brovet </PERSON> said. `` <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> can survive only as a true federation ... and the forces which are working toward the breakup of such a <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> should be prevented primarily by political but also by all other means,'' he said without elaborating. His comments followed a similar warning Monday. `` What some describe as the battle for <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> will not be waged without the Yugoslav army,'' declared Adm. <PERSON> Petar </PERSON> <PERSON> Simic </PERSON>, a member of the ruling Politburo and the military's chief political officer. <PERSON> Simic </PERSON> called for party unity at the plenary session of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Liberal and hard-liner committee members have been clashing over how to cope with 250 percent inflation, a sharp drop in living standards and an alarming increase in labor and ethnic unrest. The army generally has remained on the sidelines in the struggle to end the country's woes that pits advocates of greater democracy against supporters of a more centralized communist system. But senior officers are now showing signs of increasing unease, and <PERSON> Simic </PERSON> indicated the military _ with an estimated combined strength of about 200,000 _ might take a more active role `` in putting a stop to confrontations between the republics.'' `` The crisis in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> is rapidly approaching its culmination,'' <PERSON> Simic </PERSON> said, adding that the party is `` losing battle after battle'' as the `` political system is breaking apart.'' The army is `` stable and prepared to fulfill its role and purpose,'' he said. The Central Committee session was convened to discuss calls for the resignation of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader, <PERSON> Stipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON>, a liberal-minded Croat who favors greater decentralization of the economy. It was expected to be the scene of a showdown between liberals and the hardline coalition led by <PERSON> Slobodan </PERSON> <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>, the ambitious party chief of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, the largest of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s six loosely federated republics. <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON> told committee members Monday that <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> must now choose between more democracy and `` neo-Stalinism.'' He also lashed out at <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>, his chief political rival, not mentioning the Serbian party boss by name but attacking the politics of centralized control favored by <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>. <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> on Monday called for sweeping personnel changes in the country's leadership, which he blamed for the current crisis. `` It would be honest and intelligent that those who have clashed with the people should allow themselves to be replaced by better and more capable men,'' he said. <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>, who has called for more centralized party control over the country's affairs, draws his support from <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s poorer southern regions. In those areas, people fear that market-oriented economic reforms could lead to massive layoffs if they cause unprofitable enterprises to forfeit state subsidies. Suvar is supported by <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s most liberal and Westernized republic, <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>, and his native <LOCATION> Croatia </LOCATION>, which favor more democracy and radical market-oriented reforms as a solution to the country's protracted crisis. <PERSON> Milan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kucan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>'s party chief, warned Monday that `` <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> is practically falling apart.'' The country of 23 million people, its living standard in steep decline since 1980, experienced thousands of strikes last year and unemployment reached 15 percent. Since the death in 1980 of <PERSON> Josip </PERSON> <PERSON> Broz </PERSON> <PERSON> Tito </PERSON>, the strong-willed founder of communist <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, an eight-man rotating presidency has headed the country under the guidance of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The system balances the country's competing ethnic groups.

 Afrikaner political leaders hope to raise $ 420,000 to build a monument honoring former Prime Minister <PERSON> Hendrik </PERSON> <PERSON> Verwoerd </PERSON>, one of the principal architects of apartheid. State-run South African <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said a site has been set aside for the monument in downtown <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>, the administrative capital.

 <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> was convicted of beating to death his illegally adopted daughter, but jurors rejected a murder charge because his live-in companion `` could have saved <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'s life'' during nearly 12 hours she lay comatose on a bathroom floor. Eight days of heated deliberations ended Monday when the jury reached the manslaughter verdict in the case that focused national attention on domestic violence and the question of who should report cases of suspected child abuse. By acquitting <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> of second-degree murder, the jurors decided that the disbarred lawyer had not shown `` depraved indifference to human life'' when he struck 6-year-old <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> in a rage in November 1987. `` It's a sad day for the kids who are being abused in this country,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Fontana </PERSON>, chairman of the Mayor's <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> on Child Abuse, who believed <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> was guilty of murder. `` The child protective system failed -LRB- <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> -RRB-, the school system failed her, and now the judicial system has failed her.'' District Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgenthau </PERSON> promised to seek the maximum 8 1 @ 3-to-25-year prison sentence for the first-degree manslaughter conviction, which required the jury to find that he intended to cause <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> serious harm. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, 47, faces sentencing March 8. `` <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> has shown himself to fully deserve that sentence,'' <PERSON> Morgenthau </PERSON> said, adding: The case `` highlighted the dreadful problems that beset our city _ child abuse, drug abuse and family violence. All of us have a responsibility to work to ensure that similar tragedies do not reoccur.'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> was stoic as the verdict was announced, ending a three-month trial in a case that spun a web of drugs and domestic violence from behind the facade of a quiet <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> building. `` He did not say anything,'' said <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s attorney, <LOCATION> Ira </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. `` He did not do anything. `` We do not consider this -LRB- verdict -RRB- a win for <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> or a triumph for <PERSON> Joel </PERSON>,'' said <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said an appeal is planned based in part on the showing of a graphic videotape of injuries suffered by <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s former companion, <PERSON> Hedda </PERSON> <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>. He has called the tape prejudiced and inflammatory. <PERSON> Michele </PERSON> <PERSON> Launders </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'s 27-year-old biological mother, fled the courtroom in tears and would not speak to reporters after the verdict. Just before the announcement, she said, `` The only verdict that would be justice for <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> is murder.'' She had been sitting next to <PERSON> Graceann </PERSON> <PERSON> Smigiel </PERSON>, the grandmother of a then-16-month-old boy who was found in <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s apartment, tethered to a crib and drinking spoiled milk, when police and paramedics removed <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'s comastose body on the morning of Nov. 2, 1987. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> were charged with <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'s death but Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> testified under immunity as the star prosecution witness. Publicity about the case reached a peak during Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>'s emotionally wrenching testimony in December, when local television stations gave gavel-to-gavel coverage and <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> broadcast extensive chunks of her testimony nationwide During seven days of testimony, she said she was so dominated by <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> that she was unable to defend herself from virtually systematic beatings, or to protect <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>. She said that <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> told her in bed on the night of Nov. 1, 1987, after they had free-based cocaine and while <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> lay comatose on their bathroom floor, that he had `` knocked <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> down and she did n't want to get up.'' She said she was unable to bring herself to summon help promptly. The girl lay there nearly 12 hours before Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> called an ambulance; she died of brain damage in a hospital three days later. Juror <PERSON> Helena </PERSON> <PERSON> Barthell </PERSON> said the panel `` virtually ignored'' the testimony, which was sharply challenged by defense lawyers who stressed Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>'s responsibility in <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'s death. `` <PERSON> Hedda </PERSON> <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> could have saved <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'s life if she had made that call'' for medical assistance, Mrs. <PERSON> Barthell </PERSON> said. She also said the manslaughter charge was a compromise, with some jurors arguing for the murder charge and some leaning toward lesser charges. A murder conviction, she conceded, `` certainly ... would have sent a stronger message.'' Deliberations had been so heated that jurors nearly came to blows four times, said foreman <PERSON> Jeremiah </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, who asked the court for a few minutes to `` kiss and make up'' before the verdict was announced. Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheck </PERSON>, said his client is `` relieved it's all over.'' He said she watched the verdict on television at the psychiatric hospital where she has lived since March. `` The possibility of a hung jury was a very frightening prospect for her. She would have to go through this all again,'' he said. Defense lawyers claimed it was Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> who fatally beat <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> out of jealousy over the attention <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> paid the child. Prosecutors _ pointing to Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>'s own severe injuries and deteriorated mental state _ said she was incapable of such an act. Nonetheless, state judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothwax </PERSON> instructed the jury to consider Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> an accomplice. As such, her testimony had to be supported by other evidence to secure a murder conviction. One question was how Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, a former children's book editor for <ORGANIZATION> Random </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, could allow herself _ much less the child _ to sustain such damage. Another was how bruises on <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> could have been noticed by a student teacher at her elementary school and by neighbors, but failed to come to the attention of child welfare officials. Yet another issue was the ease with which <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> illegally gained custody of <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> and the other child, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, from their unwed teen-age mothers. The boy has been reunited with his biological mother. At the center of the case were the unknown motivations of <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, who was disbarred last fall for having falsely claimed a military exemption from the bar exam. He did not testify at the trial. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s lack of concern for the girl exhibited `` more than depraved indifference to human life,'' Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Casolaro </PERSON> said at the trial. `` It was monumental indifference to human life.''

<TEXT>
 City conservatives shunned ultra-rightists who made a surprisingly strong showing in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> elections and instead opened talks today on forming a mainstream coalition with leftists. The ultra-rightist Republicans, campaigning on a platform of ridding <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> of foreigners, captured 7.5 percent of the vote and 11 seats in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> legislature. It was the first time they gained a place in that body since their party was formed in 1983. However, the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, who suffered heavy losses in Sunday's vote, ruled out a coalition with Republicans. The Republicans' national chairman is <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoenhuber </PERSON>, a 66-year-old former Nazi Waffen SS soldier. Under <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s complicated election laws, the party will also gain two seats in the national parliament after the December 1990 federal elections National party leaders instructed <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> mayor, <PERSON> Eberhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Diepgen </PERSON>, to begin today's coalition talks with his leftist <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> rival <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Momper </PERSON>. Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> lost a natural ally when the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> failed to gain any seats in the legislature. The two parties had governed <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> in a coalition that also controls the federal government. Sunday's voting gave the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> 55 seats each in the 138-seat house, while the far-left Alternative List came away with 17 seats. <PERSON> Momper </PERSON> said he would not govern with the Alternatives as long as they insist on cutting back the number of Allied troops stationed in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. The outcome was overshadowed by the success of the Republicans, who say they have 1,000 card-carrying members in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and more than 7,000 nationwide. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> told a news conference in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> on Monday the outcome was worrisome because of the Republicans' appeal among West Germans, who are increasingly worried by a wave of foreigners competing for jobs, housing and social services. `` There is an urgent need to discuss these problems and come up with better solutions,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said. Mayor <PERSON> Diepgen </PERSON>, calling the elections `` a bitter loss,'' said the obvious surge in ultra-right support poses a serious challenge for the leading political parties in the city and country.

 <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> LeVeque </PERSON>, the last of the original <ORGANIZATION> Keystone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kops </ORGANIZATION>, the troupe of slapstick gendarmes whose comic antics endeared them to a generation of silent film fans, has died at age 92. <PERSON> LeVeque </PERSON>, who was born in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, died Saturday, said his son, <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>.

<DATELINE>ELIZABETHTOWN, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A judge has released an Amish man jailed for contempt for refusing to turn over his 6-year-old son for cancer treatments despite warnings the child will die without medical help. <PERSON> Hardin </PERSON> District Judge <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, who had found <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Mast </PERSON> in contempt of court Friday, ordered his release Monday after concluding jailing the father would not help the child, <PERSON> Amos </PERSON>. In a brief statement, <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said: `` I have done my best to convey to Mr. <PERSON> Mast </PERSON> the seriousness of his legal position in the hope that he might relent and not allow this child to die untreated. He has not done so.'' But the judge overruled a motion to have all previous orders in the case canceled _ meaning <PERSON> Mast </PERSON> was still held in contempt of court. <PERSON> Amos </PERSON> was diagnosed with cancer in October and was under the care of <LOCATION> Kosair </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Children </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>. In December, a hearing was held after the child's physician contacted the <LOCATION> Hardin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> attorney about the case. At a second hearing in early January, hospital officials said the child had not resumed chemotherapy. Without the treatment, the boy is expected to live only a few months, said Assistant County Attorney <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>. `` There's really no doubt in my mind that, barring a miracle, this boy is going to die,'' <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> said. `` You keep hoping they're going to listen to reason. Relatives and family members said the child is not in the community and may have been taken to another state. <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mast </PERSON>'s father-in-law, said last week that he believes his grandson is being helped by a `` natural'' treatment of herbs and vitamins. Mast is a member of an Amish community of 15 families living in <LOCATION> Sonora </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Hardin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Their religion teaches separation from the world and stresses simplicity as a way of life.

<HEAD>Government Report Vindicates Chun, Opposition Cries Foul</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A long-awaited government report today vindicated former President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON> of corruption and power abuses during his seven-year rule. The three main opposition parties accused the government of covering up the wrongdoings of <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, who is a friend of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON> and former classmate at military college. Opposition leaders said they will work to seek the appointment of a special prosecutor to thoroughly investigate alleged wrongdoing by <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, his family and associates. In a report ending nearly a year of investigation, the prosecution said 47 people have been arrested, including 13 members of <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s family, a former government intelligence chief, two former <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> ministers, a ruling party lawmaker and a former <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> mayor. Senior prosecutor Park Chong-chul announced the report's findings and said 20 other people have been booked for indictment but not detained. Trial dates have not been set. Those arrested and indicted are charged with embezzlement and abuse of authority for personal gain. But none was accused of raising illegal political funds for <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> _ a main complaint voiced by the opposition. Prosecutor-General <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ki-choon </PERSON> said the investigation was conducted in a `` neutral and independent manner,'' but opposition parties said the results fall far short of public expectations. Rep. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Sang-soo </PERSON>, spokesman for the largest opposition <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, charged the prosecution took its cue from <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON> and did not look into <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s alleged wrongdoings. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, 58, left office last February. He has denied any personal corruption, but surrendered $ 24 million in illegal political funds before going into rural exile. Radical students and dissidents have demonstrated frequently in recent months, demanding <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> be punished for alleged corruption and human rights violations.

 <LOCATION> ISLAMABAD </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> _ Four long-range <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> missiles slammed into villages today near the main Soviet withdrawal route and killed 70 people, Moslem guerrillas said. Western diplomats said an upsurge in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> and government attacks during the past week appeared to be aimed at pressuring the guerrillas to reach a political settlement with the Soviet-backed government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. The diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> is expected to be out of the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> area by Feb. 6. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> pledged in a U.N.-brokered accord last year to remove all of its more than 100,000 combat troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by Feb. 15. Although the final phase of the pullout is in full swing in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, the diplomats did not predict when the Soviets would leave other parts of the country, notably <LOCATION> Shindand </LOCATION> air base in western <LOCATION> Farah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Jamiat-i-Islami </ORGANIZATION>, one of the major Afghan guerrilla factions, said it received news of today's missile attack in a radio report from its commander, <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Masood </PERSON>. The guerrillas said the SS-1 Scud missiles hit in the <LOCATION> Khinja </LOCATION> section of the <LOCATION> Panjshir </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> about 30 miles northeast of the Salang Highway. There was no independent confirmation of the missile attacks. Official Afghan media have accused <PERSON> Masood </PERSON> of attacking convoys carrying food to the capital. However, the Jamiat faction said the convoys also were loaded with arms and ammunition for the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> regime. Combined Soviet and Afghan government forces have leveled villages and killed hundreds of people since Jan. 23 in coordinated high-altitude bombing attacks, artillery barrages, missile launches and ground assaults, according to Western and guerrilla sources. Most of the attacks were targeted along the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s main pullout route between <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and the Soviet border, they said. But they said villages up to 30 miles away from the road also suffered. Also today, the 11 remaining members of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> staff in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> left the country a day after closing their mission because of concerns about fighting in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> after the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> leaves. The embassy staff flew out of the Afghan capital aboard a chartered plane to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, and they are expected to go to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> later this week. Although the embassy was closed Monday, the Americans could not immediately depart because <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> airport was shut by a three-inch snowfall. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> accused the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> of pursuing what it called a `` scorched earth'' policy as its troops withdraw. By contrast, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said, U.S.-armed Afghan insurgents were showing restraint toward the departing <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. `` The Soviets continue what might even be called a scorched earth policy, as they continue very, very intensive air activity,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. `` We just do n't believe that this kind of a policy is what is called for at the time when <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> ought to be looking to the future.'' One Western diplomat in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> said `` the Soviet bombing and missile attacks can not be explained by a putative Soviet desire to protect its retreating troops.'' He said the guerrillas `` have not been attacking the withdrawing Soviet troops on the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> or elsewhere.'' `` The situation for survivors of these attacks is bleak,'' said another diplomat. `` Survivors have been left homeless in the midst of one of the worst winters in recent memory, in most cases without provisions.'' The communists seized power in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> in a 1978 coup, touching off a civil war with Moslem insurgents. Soviet forces intervened in December 1979 to replace one pro-Moscow government with another, then remained to fight the guerrillas.

 Consumer groups are supporting a European ban of hormone-treated beef from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and say consumers here also should demand the right to buy meat certified as chemical-free. The Consumer Federation of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and other consumer advocates are also urging President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to reverse the administration's refusal to let <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and other states export hormone-free beef while <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> spar over the safety of growth hormones The consumer advocates want <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to negotiate a 90-day cooling-off period with the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> to keep the dispute from escalating into a trade war. `` If the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> proceed in the direction that they're going we very well could have a real trade war in which consumers on both sides of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> are really going to be the ones who get hurt,'' <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nutrition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> has said it will slap tough tariffs on American walnuts and dried fruit if no progress is made by Feb. 20 to end the dispute over hormones used by domestic producers to fatten cattle more quickly. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> on Jan. 1 banned imports of beef treated with hormones, contending they are a health threat. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> disputes those claims and retaliated against the loss of about $ 100 million in annual beef sales by setting $ 100 million in higher tariffs on a variety of Common Market goods. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Agriculture Commissioner <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hightower </PERSON> has been working with the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> to certify hormone-free beef from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and find buyers for the Lone Star exports. But the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative's office last week said such a deal would not be allowed because the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> has no way to certify beef is hormone-free. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said he believes <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> `` can do a certification procedure if it wants to'' and questioned the administration's decision to bar such exports as farmers, inching toward recovery after their worst recession in decades, have an opportunity to find new markets. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said a 90-day cooling off period would give <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> time to develop a hormone-free beef certification procedure. The Consumer Federation of American said the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s ban is `` an issue of consumer protection and not trade protection.'' `` Serious questions have been raised about the necessity and safety of hormone additives in meat. Through the ban, consumers in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> have expressed their preference for hormone-free beef. They have opted to be safe, rather than sorry, and we believe that preference must be respected,'' said <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Eskin </PERSON> of the CFA, which represents more than 240 state, local and national organizations. She said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consumers should push their preference for hormone-free beef and urge the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> to develop a procedure that certifies beef has not been treated with hormones and other drugs or chemicals. <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said prices would increase if producers stopped using growth hormones. The AMI contends the hormone issue is a trade barrier that has `` nothing to do with safety,'' <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said. `` <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> wants to be a net exporter, not a net importer.''

 A man accused of marrying at least four women has pleaded guilty to defrauding two women lured to the altar by his promises to share an inheritance with them. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON>, 49, married at least four women under false pretenses, lived off their cash and credit, and then deserted them, federal authorities said.

<HEAD>Authorities Break Up Mafia-Terrorist Arms and Drugs Ring</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALERMO, Sicily (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Authorities have broken an international ring of Sicilian Mafia and right-wing terrorists who trafficked in drugs and weapons, newspapers reported today. Arrest warrants for 72 suspects wanted for criminal association, arms and drug trafficking have been issued in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and abroad, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, the reports said quoting authorities at a Monday news conference. Names of suspects living outside <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> were not immediately disclosed. Authorities said they arrested at least 48 people Monday for involvement in the ring, whose plots included plans to sell French warplanes to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> nation of <LOCATION> Guinea-Bissau </LOCATION>. The investigation extends to <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stampa </ORGANIZATION> said. Warrants were issued by Judge <PERSON> Alba </PERSON> <PERSON> Dova </PERSON> of the Tuscan coastal city of <PERSON> Massa </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrara </PERSON>, where the investigation was coordinated for more than a year. <PERSON> Dova </PERSON> said the link between the Mafia and right-wing extremists `` leads one to think of the existence of an international extremist right-wing political organization that finances itself through illegal financial operations and ties with organized crime.'' Much of the illegal trafficking was arranged through two Italian import-export firms called <LOCATION> Eurogross </LOCATION> and Fininvest 2000, authorities said. The ring's activities included deals in stolen art, cars and foreign currency, with some money recycled through coded Swiss bank accounts, they said. A key figure named in the warrants is <PERSON> Marco </PERSON> <PERSON> Affatigato </PERSON>, a reputed leader of New Order, an extreme rightist group accused of a string of terrorist attacks in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> in the 1970s and early 1980s. Affatigato is believed to be in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Among Mafia suspects rounded up in raids were members of the <PERSON> Corleone </PERSON> family, considered <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION>'s most powerful Mafia clan, and of the Minore family from <PERSON> Trapani </PERSON>, a Sicilian port linked to clandestine drug and arms shipments. The man considered the <PERSON> Corleone </PERSON> family's `` cashier,'' <PERSON> Michele </PERSON> <PERSON> Cillari </PERSON>, was among more noted figures arrested on Monday. The judge said the investigation stemmed from the 1987 discovery of arms and drugs aboard a Lebanese ship off <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Adriatic </LOCATION> coast. The ship set out from <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and was loaded with heroin, hashish, an anti-tank bazooka, a Soviet grenade-launcher and other arms. Initially, it was linked to alleged arms smuggling between <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, including clandestine delivery of mines to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Several Italian industrialists and arms manufacturers were arrested but later released and charges dropped. On Monday, official said documents seized in connection with the ship led them to the ring. Evidence included false certificates of a dummy bank called the `` Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>'' of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. The gang allegedly plotted to deliver French Mirage jetfighters to <LOCATION> Guinea-Bissau </LOCATION>, acting as middlemen in return for kickbacks, authorities said. The scheme allegedly involved an Italian representative of the African country and an official of the French aircraft company <ORGANIZATION> Dassault-Breguet </ORGANIZATION>. It was not known if the planes were delivered.

 <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cadiz </LOCATION>, who died after skiing into a cable at the World Alpine Ski Championships, was remembered as someone who liked to `` ski fast and drive fast.'' <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Borbon </PERSON> <PERSON> y </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Dampierre </PERSON>, a 52-year-old first cousin of King <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> and member of the international governing body of ski racing, had been skiing Monday with companions when he collided with the cable, which was being raised to support a banner at the finish line of a course at Beaver Creek Resort, officials said. No official cause of death has been determined, but he suffered severe neck lacerations, said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Beavers </PERSON> of the Eagle County Sheriff's Department. King <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> and Queen <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> expressed their sorrow over his death. The victim's brother, <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Borbon </PERSON>, said he would fly from <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> today to bring his body back to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> for burial. The accident occurred Monday afternoon as the slalom course was being converted for downhill competition. Members of the ski patrol and emergency personnel attended to the duke at the scene, but he was pronounced dead on arrival at <ORGANIZATION> Vail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Beavers </ORGANIZATION> said. Beavers said authorities were continuing to interview witnesses. All Monday night events were canceled by World Championship officials, who ordered flags flown at half-staff and made plans for a memorial service. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Borbon </PERSON>, who was not in the line of succession to the <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> throne, had served as <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> from 1969 to 1973. An avid skier, he was president of the Spanish Skiing Federation from 1977 to 1984 and president of the Spanish Olympic Committee from 1984 to 1987. He was a member of the Council of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ski </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is a very sad occasion,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Knous </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> Vail-Beaver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> World Championship Organizing Committee. `` This was something none of us ever hoped to see anywhere, especially at an event of this magnitude.'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Borbon </PERSON>'s father was the elder brother of King <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON>' father Both men's fathers were the sons of King <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON> <PERSON> XIII </PERSON>, who abdicated the Spanish throne in 1931. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Borbon </PERSON> was a descendant of <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> XIV </PERSON>, the French <PERSON> Sun </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, and was the Bourbon or `` legitimist'' candidate for king had the monarchy ever been restored in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. In 1972, he married <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> Franco </PERSON>, granddaughter of the late Spanish dictator <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Franco </PERSON>, but they divorced in 1982. In February 1984, he again made headlines following an auto accident in which the older of his two sons was killed on the way home from a skiing trip in the Spanish Basque country. A judge ruled that <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Borbon </PERSON>, who was driving, had been negligent and stripped him of the custody of his other son. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez-Ochoa </PERSON>, the slalom gold medalist at the 1972 Olympics and a close friend of the duke, said <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Borbon </PERSON> liked to `` ski fast and drive fast.'' Referring to the duke's divorce, the fatal auto accident and the skiing tragedy, <PERSON> Fernandez-Ochoa </PERSON> described the victim as `` an unlucky person. Bad things happened to him.'' It was the second tragedy involving a ski official during a major event in the past year. In the 1988 Winter Olympics at <LOCATION> Calgary </LOCATION>, Dr. <PERSON> Joerg </PERSON> <PERSON> Oberhammer </PERSON>, a prominent Austrian surgeon affiliated with that country's ski team, was killed when he was knocked into the path of a snow-grooming machine.

 The evacuation flight carrying the last 11 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> staffers out of the besieged Afghan capital narrowly missed a head-on collision with a Soviet transport plane today, the two most senior American diplomats said. `` We had a near-collision 10 minutes after take-off with an incoming flight from the north,'' <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Glassman </PERSON>, charge d'affaires at the closed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> said after arriving in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumaker </PERSON>, the second-ranking diplomat at the embassy, said the Americans' chartered <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight came within a mile of a head-on collision with the Soviet IL-76 transport plane. `` Air traffic control at <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> is never very good,'' <PERSON> Schumaker </PERSON> said. Both diplomats praised the captain of the <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 for his quick and expert action in avoiding a collision. `` We drank a champagne toast after crossing the Afghan border,'' <PERSON> Schumaker </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> ordered the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>'s two diplomats, four Marine guards and five-member support staff to leave <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> because of fears the Afghan army could not protect foreign diplomats after the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> withdraws. The Americans are expected to return to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> this week. Soviet soldiers entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s civil war nine years ago and are to be gone by Feb. 15 under a U.N.-mediated agreement. Moslem insurgents, who get most of their support from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, were not parties to the agreement and predict victory soon after the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> departs. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> closed after an emotional ceremony during which the American flag was lowered.

 A man named Noid, apparently annoyed by <PERSON> Domino </PERSON>'s Pizza's `` Avoid the Noid'' ads, held two Domino's employees at gunpoint for more than five hours before they escaped and he surrendered, authorities said. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Noid </PERSON>, 22, told police he thinks <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Monaghan </PERSON>, owner of the Detroit-based pizza chain and the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> baseball club, `` comes in his apartment and looks around,'' said Police Chief <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. Investigators believe <PERSON> Noid </PERSON> was `` having an ongoing feud in his mind with <PERSON> Monaghan </PERSON> about the ` Noid' commercials,'' said detective Sgt. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Bender </PERSON>. `` Apparently, he thinks they're aimed at him.'' Domino's national TV advertising campaign features the `` Noid,'' a red-hatted, red-caped gremlin who uses every trick he can to make sure the pizza is not delivered hot and fresh but is never successful. Police said <PERSON> Noid </PERSON> entered the suburban <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> store shortly before 11 a.m. Monday and made one of the employees call police to tell them he had taken hostages and to stay clear of the area. When police arrived, Noid fired four warning shots into the ceiling of the store, Capt. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> said. Police did not return fire. `` He said he did n't want to kill them, but if the police came in he would shoot them,'' <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> said. Noid demanded $ 100,000, a get-away car, and a science fiction book titled `` The Widow's Son.'' He also ordered and ate a pizza. One hostage fled the store after 5 -LCB- hours and the second escaped about 15 minutes later while <PERSON> Noid </PERSON>'s back was turned, authorities said. Noid gave up minutes later and was charged with two counts of kidnapping, two counts of aggravated assault and theft by extortion for demanding the $ 100,000 from Domino's, <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> said. He was held today on $ 250,000 bond.

 The governor ordered <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> troops to help with patient care today at a state hospital, where unionized employees have staged a sickout since Saturday. Most of the workers later showed up.

About 80 employees eventually showed up at the state <LOCATION> General </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> this morning, out of 106 scheduled to work, <PERSON> Caley </PERSON> said. `` Things seemed to have cooled off a little,'' said <PERSON> Fran </PERSON> <PERSON> Segerson </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the governor. `` With 80 percent of the employees working, it seems like some of the employees are getting tired of this.'' Talks continued between the hospital and union leaders to end the sickout by attendants and licensed practical nurses, but <PERSON> Caley </PERSON> had no details of the talks.

 A man who `` literally exploded'' was hospitalized today after he detonated a homemade bomb when a police officer questioned him about a domestic argument, authorities said. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, 49, was in critical condition at <ORGANIZATION> Comanche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, a hospital official said. Policeman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Schucker </PERSON>, 24, was treated and released after suffering minor cuts from the explosion Monday night, hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Brack </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Schucker </PERSON> responded to a report of domestic disturbance and stopped a vehicle reportedly involved, police Maj. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. `` After stopping that vehicle, during a routine conversation with the driver, the driver literally exploded,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. The man told <PERSON> Schucker </PERSON> that he had an explosive device and set the device to go off in a few seconds, police Capt. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON> said. The man apparently was upset because his estranged wife had obtained a protective order. Shotgun shells, screws, a pager, down from the lining of a jacket and wires were scattered by the explosion, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 A court today acquitted a man who spent 30 years on death row for the kidnap and murder of a 6-year-old girl. It was <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s fourth case in six years in which a death row inmate was acquitted of murder in a retrial. In all four cases, judges said confessions, which defendants made during interrogation but later recanted, lacked credibility. After today's verdict, the court freed <PERSON> Masao </PERSON> <PERSON> Akabori </PERSON>, 59, who had been sentenced to death by a district court in 1958. The sentence was upheld by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1960, but a retrial began in 1987 in the <ORGANIZATION> Shizuoka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> after four appeals by <PERSON> Akabori </PERSON>. `` I am glad I won the appeal because I am innocent. And I am so thankful to my lawyers and all the people who have supported me and encouraged me through the past 35 years,'' <PERSON> Akabori </PERSON> said in a statement. His lawyers said he managed to avoid hanging because of an active support group. Such a long stretch on death row is rare but not unprecedented in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Akabori </PERSON> was arrested two months after 6-year-old <PERSON> Hisako </PERSON> <PERSON> Sano </PERSON> was kidnapped and strangled March 10, 1954, near her home in <LOCATION> Shimada </LOCATION> about 125 miles west of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. Under police questioning, he confessed to the crime, but he later withdrew the confession and pleaded innocent. Today's verdict by a three-judge panel said <PERSON> Akabori </PERSON>'s confession lacked credibility, and there was no other credible evidence linking him to the crime. <PERSON> Akabori </PERSON>'s lawyers said he is entitled to $ 930,200 in government compensation for his wrongful time behind bars.

 Fliers from the aircraft carrier USS <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> returned home today feeling relieved and proud after a six-month voyage that included the shooting down of two Libyan jets over the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. `` The way the crew reacted was in a very professional manner and that's what we're all about. We did as we were trained to do,'' said Capt. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Norris </PERSON>, commander of Airwing 3 aboard the Kennedy. Two F-14 Tomcat jet fighters from the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> shot down two <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> jets that approached them in a hostile manner on Jan. 4. While planes from the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> returned today, the carrier and its battle group will return to their homeports Wednesday.

A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said he doubted the fliers would feel left out. `` Mostly they're going to be concerned about their families,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Campaign Begins in Bid to Make Poor Working Families Aware of Benefit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Millions of the nation's poorest working families are missing out on a federal check of up to $ 874 a year, and dozens of labor, church and business groups began a campaign today to let them know about it. Working families with children and incomes of up to $ 18,576 may qualify for a portion of the earned-income tax credit. If they qualify, their tax bills could be wiped out completely _ and they could get a check even if they owe no tax. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a non-profit Washington-based organization that keeps an eye on federal actions affecting low - and middle-income Americans, is coordinating a drive to educate potential recipients of the credit The campaign is being underwritten by organized labor, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, the Conference of Mayors and other groups as diverse as Planned Parenthood and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> Veterans of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` We are concerned that millions of low-income working families with children may miss out on a valuable benefit they have earned,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenstein </PERSON>, director of the center, told reporters. The 1986 tax overhaul expanded the credit, making it available to more families. At the same time, the new law eliminated as many as 6 million poorer people from the tax rolls altogether, meaning they do n't even have to file a federal tax return. However, they must file a return in order to receive the earned-income credit. <PERSON> Greenstein </PERSON> and his coalition are distributing fliers, radio commercials and other educational material that spells out the credit and how to obtain it. `` We think it is almost a crime if the people who are entitled to these benefits do n't obtain them,'' said <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, executive assistant to the president of the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Daly </PERSON>, director of social policy for the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, said the nation's 189 dioceses will be asked to place inserts in church bulletins and lead community discussions to ensure that poor families are informed of the credit. As many as 11 million families are eligible for the credit, which was enacted in 1975 to provide a bonus that was aimed at keeping them off the welfare rolls. The benefit was designed essentially to offset a significant part of the Social Security taxes paid by the poorest workers. The credit begins declining after family earnings exceed $ 9,840; it disappears once income hits $ 18,576. The credit cancels out up to $ 874 of a family's tax bill. If the family owes no tax, the credit is `` refundable'' _ that is, it can exceed tax liability. Thus, if a family owes no tax, the government will mail a check for up to $ 874. <PERSON> Greenstein </PERSON> pointed out that workers who qualify for the credit may be able to get it in advance in their paychecks through the year. Too, those who qualified for the credit in the past but did not file for it may be able to collect retroactive payments for the past three years.

<TEXT>
 A conservative activist told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> today that he encountered Defense Secretary-designate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> in an inebriated condition on several occasions accompanied by women other than his wife. The witness, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, has opposed Tower's nomination on grounds he is soft on Star Wars. Today <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON> questioned whether Tower had the moral character to oversee the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> reforms that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has promised he would initiate. `` I have made enough personal observations of this man here in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to have serious reservations about his moral character,'' <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON> claimed that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s transition team received hundreds of letters criticizing Tower, some containing specific allegations of `` moral impropriety'' against the nominee, but did not bring the letters to the president's attention. <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON> said he never saw the letters, but `` I have encountered the senator in a condition lacking sobriety as well as with women he was not married to.''. `` The encounters occurred frequently enough to make an impression. I did encounter this on a number of occasions,'' he said. Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the panel, immediately suggested that discussions of any information <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON> had on the nominee's personal life be taken up in a closed session scheduled this afternoon Tower was to testify in that session. Tower was dogged by allegations of drinking and womanizing before his nomination was announced by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. In divorce papers filed by his second wife, <PERSON> Lila </PERSON> <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Cummings </PERSON>, Tower was accused of `` marital misconduct.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has defended Tower, saying an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> background check found nothing that would prevent him from serving as defense secretary. Tower, a 63-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION>, served 24 years in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, including a brief tenure as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> from 1981-84. `` He considers SDI -LRB- Strategic Defense Initiative -RRB- a bargaining chip. We do n't,'' <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON> has said previously. `` He's not in favor of military reform. We think military reform is necessary particularly in this year of budget crunch.'' Tower told the committee last week he does not `` believe that we can devise an umbrella that can protect the entire <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> population from nuclear incineration. I think that's unrealistic.'' Tower said a more limited system might work but cautioned that `` it remains to be seen whether that is a realistic objective.'' In his two days of testimony, <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> also pledged to remain objective in <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> decision-making despite receiving more than $ 1 million in consulting fees from defense contractors. But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, a senior fellow and associate professor at the <ORGANIZATION> Fulbright </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION>, questioned Tower's pledge. `` Mr. <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> is the wrong man for this job at this time,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Monday. `` I plan to focus on how he symbolizes the revolving door syndrome in the defense culture as he called it.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, onetime foreign policy adviser to former Secretary of State <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Muskie </PERSON>, said Tower showed little interest in defense reform when the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator served as chairman of the Armed Services panel. `` He's a bad choice when we need someone whose track record is sound,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday he is unsure whether Tower will implement the reform recommendations of the <ORGANIZATION> Packard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the presidential panel that called for strengthening the authority of the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>. `` I'm not sure he knows what's involved, what kind of buzzsaw he'll run into,'' said <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, who heads a non-profit, non-partisan organization that includes small defense subcontractors, also criticized Tower's record on foreign sourcing for contracts `` I do n't know what his position is,'' <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said. `` When he was on the committee he did n't do anything to help our industries, then when he left he worked for British Aerospace -LRB- as a consultant -RRB-. A lot of our people have gone out of business.''

 In an attempt to end <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s economic crisis, President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> has announced plans to cut the budget by nearly half, lay off 35,000 troops and public employees and end subsidies for basic goods He said in announcing the austerity plan on Monday that city dwellers would be hardest hit and suggested many move back to the farm. Speaking to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> called for the cooperation of private business and told landholders the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government would no longer confiscate private property. However, opposition leaders said they are puzzled by the plan and wo n't support it. `` <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON>'s speech is rather nebulous,'' said <PERSON> Ramiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Gurdian </PERSON>, vice president of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coordinate </ORGANIZATION> and president of a farm owners' organization. He said there was no agreeement with private businessmen to back the plan. Opposition leader <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolanos </PERSON> said he understood the speech to mean the government wants to control everything, including producers' profits, while producers take all the risks. `` It does n't make much sense,'' he said. In ending the two-hour, 40-minute address, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> told his fellow 3.5 million Nicaraguans that sacrifice is needed to bring the economy out of crisis and curb inflation, which reached 20,000 percent last year. `` I appeal to the sensibility and honesty of all Nicaraguans so this proposal does n't turn into a political confrontation,'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said. `` Otherwise, we'll be paying with the blood and the future of our people.'' He said the federal budget this year would be cut by 44 percent _ 461 billion cordobas or about $ 100 million to $ 200 million. The president said the government would impose a `` war economy'' policy if inflation is not brought under control. He did not elaborate. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said the government will reduce subsidies for basic goods, but did not provide details. He did not say during the speech how many workers the government plans to lay off. But in a telephone interview with the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nacional </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, he put the figure at 35,000, including 23,000 from the army and <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and 12,000 from other public institutions. The Sandinista army had 74,000 troops last year, including reservists and militia. Laid-off workers will receive temporary compensation and be offered agricultural employment, he said, noting that about 10,000 workers are needed for the coffee harvest. He suggested, in addition, that laborers who live in cities consider moving to rural areas to find employment. Thousands of Nicaraguans migrated to <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, the capital, and other cities to flee the fighting during the 7-year war with the U.S.-backed Contra rebels in which a preliminary cease-fire was reached last March. Thousands more flooded into cities after Hurricane <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> ravaged the country in October. The storm killed more than 100 people, left at least 200,000 people homeless and caused more than $ 800 million in economic damage, according too the government. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> has described storm damages to crops as immeasurable, and annual Soviet bloc assistance of $ 500 million has failed to right the battered economy. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> once exported rice and beans, but now imports those staples; shortages have pushed food prices skyward. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said the budget cuts will require deep slashes in capital investment and government credits to agriculture and business. State-run banks, he said, will provide new loans `` only to those who can pay,'' but he said the government would continue `` stimulating private producers, regardless of their political positions.'' In another gesture to the private sector, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> declared that government confiscations of private property were a thing of the past. About 85 percent of farmland in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> is in private hands, and just 15 percent is owned by the state, he said. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> also announced that the official and parallel rates of currency exchange will be merged to eliminate black market demand for dollars. He did not say what the rate would be. The official rate, 2,300 cordobas per dollar, is used to calculate payment for exports, and the parallel rate, at 4,400 cordobas, is used for those selling dollars. The dollar now fetches about 5,500 cordobas on the black market. The president blamed <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s runaway inflation on spending associated with the Contra war, which by government count claimed 26,500 lives. A <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> trade embargo imposed against <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in 1985 also reduced government revenues, he said.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney for <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> resigned following months of allegations that he politicized his office and lied about seeing his predecessor smoke marijuana. `` The work of this office is far too important to be sidetracked by any controversy,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said in announcing his resignation Monday. In his brief statement, <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> did not mention a continuing <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> investigation into his conduct that staff members said had hindered the office's activities. He said he intended to return to private practice. <PERSON> Jeremiah </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Sullivan </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organized </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strike </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, was named the interim head of the office and was sworn in this morning before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Judge <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>, a 41-year-old Republican, has been the target of a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> investigation since November, when investigators found no evidence to support allegations that he saw <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> smoke marijuana. During the probe, <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> admitted to smoking marijuana himself. On Friday, 28 of the 39 assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys working for <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> wrote to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, urging him to expedite <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>'s departure. `` Mr. <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>'s conduct and performance while <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> attorney is resulting in a loss of confidence in the adminstration of justice,'' the letter said. `` The credibility and operations of this office will continue to be damaged ... unless he is removed.'' Prosecutors who had been critical of <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> privately expressed relief over his decision to leave. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> nominated <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> to replace <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> in April 1987, when <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> ascended to head the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s criminal division. But <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>'s confirmation was held up while the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigated his failure to pay income tax for several years, and irregularities in his congressional campaign finances after his unsuccessful 1982 race against then-House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> `` Tip'' <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> Jr.. During the confirmation process, <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> said he believed <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> was trying to scuttle his nomination and told investigators that he had seen <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> drunk on a couple of occasions He also alleged he had seen <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> smoke marijuana at a 1982 wedding party. A <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> investigation failed to support <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>'s charges, and <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> admitted that he had smoked marijuana at a later date Last weekend, <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> denied urging a federal investigation into marijuana-smoking charges against <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> II and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Farmer </PERSON>, the top fund-raiser for Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s presidential campaign. <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> said the allegation stemmed from an unsubstantiated <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report that was leaked to reporters. In November, several assistant prosecutors said <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> pursued an investigation of a prison land deal by the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> administration in an attempt to discredit <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, then the Democratic nominee for president. Shortly after <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>'s announcement Monday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> commended him for resigning, saying, `` It was long overdue.''

 The strongest high pressure system in North American history tightened its frigid grip on <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, and that arctic air hit <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> today after high wind blew railroad cars off their tracks and knocked down a grain elevator. Balmy weather that set records for warmth in many cities ended abruptly today in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, where Great Falls dropped to 10 degrees below zero this morning, after a record high of 62 on Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. The temperature at Great Falls dropped 48 degrees within three hours after the cold front of arctic air passed over the city. Nearly two dozen rural <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> schools closed today when strong northerly wind reduced visibility to near zero with blowing snow and dropped wind chill factors to 45 degrees below zero. Authorities advised no travel in the northeastern part of the state. It was 51 degrees below zero Monday morning in <LOCATION> Fairbanks </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, where the temperature has risen above minus 40 only once during the past three weeks. There were unofficial readings of 75 below in some parts of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, the weather service said. The severe cold in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> closed schools, brought state government to a virtual standstill and was tentatively blamed for the crash of a Canadian military transport plane outside <LOCATION> Fairbanks </LOCATION>. High wind that produced extreme wind chill factors also disrupted the flow of oil through the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> pipeline by preventing ships from entering <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> harbor to load up. The cold air is being caused by a dome of extremely high atmospheric pressure over <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. The barometer at <LOCATION> Northway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, rose to a record high of 31.74 inches of mercury, the weather service reported today. Just the day before, <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, reached a high of 31.54 inches, breaking the previous record for <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> of 31.53 inches, recorded in the Yukon Territory of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> in 1974. Although temperatures in much of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> have risen slightly since the weekend, the moderation has been accompanied by rising winds that have disrupted ship traffic and created dangerously low wind-chill readings. The arriving cold front produced snow today over <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and wind chill factors were between 30 and 40 below zero over <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. Before the front arrived, weather service forecasters in <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> said it would be the `` coldest arctic system in five years'' to hit the state. `` This is a very dangerous storm and should not be taken lightly,'' the weather service said in a special statement issued Monday. Meanwhile, wind up to 124 mph hammered <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> on Monday, blowing at least 10 railroad freight cars off their tracks near <LOCATION> Browning </LOCATION>, toppling a grain elevator near Cut Bank and fueling an unusual mid-winter range fire, authorities said. No injuries were reported. The wind was caused by the flow of air between a high pressure system over <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and lower pressure along the arctic cold front, the weather service said. It coincided with a period of record high temperatures in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and across much of the country. High temperature records fell in places as far apart as <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, where it was 62; <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt. </LOCATION>, where it was 45; and Minneapolis-St. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, where it was 48 <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> tied its record for the date of 82. Although <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> is exporting its cold weather, no significant warming is expected there for at least five days, the weather service said. There was, however, some good news for Alaskans on Monday when the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> reopened the Valdez Narrows between the Port of <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> and Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> late Monday after winds abated enough to allow safe tanker operations. Gusts approaching 100 mph had forced the closure of the port for a day, prompting the <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to reduce flow in the trans-Alaska oil pipeline by 65 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said the pipeline should be able to resume normal production of about 2 million barrels a day by late Tuesday. The state treasury had stood to lose $ 3 million a day in lost taxes and royalties if the closure had continued. The temperature crept a few degrees above zero in south-central <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> on Monday, 55 mph gusts blew windows out of a downtown <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> office building. Schools were closed in several places around the state, and the state court system shut down out of concern for the safety for jurors. Gov. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> ordered all non-essential state employees in Fairbanks to stay home until there was a break in the weather. The cold continued to hamper exercises designed to show the military's ability to function in harsh arctic conditions. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> pulled its troops out of Brim Frost'89 after eight men were killed when a transport plane crashed while trying to land at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wainwright </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Fairbanks </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>International Survey Finds US Youth Among Worst in Science, Math</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 American teen-agers came out at the bottom of the heap in a survey of math and science performance among students in five countries and four Canadian provinces, the <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Testing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported today. The low math performance levels are `` a matter for grave concern'' while the science results `` are sobering and pose a serious challenge to our position in the world community,'' according to the report, called `` A World of Differences.'' The <ORGANIZATION> ETS </ORGANIZATION> study is its first international assessment of educational progress, a counterpart to the group's periodic national assessments in various academic fields. It was financed by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>. Findings were based on tests of approximately 24,000 13-year-olds in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>. The last three were divided into <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> - and English-speaking samples In all countries and provinces, the more time spent watching television, the poorer student performance in both math and science, the report found. And in all but two, more than 50 percent of the students reported spending an hour or less each day doing homework in all their subjects. The exceptions were <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, where two hours or more was the norm. The survey revealed that almost all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 13-year-olds have mastered math basics and know everyday science facts. But ETS notes that `` national assessments consistently reveal a weakness in higher-order thinking skills'' and this is borne out in the international assessment. Korean students demonstrated the highest overall mathematics achievement while those from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> -LRB- the French speakers -RRB- showed the lowest. For example, the report said, 78 percent of the Korean 13-year-olds can use intermediate mathematics skills to solve two-step problems, compared with only 40 percent in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and French-speaking <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>. Also in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, 40 percent of the students understand measurement and geometry concepts and can solve even more complex problems _ compared with under 10 percent in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and French-speaking <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>. Despite their poor performance, the <ORGANIZATION> ETS </ORGANIZATION> report said, two-thirds of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> students said they considered themselves `` good at mathematics.'' Only 23 percent of Korean students, the highest achievers, shared that attitude. That only 40 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> students can solve two-step problems `` is a matter for grave concern,'' <ORGANIZATION> ETS </ORGANIZATION> said. Percentages for more complicated tasks `` are even more modest and suggest that the pool of trained talent from which to draw our future scientists, engineers and technicians is small indeed.'' Based on comparisons with more successful participants in the assessment, <ORGANIZATION> ETS </ORGANIZATION> suggests examining the impact of heavy television watching, the small amount of math homework typically done, and the importance attached to math by schools and society in general. On the science front, youths in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> turned in the best performance. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, along with <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and French-speaking <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION>, `` perform well below the mean,'' the report said. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has traditionally thought of itself as technologically innovative and in the forefront in science,'' <ORGANIZATION> ETS </ORGANIZATION> said. `` These results are sobering and pose a serious challenge to our position in the world community.'' More than 70 percent of the youngsters in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> can use scientific procedures and analyze scientific data while only 35 percent to 40 percent of their peers in the bottom four samples showed the same degree of competence, the report said. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> results are `` clearly unacceptable,'' it said. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ambach </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chief </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Officers </ORGANIZATION>, called the <ORGANIZATION> ETS </ORGANIZATION> report `` striking and challenging'' _ particularly its finding that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> students, who did worst in math, think they're good at it. `` Before we feel ` good' about our performance, we had better test it against the competition,'' <PERSON> Ambach </PERSON> said in a statement. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can not be internationally competitive with our 13-year-olds at the bottom in mathematics and near the bottom in science achievement.''

 A judge sentenced a woman to 3 -LCB- to nine years in prison for plotting to murder her estranged husband and using her teen-age son to hire someone to do the job. <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyle-Lawton </PERSON>, a 39-year-old mother of three, pleaded guilty last September to charges of solicitation to commit murder and corruption of minors. <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yohn </PERSON> on Monday ordered her jailed in the state prison at <LOCATION> Muncy </LOCATION>. Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> McNulty </PERSON> presented testimony at the two-day sentencing hearing that Ms. <PERSON> Boyle-Lawton </PERSON> a year ago told her son <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON>, then 17, that she needed his help to kill her husband, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawton </PERSON>, to `` get him out of her hair'' and collect on his $ 300,000 insurance policy. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> found a `` hired killer'' in a classmate at <ORGANIZATION> Wissahickon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Ambler </LOCATION>, who was actually a state trooper posing as a student while investigating drug trafficking at the school, officials said. Trooper <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Fulton </PERSON> testified that he met with Ms. <PERSON> Boyle-Lawton </PERSON> several times to plan the killing and that she gave him money for a gun and silencer. She provided him with a $ 1,000 down payment, pictures of her husband and a written description of him, <PERSON> Fulton </PERSON> said. The trooper secretly wore electronic equipment to record their conversations. Portions of the wiretap were played back in the courtroom, including Ms. <PERSON> Boyle-Lawton </PERSON>'s voice stating amid obscenities, `` I want him dead. I want the insurance.'' Ms. <PERSON> Boyle-Lawton </PERSON> said she had second thoughts about killing her husband and had tried to back out of it. `` I wanted to get out, but he -LRB- <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION> -RRB- was the one who pursued it,'' she said.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Sultan </PERSON> <PERSON> Qaboos </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION> has banned tourists from sea turtle nesting beaches to allow the endangered species to breed in private, a newspaper reported Tuesday. <PERSON> Qaboos </PERSON> decreed that no one is allowed to watch the turtles in the area around <LOCATION> Ras </LOCATION> <LOCATION> al </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hadd </LOCATION>, about 125 miles south of the capital, <LOCATION> Muscat </LOCATION>, according to the <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION> daily, the Observer. Campers have been disturbing the turtles and leaving trash along their nesting beaches, the largest in the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, the sultan said. These beaches are of `` national, regional and worldwide importance for the survival of this species which is threatened with extinction,'' he said. `` To prevent further disturbance of the turtles and damage to the environment, it has been decided that camping and turtle watching by day or night is prohibited,'' the decree said. A government survey conducted from 1977 to 1980 highlighted major nesting and breeding areas of the sea turtles. Omani rangers were trained to take over protection and control activities in 1979 so that the turtle population could be monitored properly.

<HEAD>Soviets Acknowledge 111 Murders in January</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Soviet government, in keeping with a new policy to disclose crime statistics, said Tuesday that 111 murders were committed in the entire country in January, including one policeman killed in the line of duty. Militia Col. <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Arshenevsky </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, was quoted by <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> as saying previously classified crime statistics henceforth `` will be available for everyone.'' The first figures released as part of the new policy showed 93 of the 111 January murders had been solved and that most `` were committed at home due to drunkenness and jealousy,'' the official news agency said. In January 1988, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> reported 152 cases of murder and non-negligent manslaughter. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said 137 holdups were committed in January 1989, only 61 of which were solved. The report added that drivers of unregistered taxis increasingly are being victimized. `` One militia serviceman was killed this month when performing his official duty of maintaining public order, and 12 were injured,'' the report said. It added the militia personnel, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s uniformed police force, used firearms 11 times during the month and that investigation showed each case was justifiable. <PERSON> Arshenevsky </PERSON> said the ministry will begin publishing a statistical bulletin and `` in due course, possibly, all people who wish will be able to subscribe to it.'' Soviet authorities used to provide no information about domestic crime, and the state-controlled media ignored the subject, but under President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of greater openness, the subject often is discussed in the media. Some particularly noteworthy cases, such as airplane hijackings and even the recent firebombing of a private cooperative restaurant in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> are widely reported. Pravda published a report by the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> in January that the crime rate in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had soared by 17 percent during 1988. The report, however, gave no figures for individual crimes.

 An 80-year-old woman faces a possible jail term and hundreds of dollars in fines for six citations accusing her cats of digging up a neighbor's shrubs and using his yard and van as a litter box. The city's <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> issued the citations against <PERSON> Nan </PERSON> <PERSON> Farris </PERSON> over a six-month period because of complaints by her neighbor. Mrs. <PERSON> Farris </PERSON> was ordered into Municipal Court this afternoon to answer the citations. If convicted, she faces $ 943 in fines and an unspecified jail term. `` The whole thing is about the silliest thing I've ever heard of,'' she said. `` This thing is crazy, and I do n't know why it's happening. The city takes a different view. `` Unfortunately, there is a violation involved _ animal at large _ and it is normally our policy to prosecute,'' a spokeswoman for the city attorney told the <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star-Telegram </ORGANIZATION>. The neighbor, <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Neal </PERSON>, said he lived in a neighborhood overrun by cats and did n't see any humor in the situation. `` All I want is for my property to be left alone,'' he said last summer. `` I have a right to plant shrubs without getting my hands in cat stuff.'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Farris </PERSON>' attorney, wrote to the city attorney's office seeking dismissal of the citations. `` I would appreciate it if the great city of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> could find in its heart to show mercy and dismiss these tickets, as I do n't believe a conviction in this case would serve as a deterrent to other cats with a compulsion to violate the law,'' <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON> wrote.

 Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, flanked by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, today announced formation of special task forces to target `` crime in the suites,'' primarily securities and commodities fraud. The Securities and Commodities Fraud Task Forces, including 15 additional assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys, will be located in six cities: <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> already have undertaken substantial investigations of the markets in those two cities. `` We are undertaking to bring this additional firepower to bear on behalf of investors who might otherwise run the risk of being defrauded or lose confidence in the market,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. He said the task forces were being formed to `` combat what can aptly be called crime in the suites.'' Fraud is being committed `` under the guise of respectability in the financial and securities markets,'' he said. In addition, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> loses more than $ 90 billion a year as a result of tax fraud, and white-collar crime has been a factor in many recent business failures, including many of the bank and savings and loan closings. There was no immediate word on how much the new effort will cost. Those involved in the task forces will be senior, experienced prosecutors who will be replaced in their current jobs by new attorneys, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> S.G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, assistant attorney general in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s criminal division, said at a news conference. The task forces will concentrate on the most complex and difficult frauds, including stock loan frauds, precious metals fraud, `` parking'' of securities with buyers concealing how much of a stake they have in a company's stock, and major bank and brokerage frauds, plus tax evasion, obstruction of justice and perjury, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. `` These investigations are difficult and require the sophisticated efforts of experienced prosecutors,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. `` They are not made by breaking down the door and seizing the evidence.'' Agents from the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> also will be involved in the probes. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, who is leaving his post today after five years, made a name for himself in part by attacking insider trading on Wall Street and has long called for additional money to uncover fraud in the securities markets. <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> supervised a two-year undercover investigation of the ntion's largest commodity markets, resulting in allegations that as many as 100 brokers and traders systematically cheated customers and profited themselves in illegal trades. Under the new task forces, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> will get six additional assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys, while the offices in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> will get three each, and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> will get one apiece. An unspecified number of investigators, paralegal workers and other support personnel will be added to those offices as well. In addition to <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> was joined at the news conference by <PERSON> Benito </PERSON> <PERSON> Romano </PERSON>, who becomes interim <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney for <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> on Wednesday after <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> steps down, and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ulrich </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and chairman of the attorney general's <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said today he will insist on tighter controls and higher quality from military contractors in a drive to `` wring the last drop of waste and mismanagement out of the way we buy our weapons.'' He said those steps are vital to building a national consensus in support of a strong defense. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, on first trip out of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as president, made his remarks in a speech on the deck of the aircraft carrier <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> at the huge <ORGANIZATION> Norfolk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> to an audience of thousands of <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> personnel and contractor employees. Standing coatless in temperatures in the 50s, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> coughed frequently and spoke in a raspy voice, evidence of a cold that has plagued him for nearly a week. `` Excuse the cough here,'' he said. After the speech, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had lunch on the ship with enlisted men. He said he was feeling better but that his throat was bothering him so much he thought he might not be able to make it through his speech and had been `` just croaking away'' during it. Touching on cost overruns and the current criminal investigation into <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> purchasing practices, the president said: `` Even if overruns are not new, they are still wrong _ and hurt the national security, particularly when budgets are tight. We want tighter controls and higher standards in weapons procurement.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who was a carrier-based <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> pilot in World War II, said the `` first bulwark of our national defense is our national will. If our will is ruptured, our ship of state can not sail _ or at least sail safely. `` I firmly believe that the vital first step to broadening our national consensus on defense is to wring the last drop of waste and mismanagement out of the way we buy our weapons,'' he said. `` And that's what we intend to do.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is pursuing a 2-year-old investigation of alleged purchasing fraud. The case focuses on charges that private consultants, hired by military contractors, bribed <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials to obtain inside information that gave companies an edge in bidding for Pentagon work. The probe so far has led to guilty pleas by several individuals and one defense-contracting firm the indictment of another contractor. Some 5,500 crew members stood at parade rest on the flight deck of the 1,048-foot-long carrier as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke. Several hundred civilian contractor employees and some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> also were were in the crowd. Taking note of the setting, the president said: `` You know, as an old carrier pilot, today is a very special day for me. I ca n't help thinking of the carrier I once sailed on, the USS San Jacinto.'' He said World War II-vintage carriers were much smaller, `` had narrow decks, smaller planes, no electronics.'' The president used the occasion to emphasize his program to highlight public service, praising members of the military for the sacrifices they make. `` In the years ahead I want to make sure that those who build our ships, planes and weapons live up to the standards of service, dedication and duty that this crew and this shipyard set,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> predicted that one day peace and freedom will triumph worldwide. `` And on that day, who were the heroes, generations to come will ask. Who drove the chariots of fire across the sky? Who brought that day to the earth. And the answer will be you.'' The president pledged to be not only commander-in-chief but a friend to the military. `` And together we will work to spin the gossamer thread of human dreams into a sturdy fabric of peace that will last for generations to come,'' he said.

 Amnesty International today told the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has killed about 60 Palestinians in the occupied territories by misusing tear gas. A <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, meanwhile, told the 43-nation commission that Palestinian children were being killed in `` Israeli gas chambers.'' <PERSON> Nabil </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramlawi </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> representative, said the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> practices were `` reaching war crime proportions.'' `` It's all a great lie,'' said <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON>, spokesman for Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ramlawi </PERSON> charged that pregnant <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> women were beaten, causing them to miscarry, and that organs were stolen from dead Palestinians to be used in transplant operations in Israeli hospitals. A text of <PERSON> Ramlawi </PERSON>'s speech was not available, but an unofficial summary paraphrasing his speech said his comments on `` Israeli gas chambers'' seemed to refer to the use of tear gas. The 13-month Palestinian revolt in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> has claimed the lives of 370 Palestinians and 15 Israelis. The Palestinians are protesting occupation by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, which seized the lands from neighboring Arab states in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. Amnesty's statement said it was gravely concerned because <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities `` appear so far to have condoned if not encouraged the excessive use of force, knowing that it would result in the death or injury of thousands of people.'' Amnesty said about 300 civilians have been shot and killed by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers during the uprising, and that thousands of other people were shot and injured, many critically. `` Deaths in the occupied territories have also been caused by the apparently deliberate misuse of tear gas, fired for example into hospitals and homes,'' Amnesty said. `` This has happened despite explicit instructions from the manufacturer not to use tear gas in confined spaces as it is potentially lethal.'' It said about 60 people were reported to have died in `` tear-gas related incidents, some of them as a direct result of its misuse.'' <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> denied all the allegations. `` It's all nonsense,'' he said. `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> does all it can to cause the minimum damage to property and, of course, with respect to human life. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has certainly not shot into hospitals.'' Amnesty said only three <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers were reported to have been convicted following fatal shootings, with the longest sentence being 18 months in jail for manslaughter. Amnesty said a few other soldiers drew lesser terms for punitive beatings. `` No prosecutions in cases of apparently deliberate misuse of tear gas resulting in deaths are known to have been initiated,'' it said.

 Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> arrives Wednesday to put the final touches on preparations for the first Sino-Soviet summit since the two communist giants split in bitter rivalry 30 years ago. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s visit comes after a year of rapid progress in bilateral relations expected to culminate this spring when <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> becomes the first Soviet leader to travel to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> since 1959. During his three-day stay, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> is to hold two rounds of talks with his Chinese counterpart, <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> <PERSON> Qichen </PERSON>, and will meet with Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>. He is also to travel to <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> for a meeting Saturday with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s top leader, <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> is not scheduled to meet <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> head <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> European sources said. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> apparently wants to wait for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> before officially recognizing a restoration of relations between the two parties. <PERSON> Qian </PERSON>, who in December became the first Chinese foreign minister to hold talks in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in 32 years, told Australian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Gareth </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> on Monday that the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> conflict would be high on the agenda. Soviet support for <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s invasion of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> has been the last and hardest sticking point in Sino-Soviet discussions on normalizing political ties. But <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, apparently satisfied that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> wants <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to end its war against the Chinese-backed resistance in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, accedes that conditions for a summit have been met. The Gorbachev visit, which could come as early as the second half of March, would be the first since <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> met his ideological foe <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in 1959. <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>, already feuding with <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> over the leadership and direction of world communism, at that meeting rescinded an offer to provide <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> a prototype atomic bomb. The next year, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> withdrew more than 1,000 technicians and ended all assistance for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s industrial and military development. Relations reached a nadir in 1969 when troops along the border clashed and <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> called on the nation to prepare for all-out war. Political normalization talks started in 1982, but made little headway because of what <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> calls the `` three obstacles'': <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> intervention in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and Soviet military presence along the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> border. But 1988 proved `` particularly auspicious'' for Sino-Soviet relations, the authoritative weekly <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> said in its latest edition. It cited <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s decision to leave <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and his announcement of major troop reductions in Soviet-ally <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION> and along the Sino-Soviet border. Last August the two sides for the first time held direct talks on how to solve the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> conflict, and in October they settled most of their disputes along the eastern sector of the 5,000-mile border. Qian, returning from his historic visit to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in December, said, `` the most important result was that we started the normalization process.'' But the Chinese also emphasize there will be no regression to the relationship of the 1950s, when the newly founded communist state in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> depended on Soviet economic aid and followed the Soviet lead in international affairs. Normal relations with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Review said in an indirect reference to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, `` will not affect the development of friendly relations between <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and other countries. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, whose own normalization of relations with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was in part spurred by common concern over the Soviet military threat, has welcomed the Sino-Soviet rapprochement, saying it will ease tensions.

 Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> today was conducting a rare, hurry-up survey of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members that leaves open the possibility of a public vote on the 50 percent congressional pay raise scheduled to take effect next week. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, asked if he would schedule a vote should members demand one in the survey, said, `` If the members want it, yes, of course.'' But House Majority Whip <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif., said, `` I do n't think there will be a vote He predicted that in return for the raise becoming law on Feb. 8, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> will approve a day later a package of outside-income and campaign-finance restrictions applying to members. In the survey sent to <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members late Monday, the speaker said he wanted to be `` faithful to the wishes'' of lawmakers, and asked whether they demanded a vote before Feb. 8. An <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> survey of the 100 senators, meantime, found that 88 plan to vote against the pay raise and six for it, with the other six either undecided or unwilling to disclose their position. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> awaited the replies of his colleagues as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> began two days of hearings on the issue that has dominated the early days of the congressional session. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Cutler </PERSON>, the chairman of a federal pay commission that recommended the increase, defended the proposed $ 45,000 raise before the panel but said lawmakers should retain a similar increase for judges and federal bureaucrats if they do n't accept it for themelves. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has acted in other ways to blunt the impact of the proposal to raise congressional pay from $ 89,500 to $ 135,000. Negotiators for the speaker and the Republican leadership have tentatively agreed to major elements of a package to severely restrict outside income. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said he would keep the anwers confidential but asked members, `` Tell me how you really feel.'' In addition to asking about a vote, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> asked if members: thought the raises proposed by former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> were fair; would cut the 50 percent proposal to 30 percent, thus offsetting what <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members can keep in speech honoraria; would support a strict ban on all honoraria, and would vote against rescinding the raise if it meant a loss of income, assuming an honoraria ban passes. Most of the six senators who told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> they planned to vote for the raise said they will do so only if honoraria are banned in return. It was unclear how many of the possible `` yes'' votes in the survey were firm, since the language of the pay rejection resolution was still under discussion. More than a quarter of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has sponsored legislation that would roll back the increase if it becomes law on Feb. 8 as expected. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders also are negotiating whether to restrict outside income beyond a simple ban on honoraria _ the catchall term covering speaking fees, appearances and articles. House negotiators representing the leadership in both parties have tentatively worked out restrictions that range far beyond an honoraria ban. The raise from $ 89,500 to $ 135,000 for rank-and-file lawmakers can only be stopped if both houses reject the increase. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, has promised senators a vote on rejecting the pay plan, but <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democratic leaders have said they will not allow a vote. The pay proposal, submitted to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s final budget, would give lawmakers, federal judges and top political appointees in the executive branch 50 percent increases. Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, D-Conn., said he will vote for the pay raise but keep only the amount that will replace the money he now earns from honoraria <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> said it is a politically tough choice, and he was critical of those who would `` vote no and take the dough.'' `` To me, that's the height of hypocrisy. That is why people have so much difficulty with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and politicians,'' he said. `` That's where peoples' stomachs begin to turn. You've got to be honest about it.'' Several senators opposed to the raise said they will return the money to the government or give it to charity. Those who said they will support a raise in some form included Dodd, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Vt </LOCATION>., <PERSON> Spark </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsunaga </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, D-N.Y. and <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION> Senators who said they were undecided or refused to disclose their views were <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <PERSON> Slade </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorton </PERSON>, R-Wash., <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON>, R-Ind., <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikulski </PERSON>, D-Md., <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Murkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> The remaining senators said they are against the raise. In the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the tentative agreement on outside income is designed in part to soothe public anger over the size of the increase and the lack of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote. The package, according to leadership sources, would: _ End the honoraria system, which has allowed rank-and-file <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members to keep up $ 26,850 of the money they earn each year from speeches, articles and other appearances _ Abolition of the `` grandfather'' loophole in campaign financing law The loophole has allowed 190 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members who were in office as of Jan. 8, 1980, to stockpile more than $ 39 million in surplus campaign money for their personal use. The provision does not apply to senators. _ Restrict travel, probably through time limits, that is often paid for by special interests who invite lawmakers for speeches and plant tours This would prevent members from getting long vacations at resorts, even if they speak for free. _ Restrict non-honoraria income, such as fees for serving on corporate boards

 Afghan guerrillas who have fought Marxist regimes since 1978 say they want a non-aligned Islamic republic, but not necessarily the kind an Arab nation or the Persians of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would create. `` The people of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> are Moslems,'' <PERSON> Hamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Karzai </PERSON> said, but added: `` We have lived in that location for thousands of years. It's a question of culture `` He's an Arab, I'm an Afghan. He wears skirts, I wear this,'' he said, pointing to his loose cotton trousers and knee-length shirt called a shalwar kameez. `` And we are absolutely different from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Karzai </PERSON> is a spokesman for the seven-party <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Afghan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> based in this ancient, dusty frontier city, and a political officer of the <ORGANIZATION> Afghan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. The front is considered one of the more moderate, Western-oriented parties of mujahedeen, or `` holy warriors.'' <PERSON> Karzai </PERSON> acknowledged that conservative groups have more power within the alliance and said there are differences on how to define an Islamic state even within the Afghan context. <PERSON> Shahruk </PERSON> <PERSON> Gran </PERSON>, a field commander of the moderate <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, said all the guerrillas are Moslems but that does not mean they fit a specific political mold. `` Some people misinterpret <LOCATION> Islam </LOCATION> _ some putting it on a narrow path and some on a broader one,'' he said, `` but I think for all of us it means having the right of choosing our own government.'' He and the other mujahedeen believe that right was usurped in April 1978 when communists seized control of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in a military coup. The insurrection began soon afterward. More than 5 million Afghans have fled the country, most of them to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, the neighbor to the east, and the others to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s western border. The guerrillas use refugee camps as bases and most of their support comes from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Soviet military forces intervened in December 1979 and an estimated 115,000 <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> soldiers were in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> when they began withdrawing May 15 under a U.N.-mediated agreement. All are to be gone by Feb. 15. Gran's reference to broad and narrow paths illustrates the difference between the three moderate parties and the four groups of hardliners who describe themselves as Islamic revolutionaries first and Afghans second. Among the most powerful conservative factions is the <ORGANIZATION> Hezb-i-Islami </ORGANIZATION> faction led by <PERSON> Gulbaddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>. `` Our government should be one of Moslems, especially those who have shed their blood for Allah against the foreign invaders and their puppets,'' he said in an interview last 1988. `` The future of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> is for those who have fought for it and no one else.'' Pressure has been brought from outside, particularly the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, for a softer position now that the Soviets are leaving and the Marxist regime in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> is expected to fall. `` There is room for all of us, but under no circumstances will we accept the communists, not after what they have done,'' said <PERSON> Ghaus </PERSON> <PERSON> Amer </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON> spokesman in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Whatever their differences, the mujahedeen factions agree their government should have friendly relations with neighbors, even the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but be free of foreign interference. `` We have a 2,000-kilometer -LRB- 1,200-mile -RRB- border with the <LOCATION> Russians </LOCATION>, so of course we want good diplomatic relations,'' <PERSON> Karzai </PERSON> said. `` There will be problems with trust, especially at the beginning, but we will have to build those relations gradually.'' Strong as their desire for independence may be, the Afghans will be heavily dependent on foreign aid to rebuild after a decade of war that reduced many cities to rubble. Much of the industry and agriculture is idle or in ruins, and mines litter the landscape. One-third of the prewar population lives in the refugee camps of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and must be repatriated. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials estimate reconstruction and resettlement will cost more than $ 2 billion. Western diplomats in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> expect most Afghans to be preoccupied with rebuilding their lives. One said: `` The question of government is relevant mainly to the political leaders'' of the mujahedeen. `` The Afghans' tradition has been to run their affairs locally with as little interference as possible from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>.''

 Authorities are investigating an extensive Polish espionage ring that spied on the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> and recruited senior Austrian security officers, authorities said Tuesday. They learned of the network through an officer in the Polish intelligence service who defected to the West German counterespionage agency, said an official at the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> on condition of anonymity. Officials said the agents included senior officers of the Austrian state police and Polish emigres. The spies' targets included the West German and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassies in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> as well as Polish emigres and regime critics living in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, according to police sources, speaking on condition of anonymity. A prosecutor's office has begun investigations, but no charges have been filed in the year-old inquiry, a prosecutor said. Some suspects wo n't face prosecution since several offenses date back five years or longer and can no longer be prosecuted under Austrian law, the prosecutor said. The <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Der </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> said a journalist and a retired state police colonel confessed, and some of the agents had worked for the Polish secret service for more than 15 years.

 About 80 demonstrators shut down the Golden Gate Bridge at the height of rush hour this morning to demand faster government action in stopping the spread of AIDS. The demonstrators started blocking lanes about 7:30 a.m. and quickly succeeded in stopping traffic in both directions, said bridge officer <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>. The fog-shrouded bridge reopened at about 8 a.m. <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> cars and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> police were sent to clear lanes for commuter traffic heading into the city from <LOCATION> Marin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. About 20 people were arrested. The closure snarled traffic on Highway 101, which is normally crowded at that hour under the best of conditions. Frustrated motorists shut off their engines and got out of their cars to see what was going on. The group spread a banner across the width of the famous span and handed out leaflets to stalled motorists. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said it was too foggy to tell what the demonstration was about. But a caller to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> bureau in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> said the protest was organized by a group called Stop AIDS Now Or Else. The caller, who did not identify himself, said the demonstrators either have the fatal disease or have been deeply affected by it. `` About 80 people are blocking traffic in protest of the inactivity of the government the last eight years and telling <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> we're not going to remain inactive,'' said the caller. `` We're going to continue to put pressure on <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to do more for people with AIDS.

 Seasonal stirrings are about to lead the nation's groundhogs from their snug burrows in search of _ lady groundhogs. That's right, when the furry mammals set forth in midwinter they could n't care less about making weather predictions, researchers say. It's hormones that get them moving. Only the timing proves a boon for small town chambers of commerce which seek publicity by taking advantage of the appearance of the animals and the associated ancient weather folklore. Feb. 2, known as Groundhog Day in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, has been a time for weather prognostications for centuries. The date is also known as Candlemas in the Christian tradition, a feast somewhat overshadowed by the commercial hype in recent years. The popular idea of predicting winter's end from animal behavior extends back at least to the ancient Celts, and was spread by the Roman legions. Over the centuries farmers came to consider the celebration, occurring about halfway between the winter solstice and the spring equinox, a good time to try to make weather predictions, applying the theory that the rest of winter would be the opposite of that on Candlemas. `` If Candlemas be bright and clear, there'll be two winters in the year,'' goes one traditional British rhyme. `` If Candlemas bring clouds and rain, go winter, and come not again.'' Similar beliefs are reported from <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. So serious was this taken that some German farmers were said to have preferred to see a wolf in the stable than that Candlemas day be pleasant and clear. It was the Germans who settled in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> who brought to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> the tradition of predicting the weather on this date. In <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> they had looked to the first movements of hibernating bears, hedgehogs and badgers for weather predictions. On this side of the ocean the honor fell to the woodchuck _ also known as the groundhog or marmot. Woodchucks do begin to leave hibernation at this time of year _ at least in some parts of the nation. But scientists report that what's on the animals' minds is sex, not weather. The males come out of the burrows first, while female groundhogs wo n't awaken for a week or more. In the meantime, the males search for food and fight among themselves according to researchers in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. The folk belief, however, is that animals somehow know future weather and, if they end their hibernation and sally forth, spring is close. Thus developed the worry that a shadow might frighten the animal back into its home, leading to a prediction of six more weeks of winter. Most folks consider that bad news. In the more northerly areas of the country, however, some people are said to hope that the groundhog will see its shadow _ predicting that winter will last `` only'' six more weeks. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Naval Observatory, meanwhile, relays a report that sailors who have been stationed at <LOCATION> Guantanamo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> say local people in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> have a somewhat similar tradition. That is that around this date banana rats find a tree to climb and relax in. If they settle at a low level of the tree it will be a bad year for hurricanes, while rats climbing high in the trees means a mild hurricane season, the belief goes. For the more religious, the church observations on Feb. 2 are known as the Feast of the Presentation of the Lord and the Feast of the Purification of <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>. This celebrates the time when <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, as required by Jewish law, went to the Temple in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> to be purified 40 days after giving birth to a son, and to present that son, <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>, to God. That presentation of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>, said to bring light to the world, helped lead to the custom of blessing, on this date, the candles destined to be used for the rest of the year. Hence, the name Candlemas. And even those candles extend the weather-folklore connection, with the superstition that a candle blessed on this date will protect a home if lighted during a thunderstorm.

But the arrested man denied he was <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> and plans to fight extradition to <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ogden </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>, 47, and his business partner, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, 25, have been sought by police in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> since mid-1988, when it was discovered that <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> was not dead and <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> had disappeared.

When he was arrested, the suspect carried identification cards under 13 names, authorities said. The suspect carried no identification under the name <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> but scars around his eyes, apparently from plastic surgery, convinced authorities the man they arrested was <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ogden </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ogden </PERSON> said fingerprints taken after the suspect was arrested would be compared today with those in <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>'s military records. <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, who was appointed by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> to represent the man, said his client is not <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>, but <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Snowden </PERSON>, as indicated on the passport he was carrying. The arrested man was charged with theft by fraud on a warrant from <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> set bond at $ 5 million, and the man was jailed. <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> also are accused of stealing about $ 2 million from Just Sweats, which they founded in 1985.

 <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, designated to head the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, promised today aggressive and timely enforcement of environmental laws, saying the environment can be protected without hindering economic growth. <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>'s nomination by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as head of the federal government's key environmental agency is expected to win early <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approval. His appearance today before the Environment and <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> prompted bipartisan praise from members. Sen. <PERSON> Quentin </PERSON> <PERSON> Burdick </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.D. </LOCATION>, committee chairman, called <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, who is president of the World Wildlife Fund, `` a person ... who appreciates that a great nation must be a good steward of its land, its air, its water and its natural resources.'' `` I'm pleased to join the chorus of admirers and welcomers,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, noting that <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> was introduced to the panel by no fewer than five senators from three states. <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> told the senators that while he plans to enforce environmental laws aggressively `` whenever it is warranted to safeguard public health and environmental quality'' he also will seek to deal with environmental problems through consensus and cooperation. `` We no longer have the time or luxury of allowing the bitterness, the polarization, the wasted resources and other excesses'' that have marked the conflicts in recent yeas between environmentalists and industry. <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said he has spent his career in the environmental movement `` advocating environmental protection and economic growth'' and added that he was `` convinced we can find it.'' <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> ticked off a list of priority issues facing the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> such as finding ways to come to grips with the problems of acid rain, depletion of the earth's ozone layer, global warming, ocean pollution and cleaning up toxic waste dumps. But he said the problems posed by acid rain are `` ahead of everything else'' and promised early <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> action to develop legislation aimed at dealing with the issue. `` We expect to offer a comprehensive proposal for congressional consideration as soon as possible'' aimed at achieving a `` substantial reduction of acid rain by the end of the century,'' <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said. Several senators noted <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>'s desire to deal with environmental issues through consensus and expressed concern that the approach might lead to inaction on part of the EPA. `` Will you conciliate, mediate, negotiate away our environmental laws?'' asked Sen. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON>, D-Mont., who nevertheless expressed support for <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>'s nomination Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON>, D-Conn., urged <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> to be `` an environmental advocate'' in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration and allow the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> not to be a `` reluctant combatant as it often has been'' in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration `` You can count on me being an advocate,'' replied <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>.

 A lone hijacker seized control today of a Colombian airliner with 116 passengers aboard, authorities said, and surrendered after diverting the plane to <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>.

 Staffers of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> were `` determined to maintain the natural fire regime'' as fires grew out of control there last summer, according to a memo by a park service official visiting from another park. The memo by <ORGANIZATION> Sequoyia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> fire specialist <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> staffers `` were bemoaning the fact that new -LRB- fire -RRB- starts, as mandated by the secretary'' had to be suppressed, according to a copy of the memo made public today at a congressional hearing on the fires. The Aug. 15 memo was submitted by <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> to the western regional director after a week-long visit to Yellowstone that began July 28. On July 21, then-Interior Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> ordered that what some have called the `` let it burn'' policy be suspended and all fires fought. Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Marlenee </PERSON>, R-Mont., submitted the memorandum at a joint hearing of the national parks subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the forests subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> did not say that anyone disobeyed <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON>'s order. But <PERSON> Marlenee </PERSON> suggested to <PERSON> Denis </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, that the memo showed that <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON>'s policy `` was not being carried out.'' <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> said the service would `` absolutely'' look into points raised by the memo. Among other things, <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> said, `` The tactics used for these fires may well result in the suggestion that <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> was using suppression dollars to achieve natural resource benefits, a patently illegal use of these funds.'' Also, he said, <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s pre-existing fire plan `` was deficient in not stating how many acres should be permitted to burn at any time.'' <PERSON> Marlenee </PERSON> and other members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> from the <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> area have protested that the park service endangered their constituents' businesses and property in neglecting to fight the fires until they were too far gone for effective suppression The park service and environmental groups supporting it argue that fire is necessary to regenerate the high lodgepole pine forests of <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>, and only the unforeseeable and exceptional drought made 1988's fires so devastating to normal tourist and other activity.

<HEAD>Air Transport Group Urges Delay Of New Denver Airport</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A powerful airline industry group has urged further study before construction begins on <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>'s proposed new $ 3 billion airport. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents most major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines, including <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>'s two largest carriers, opposes the city's plan to break ground on the new airport this summer. It will voice that position during public hearings in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> this week. The new airport is planned about 20 miles farther out of the city than <LOCATION> Stapleton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, located on the city's eastern outskirts `` This airport is n't needed right now,'' <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the Washington-based association, said Monday. `` We've already got a lot of unused capacity right now. This needs further evaluation.'' The group has n't decided what an appropriate timetable should be, she said. <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON> said the association decided last week to participate in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>'s public hearings, partly on the advice of <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> airlines. Both carriers argue that <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> is planning the new airport too quickly, and both are represented on the transport association's executive committee. Mayor <PERSON> Federico </PERSON> <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> and Gov. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> say a new airport is needed because <PERSON> Stapleton </PERSON>, among the nation's busiest airports, ca n't handle its traffic volume Critics of the new aiport say <PERSON> Stapleton </PERSON>'s volume has fallen off somewhat in the past year and that <PERSON> Stapleton </PERSON> should be expanded rather than building at a new site The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> supports the airport plan, said <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Leyden </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Housing Affordability Measure Down Slightly in December</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An index measuring the ability of the typical American family to buy a home edged down in December, leaving buyers with slightly less purchasing power than they had a month earlier, a real estate trade group said Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> said its affordability index was 112.3 in December, down from 112.8 in November. The December figure means that a family earning the median income of $ 32,100 had 12.3 percent more income than needed to qualify for a mortgage covering 80 percent of the purchase price of a median-priced home. For all of 1988, the index was 113.4, down slightly from 113.8 in the previous year, as family incomes mostly keep pace with increases in mortgage interest rates and home prices. The median price of an existing home in December fell $ 300 from the previous month to $ 87,700, meaning half the homes sold for more and half for less. Median family income rose $ 104 and the mortgage rate used to calculate the index rose from 9.48 percent to 9.61 percent, representing a composite of fixed and adjustable rates. The affordability index, which has been above 100 since June 1986, was at its highest point for 1988 in April, when it reached 113.8.

<HEAD>Bush Pledges to `Wring' Waste out of Military Procurement System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NORFOLK, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> pledged Tuesday to `` wring the last drop of waste and mismanagement'' out of the scandal-scarred military procurement system and said that cost overruns hurt the national security. Standing on the sun-splashed deck of the aircraft carrier <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> delivered his message in a speech to thousands of sailors at the <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION> and Air Station, the largest naval installation in the country. A number of representatives of defense contractors also were in the audience. Still fighting off a cold, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had a raspy voice and coughed repeatedly during his remarks. He said later he had been `` just croaking away'' and was n't sure during his speech that he would be able to finish. It was his first out-of-town trip since becoming president, and his speech came against the backdrop of a fraud and bribery scandal in the military procurement system. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he believed that the overwhelming majority of procurement officers and defense contractors care about the quality of the ships, planes and weapons that they sell to the Pentagon. `` I am determined to make sure that every single one of them does,'' he said. The president said that cost overruns are not a new problem but `` they are still wrong and hurt the national security, particularly when budgets are tight. `` We want tighter controls and higher standards in weapons procurement, and we will get tighter controls and higher standards in weapons procurement,'' he said. Saying he will insure that the military has the proper support from the country, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I firmly believe that the vital first step to broadening our national consensus on defense is to wring the last drop of waste and mismanagement out of the way we buy our weapons. And that's what we intend to do.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> flew by helicopter from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and landed directly on the deck of the carrier. A staff helicopter that landed first sent a gust of wind across the deck that nearly blew away the red carpet taped down for the president. It was rolled up and then laid out again once <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> landed. As part of security precautions, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s armored limousine was put on the ship's deck. It rode alongside him as he walked. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not wear an overcoat in the mild weather _ the temperature was in the 50s _ although the sailors and many members of the audience wore jackets and coats to ward off the chill of the wind. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who came down with a cold late last week, said he was feeling better. Despite his cold, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> seemed in good spirits. After his remarks, he ate lunch in a mess hall with enlisted sailors, dining on egg drop soup, Cantonese meat sticks, pork-fried rice, a spring roll, shrimp and a glass of milk. He asked if the chow was `` show business food'' or if the sailors always ate as well. They said they generally ate pretty well. `` You want a little Trivial Pursuit?'' he asked a sailor. He said he had been stationed at nearby <LOCATION> Oceana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> `` a thousand years ago'' as World War II was coming to an end. `` I had just gotten orders to go back overseas,'' he recalled. `` Thank God, the war ended.'' Introducing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to the audience, Vice Adm. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunleavy </PERSON>, the air commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION>, told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` you're back to your roots'' and proclaimed a homecoming. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was a naval combat fighter in World War II and recalled some of his experiences. Saying he would demand high standards from defense contractors, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I've been inside a submerged submarine while depth charges were going off all around it. And I know what it's like to hear the vessel strain and shake and pray to God that the people in charge of buying and building cared as much about the vessel as you do.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spent weeks aboard a submarine during the war after he was rescued as sea when his plane was shot down.

<HEAD>1989-90 Budget Calls for Billion Dollar Deficit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Finance Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> on Tuesday introduced a $ 30.7 billion budget for the 1990 fiscal year with a $ 1 billion deficit that was bigger than expected. The document presented to the <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION>, or parliament, calls for a 19 percent increase in the government's operating budget to be partly offset by a reduction in the development budget and increases in taxes and fees. Defense outlays are to rise to $ 5.9 billion in the fiscal year beginning April 1, from $ 5.05 billion in the current year. Part of the rise in military spending is to cover increased costs for countering the 14-month Palestinian uprising in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Dealing with the <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> revolt has been costing the government about $ 14 million a month. The budget is expected to win easy approval in parliament, where a coalition between <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>' <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc controls four-fifths of the seats. But tax increases and cuts in food subsidies have already brought an angry public response. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> has pledged to hold down federal spending. In announcing his economic austerity program on Jan. 1, he said the aim was to try to hold this year's deficit to the same level as last year's $ 833 million in red ink. He did not explain Tuesday why the goal was not attained, but he told parliament that `` We have learned that nothing feeds inflation more than a budget deficit. ... Therefore, we decided to cut the expected budget deficit.'' The nation's massive <ORGANIZATION> Histadrut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> federation </ORGANIZATION>, which represents about 80 percent of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> workers, has pledged to oppose <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>' plan, contending it will increase unemployment and significantly raise food, transport and insurance costs that workers ca n't afford An announced earlier, the budget calls for reducing government subsidies for food and public transport. Fees for universities, hospitals and insurance are to increase, and new taxes will be imposed on cars and imported services. Israeli TV estimated up to 4,000 government workers could lose their jobs under the austerity program. The Israeli economy grew a sluggish 1 percent last year, down sharply from 5.2 percent growth in 1987. About half of the slowdown has been blamed on the uprising, which has reduced tourism, business investment and sales to the territories.

<HEAD>Radio Pioneer Pegeen Fitzgerald Dead</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Friends mourning the death of <PERSON> Pegeen </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> recalled how she and her husband, partners in a groundbreaking radio format, wove their way into the hearts of ardent listeners from <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> to average New Yorkers. `` If you listened to them, it seemed like you were eavesdropping on a conversation with a loving but not always an agreeing couple,'' said radio host <PERSON> John </PERSON> A. Gambling, who worked with Mrs. <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON>, at WOR-AM. Mrs. <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON>, 78, died of breast cancer Monday in her apartment, said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Garner </PERSON>, a personal assistant. It was from that apartment that the Fitzgeralds most often broadcast their unscripted show _ a program which featured discussions of the couple's everyday life, their friends and current events. `` They got mad at each other on the air. They celebrated things on the air,'' said <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Novak </PERSON>, a television producer who apprenticed with the <ORGANIZATION> Fitzgeralds </ORGANIZATION>. `` Pegeen always said, ` We do n't read from any scripts.' The show, which first aired in 1937, ended with the death of <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> in 1982. Mrs. <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> continued on WOR for another year before moving to public radio station <ORGANIZATION> WNYC </ORGANIZATION>, where she was on the air until last spring. The Fitzgeralds' program was the first of its kind, and quickly inspired an assortment of imitators. The monthly bills could provide a show's worth of material. As the couple chatted, the sounds of their many pet cats or their cleaning woman running the vacuum could be heard in the background. Their only preparation for the program was a cursory reading of the newspapers and listeners' mail. The couple's on-air arguments were the result of honest anger; <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> once became so upset during one breakfast show that he returned to bed and left his wife alone to finish the show. `` We're a true soap opera,'' she once remarked to a reporter. Mrs. <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> first took to the airwaves when employees of a department store where she worked had to fill the air time of a store-owned radio station. In 1937, a WOR-AM executive offered to put a microphone in her office at the store and she soon was doing a half-hour show during her lunch hour. When she caught pneumonia, management asked if she could go on air from her hospital bed and later from her home while she was convalescing. Because she did not want her announcer, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, to see her in a bathrobe, she asked if her husband could take his place. The husband-wife combination became a radio first, and First Lady <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> once went to their apartment to watch. Ardent listeners protested vigorously whenever station executives tried to remove the Fitzgeralds from the airwaves. The listeners were so devoted to the couple that several willed their pets to the animal-loving couple. Mrs. <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> was survived by four sisters and one brother.

<HEAD>OSHA Proposes New Protections for Electric Utility Workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government proposed Tuesday to expand safety requirements at electrical utility companies and said the changes could prevent about one-third of the 75 work-related deaths in the industry each year. The proposal by the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> would cover 660,000 employees of electric utilities and related services, the government said. The regulations, subject to a public comment period before they take effect, were drafted in cooperation with the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a utility industry trade group. The guidelines would affect such routine tasks as using ladders to enter manholes as well as work on exposed electric lines by tree-trimmers and repair workers. <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> said it would cost about $ 21 million to bring utilities in compliance. The regulations would not cover construction and telecommunications workers who face similar hazards. Those workers are covered by separate standards. The tighter rules were proposed for electric utility workers because they encounter far greater risk of electric shock and falls, <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. The proposal does not cover electric power plants not run by utilities but <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> said it was considering extending the rules at a later date to cover all electric power generation, transmission and distribution. The agency said full compliance with the regulations should eliminate 24 to 28 of the approximately 75 work-related fatalities each year among covered workers. More than 3,200 injuries also should be prevented, <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> said. Electric shock accounts for half the deaths and injuries in the industry. To protect workers from shock, the guidelines would require wider use of protective equipment such as insulating blankets, gloves and sleeves. A number of training and safety measures also are included in the proposed guidelines.

<TEXT>
 A cold, stiff wind rips down <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> as Terry Page stands on the deck of a floating shantytown. Overhead, a man yells from a passing car on the First Street bridge: `` Get a job.'' `` Right there is someone who does n't understand the issues of the homeless,'' said Page, who knows the problems first hand. Page, 29, spends many of his days and nights on the shantytown, three scrapwood huts lashed together atop styrofoam blocks that have been anchored in the middle of the lake that bisects downtown <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>. The floating eyesore _ deliberately ugly to prick the consciences of the thousands who drive or jog by daily _ has been floating in the lake since the end of October. It is the creation of the <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> SPAC </ORGANIZATION>, an organization founded by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> that has performed similar publicity stunts to increase awareness of the homeless. Last year, <ORGANIZATION> SPAC </ORGANIZATION> members took a gosling hostage and threatened to cook and eat it if the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> did n't meet with them. They got their meeting. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 49, was briefly held by police for trespassing last year when he and other homeless people broke into and lived for several days in an abandoned house owned by the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION>. When the state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> convened in January, <ORGANIZATION> SPAC </ORGANIZATION> members panhandled at the Capitol for quarters so they could park a couch in a metered parking space. The group is now lobbying the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to build a permanent tent city for the city's 2,700 homeless people. Although Austin winters are generally mild with temperatures in the 50s, the thermometer occasionally dips below freezing. `` I try to figure out something that is humorous and to the point. A lot of people have heard the issues and have turned a deaf ear,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said in a recent interview. Acting City Manager <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> says <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and his group have been forceful. `` They've done a very effective job in keeping their issue before the public.'' Others who try to serve the area's down-and-out mistrust <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> SPAC </ORGANIZATION>. `` They are a self-appointed group serving themselves. As far as homelessness and needing of assistance, they are phonies,'' said <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, director of Helping Our Brothers Out, or <ORGANIZATION> HOBO </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> HOBO </ORGANIZATION> provides transitional housing for homeless people and works with other human service agencies to get help the needy. `` I personally do n't feel these people -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> SPAC </ORGANIZATION> members -RRB- should come under the heading of the homeless,'' <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said. `` They should come under the heading of chemical abusers. `` A lot of these guys have been on the street most of their lives. They would like to use the government services to sustain them while they go about taking care of their drug habits,'' he said. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> concedes some <ORGANIZATION> SPAC </ORGANIZATION> members have drug and alcohol problems, but he said <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> misses his group's point. `` We're strictly a high pressure advocacy group. We're a non-providing group; we're a referral agency'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> SPAC </ORGANIZATION> has only five people on its council, but 20 to 30 people check in daily at its offices, said <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON>, sergeant-at-arms and executive administrator. `` HOBO has a low outlook on street people and we do n't,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. `` I do n't practice telling someone how to run their life. We do n't push re-hab on them, we do n't push religion. We try to get people into some type of housing with dignity.'' Housing is the critical issue. `` If a person has an address and a telephone then they can get employment,'' said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, originally from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> but who has lived in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> for the past 15 months. `` And then the next thing would be health care services.'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, Page and a man named <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> who refused to give his last name live in the floating three-plex. <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> said the structure on <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> probably violates a city ordinance, but added, `` We're somewhat reasonable about giving these people a way to advertise.'' To circumvent the ordinance, the three men have purchased a fishing license and keep several lines in the water. Although short on dignity, the huts have many comforts. Page and <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> built shelves inside their units. They have heaters, sleeping bags, camping stoves, lanterns, radios and an ice chest full of food. They also have a car battery rigged up to power a light at night. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> has a rowboat to ferry people and supplies from shore. All the materials to construct the boats have been donated. And as a symbol, the boats have served well, Page said. `` That's what they're meant to be, eyesores. People ask us, what is this for? We tell them we are protesting about low-income housing. There's not enough of it.''

 The military service exemption for sons of Jewish victims of the Holocaust has been extended to the grandsons of those persecuted, the defense minister said Tuesday. The issue of military service `` is still very sensitive'' for the children of Holocaust survivors, Defense Minister <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Scholz </PERSON> said in an interview with the Hamburg-based Panorama television program. `` The decision to extend the exemption is in keeping with a long-standing desire for reconciliation,'' <PERSON> Scholz </PERSON> said.

The Jewish Council made its request after a <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> court ruled against a Jewish man who asked that he be exempted because his grandfather had been a victim of Nazi persecution.

<TEXT>
 Eye-stinging spruce smoke cloaked dimly lit figures huddled against sub-zero cold at the end of their first long day of learning the tricks of arctic survival. `` Nothin' but a bunch of Boy Scouts with bad language,'' someone quipped. He was partly right. The only scouts were a half-dozen Eskimo Scouts who teach the military how to stay alive when it gets so cold that people from the Lower 48 states ca n't comprehend it. The Scouts' weeklong course 100 miles north of the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Circle </LOCATION> is short on lectures and long on cold. At least four full days and nights are spent in the wilderness 500 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>. Now in its third winter, the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> school has trained about 150 people to cope with temperatures that consistently range in the neighborhood of 40 degrees below zero. It hit 45 below on the last two nights of January's class, and a couple days after the students left, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s great cold wave struck with temperatures down to 50 and 60 below zero. Students run the gamut from <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> troops to raw <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> recruits, and <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> Adjutant General <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaeffer </PERSON> says it is not just non-Alaskans and non-natives that need the training. `` The type of Eskimo we're enlisting today does n't have the survival skills of the older Eskimos,'' says <PERSON> Schaeffer </PERSON>, a participant in the January class. He estimates about half of the Guard is Eskimo or Indian. Because of cultural changes, natives no longer have to rely on the skills handed down for generations, says <PERSON> Schaeffer </PERSON>, an Eskimo from <LOCATION> Kotzebue </LOCATION>. `` We've got a bunch of Eskimos and Indians around here who would have as much trouble -LRB- surviving the cold -RRB- as anyone else.'' <PERSON> Schaeffer </PERSON>, an experienced arctic outdoorsman, says he attended the class to lend it some credibility and assure its permanency and funding. `` We're doing what we should have been doing for years _ taking the skills we've learned from centuries of living here and passing them on,'' the two-star general says. The school was started in response to requests from <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> flight crews, who wanted training similar to that offered at the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Cool School'' at <ORGANIZATION> Eielson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Base near Fairbanks. Maj. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Finney </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> adviser to the 5th Scout Battalion of the 297th Infantry, got together with an <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> hunting buddy, <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> recruited other instructors from the nearby Gwich ` in Indian villages of <LOCATION> Venetie </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yukon </LOCATION>, and they began showing students what it takes to The practical experiences of the natives are backed by scientific data from <PERSON> Finney </PERSON> about human physiology and thermodynamics. <PERSON> Finney </PERSON> says one of the most difficult survival obstacles is to overcome the macho approach to the cold. Too often, soldiers are afraid to admit they are freezing, he says. At 40 below zero, severe frostbite can occur within two to four hours as the result of a series of minor errors or less than an hour from one serious mistake, <PERSON> Finney </PERSON> says. The worst injury in the six previous classes at <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> involved a Special Forces sergeant who suffered serious frostbite to nine toes. Part of the cause was an experimental boot, but much of it was a stubborn unwillingness to acknowledge the cold, <PERSON> Finney </PERSON> says. `` Nobody knows better than you if you're cold,'' <PERSON> Finney </PERSON> preaches. `` If you're cold, do something about it. Deal with it.'' Shelter construction is one of the areas of major emphasis at the school. Types of shelters depend on the materials at hand, and the foothills of the <LOCATION> Brooks </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Range </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> have plentiful supplies of stunted black spruce. Boughs are used for ground insulation and to thatch the sides and roofs of lean-tos. Limbless trunks become the framework for the shelters. Wood is gathered for all-night fires. Instructors show students how to snare hares and catch fish to supplement their diet. But this part of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> does n't support a bunny population large enough to feed two dozen hungry troops. Ice-fishing is somewhat more productive. Ideally, a caribou would be killed, and instructors detail the many uses for the meat, hide and entrails. The Gwich ` in have survived on caribou for But this January, the nearest caribou were 80 miles away.

Both men praised pilot R.C. <PERSON> Maulay </PERSON> for his quick and expert evasive action. `` We drank a champagne toast after crossing the Afghan border,'' <PERSON> Schumaker </PERSON> said. Maulay is a veteran of flights in an out of the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> airport, which requires precipitous corkscrew landings and takeoffs. The airport sits on the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> plain, which is turned into a geological bowl by surrounding hills and mountains. Planes routinely drop flares designed to divert heat-seeking missiles fired by Moslem guerrillas camped in the heights around the city. In closing the embassy, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> cited fears of deteriorating security after all Red Army soldiers leave. Soviet military forces entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979 to help the Marxist government fight Moslem guerrillas. All are to be gone by Feb. 15 under a U.N.-mediated withdrawal agreement. Other Western nations also are closing their embassies. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> removed its remaining staff members last Saturday. The last <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> personnel to leave were <PERSON> Glassman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Schumaker </PERSON>, five other members of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> staffers and four <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Marine guards. Maulay, the pilot, modestly did not mention the near-collision. He said the chartered jet carried 8 tons of cargo on the two-hour flight from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> to to <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, and his deputy, <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, greeted the Americans, who smiled broadly and carried their luggage to limousines and vans. Two large embassy trucks loaded the rest of the gear. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> embassy issued a statement saying most would return to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> soon. Most non-communist nations, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, removed their ambassadors from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> in protest after Soviet troops arrived. The withdrawal also constituted a diplomatic snub and refusal to recognize a succession of governments put in power by assassination and party purges.

 A man named Noid who held two pizza employees hostage for five hours at gunpoint was angry over the pizza chain's `` Avoid the Noid'' commercials, the man's uncle said Tuesday. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Noid </PERSON>, 22, was arrested Monday after the five-hour standoff at a Domino's pizza store ended with the hostages' escape. He was being held Tuesday on $ 250,000 bond in the <LOCATION> DeKalb </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jail pending a Feb. 17 hearing on two counts of kidnapping, two counts of aggravated assault and theft by extortion. Noid had expressed anger to his mother, <PERSON> Julia </PERSON>, about the commercials, `` but I guess she did n't think it would rise to this,'' his uncle, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Noid </PERSON>, said.

 The government will still accept refugees who fled after September's military coup, even though the deadline for return under a repatriation program expired, a government spokesman said Tuesday. The spokesman, <PERSON> Kyaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Sann </PERSON>, said 2,313 students and others who fled had already returned from border areas. The government estimated that 3,000 people fled to the Thai-Burmese border and other frontier areas after the Sept. 18 coup and shootings of hundreds of anti-government demonstrators. The guerrillas put the number of refugees at more than 5,000. <PERSON> Sann </PERSON> said although the formal deadline for return would not be extended, refugees would still be accepted at 27 government centers. Most of the students joined Karens and other ethnic minority groups fighting the central government. Human rights groups have accused Burmese authorities of arresting, torturing and executing some who returned. The government denies the charges.

<TEXT>
 The government said Tuesday it has no evidence that the suspicious deaths of two priests within 10 days were politically provoked. `` There is no ground to suppose that there is someone going around <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and spreading death among priests,'' government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> told a news conference. Authorities performed an autopsy Tuesday on the body of the Rev. <PERSON> Stanislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Suchowolec </PERSON>, 31, a pro-Solidarity priest found dead Monday after a fire swept his apartment in the northeastern city of <LOCATION> Bialystok </LOCATION>, 119 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. Urban said an investigation is continuing into the death of another priest, the Rev. <PERSON> Stefan </PERSON> <PERSON> Niedzielak </PERSON>, 74, who died of a broken neck on Jan. 21. <PERSON> Niedzielak </PERSON> was sympathetic to the Solidarity movement. `` There is no evidence to assume or suppose the existence of a political provocation'' in the deaths, Urban said. The Rev. <PERSON> Cezary </PERSON> <PERSON> Potocki </PERSON>, chancellor of <LOCATION> Bialystok </LOCATION> district, said <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> officials attended the autopsy of Suchowolec, who worked in the parish of the Immaculate Heart of <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>. <PERSON> Suchowolec </PERSON> died apparently from smoke inhalation, according to results of an initial investigation by the local prosecutor and church officials, Urban said. The cause of the fire still is unknown. A housekeeper sounded the alarm after smelling smoke early Monday morning, Urban said. `` The doors which were closed from the inside were forced open. There was a considerable amount of smoke in the room. Father <PERSON> Suchowolec </PERSON> was lying next to the couch. His dead dog was lying there too,'' he said. `` The windows in the room were shut. The window and door panes were blackened with soot. Maybe the electric circuits were cut off, which could have been the source -LRB- of the fire -RRB-,'' said Urban. Suchowolec actively supported the banned trade union Solidarity. Early in his six years as a priest, he served for three years as vicar in <LOCATION> Suchowola </LOCATION>, home village of the Rev. <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Popieluszko </PERSON>, who was murdered by security police in 1984. <PERSON> Suchowolec </PERSON> had organized pilgrimages to <PERSON> Popieluszko </PERSON>'s gravesite in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Zofia </PERSON> <PERSON> Romaszewska </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intervention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abidance </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Suchowolec </PERSON> had informed the commission that he had been assaulted and that his car had been tampered with at least twice. <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Romaszewski </PERSON>, another member of the commission which records human rights' violations, said <PERSON> Suchowolec </PERSON>'s car had been stoned Aug. 4, 1988, and two days later his parents' apartment was burned. <PERSON> Romaszewski </PERSON> said the incidents were fully documented, but Urban said no threats were reported to investigative authorities. Chancellor <PERSON> Zdzislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Krol </PERSON> of the church's <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> district said <PERSON> Niedzielak </PERSON> had received anonymous threats before his death, but the chancellor had not taken them seriously at the time. <PERSON> Niedzielak </PERSON> maintained a shrine to Poles killed in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> during World War II. More than 5,000 people attended his funeral in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Man Charged With Fraud After Allegedly Posing As Astronaut</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A man who claimed to be an astronaut sported impressive medals, uniforms and badges and even wangled a 10-minute audience with the lord mayor of <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, 27, was grounded Monday when he was arraigned on charges of larceny and fraud and ordered held on $ 100,000 bail. He was charged with duping a youth into joining the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and then claiming he could get him released from his commitment for $ 2,000. Hunt claimed to be a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> captain, a decorated fighter pilot and told convincing but false stories about himself to his wife, his in-laws, some people at the <ORGANIZATION> Bedford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, an <ORGANIZATION> Aer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lingus </ORGANIZATION> pilot and cadets at the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Naval Academy in <LOCATION> Annapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, according to state Trooper <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Palombo </PERSON>, a state police investigator. <PERSON> Palombo </PERSON> said he started looking into the stories earlier this month. `` I did some checking and found out there was no such animal as <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> who was a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> captain and fighter pilot or astronaut,'' he said. The charges against the man stem from allegations he persuaded an 18-year-old Saugus youth to enlist in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and then told the teen-ager's parents their son could get out of his commitment for $ 2,000, <PERSON> Palombo </PERSON> said. They paid him that amount twice; once in a check he said was no good and then in cash, though he later cashed the check, <PERSON> Palombo </PERSON> said. Last summer the man married a woman who, like her parents, was convinced that he was an astronaut. The man showed them burned kitchen tiles he claimed came from the explosion of the Challenger space shuttle three years ago. `` When I arrested him Saturday noon at his home, his wife still thought he was an astronaut,'' <PERSON> Palombo </PERSON> said. The charges against <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> also include his alleged use of his wife's credit card for a variety of charges, including the charter of a private jet to <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>. He later wrote the crew complimenting them on their performance. `` Being a former astronaut, I would like to make note that the landing in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> was equal to our landing of the shuttle Atlantis,'' the letter stated. Before he flew with his wife to <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> just before Christmas, he called ahead to tell officials in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> he was an astronaut, <PERSON> Palombo </PERSON> said. `` He was given a big state welcome and made an honorary citizen of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> by Lord Mayor of <PERSON> Dublin </PERSON> <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Briscoe </PERSON> because he was an astronaut,'' according to <PERSON> Palombo </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Briscoe </PERSON>'s spokeswoman, who requested anonymity, said <PERSON> Briscoe </PERSON> gave Hunt a 10-minute audience on Oct. 8 at <ORGANIZATION> Mansion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, his official headquarters, after being told <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> was a visiting astronaut. A source close to <PERSON> Briscoe </PERSON>, also requesting anonymity, said <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> told him <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> was arranging for him to be married in <LOCATION> Westminster </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Abbey </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Briscoe </PERSON> quickly realized the man was `` not the full shilling,'' but politely went along with the charade, the source said. `` He's very good,'' the trooper said. `` I had him in the cruiser and I asked him one question. He talked for 10 minutes, without hesitating, from <LOCATION> Medford </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` I said to him, ` But you never answered my question,' and he said, ` That's right.'''

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said Tuesday he would work to restore public faith in his government, which has been shaken by a major financial scandal. Speaking to members of his <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> hours before leaving on a weeklong <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trip, he said `` political reform is my top priority.'' `` No matter how difficult, I will restore the people's trust in government and earnestly work toward political reform,'' <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said. `` I will thoroughly enforce discipline in my administration and bring back public faith in it.'' For the last six months, Japanese politics has been rocked by disclosures that top politicians or their aides profited from shares in a real estate development firm because they bought them before public trading. When the sales went public, the shares soared in value. The purchases of shares in the firm, a subsidiary of the information conglomerate <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, were not illegal but raised questions of political ethics, fund-raising and influence-peddling. Three of <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s Cabinet ministers have resigned in the last three months because they received political donations from Recruit or were linked to purchase of the shares. `` In the wake of the Recruit problem, we have been subject to severe criticism over political ethics,'' <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said in his speech to the conservative party, which he addressed in his capacity as its president. `` Political reform should be the basis for all reform.'' He said he had assembled an advisory group on political reform that has begun drawing up concrete measures to deal with the problem. The political opposition calls the Recruit affair proof of corruption in the governing party, although a few opposition politicians have also been implicated. The opposition has demanded that the entire <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> step down and <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> call new elections, but he has refused. In an editorial last week, the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION> said the scandal had damaged the image of politicians. `` It does nothing but deepen the nation's political discredit,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> said. `` <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> must make clear to the people how he will put an end to such a shameful political situation and take political responsibility.'' The Liberal Democrats have been buffeted in both electoral and opinion polls in recent weeks. A recent survey by <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> showed support for <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> had plummeted from 53.4 percent in September to 35.9 percent. A poll released Saturday by the <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> put public support at 28 percent, down from 57 percent a month earlier. The party also suffered a setback in elections last weekend in <LOCATION> Kitakyushu </LOCATION>, western <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, where the opposition Socialists and Communists made slight gains in municipal balloting. Opposition politicians also claim a new tax package, which introduces a general consumption tax of 3 percent and lowers corporate and higher-bracket income taxes, was steamrolled through <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and benefits the wealthy. Also Tuesday, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> disclosed his personal assets, saying he was worth more than $ 1 million.

<HEAD>FDA Panel Develops Guidelines on Dental X-rays</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Food and Drug Administration panel said Tuesday that children with healthy teeth may need dental X-rays no more than once every year or two, and dentally healthy adults once every two or three years. The panel's guidelines, reported in the current issue of the Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, were prompted by concern among some experts about the frequency of dental X-rays, both overuse and underuse. `` Although the radiation risk from a dental X-ray is extremely low, our goal is to eliminate any unneeded radiation exposure,'' <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said in an news release on the guidelines Tuesday. `` Until these guidelines were developed, there were few concrete criteria a dentist could use in deciding when X-rays were needed,'' he said. Young also stressed the flexibility of the guidelines, saying `` these are not hard and fast rules. In deciding whether an X-ray is needed, the dentist must use clinical judgment in evaluating the patient's needs.'' The guidelines say children and adults generally do not need X-rays each time they see a dentist if they are not at high risk and show no signs of dental disease. High-risk patients include those with enamel defects, poor dental hygiene or inadequate exposure to fluoride, or those who come from families with poor dental health. The guidelines say that children visiting a dentist for the first time will need X-rays. Most children who have not developed cavities and do not show any other symptoms of dental disease will need X-rays generally once every year or two, according to the guidelines. X-rays also are sometimes needed to check on the proper growth and development of permanent molars. The panel's guidelines are supported by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dentistry </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radiology </ORGANIZATION>, the American <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pediatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dentistry </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Periodontology </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said.

 A juror hopes <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s manslaughter conviction will send a message to other child abusers. But prison sentences alone wo n't solve the complex problem, experts said Tuesday. `` Think about what you're doing,'' juror <PERSON> Anne-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, a physical therapist, implored all child abusers after the verdict Monday night. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> will face a maximum prison term of eight and one-third to 25 years for fatally injuring 6-year-old <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>, his illegally adopted daughter, on Nov. 1, 1987. `` It's important that these cases be prosecuted _ but I am not sure that ... will deter anything,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Krugman </PERSON>, director of the Denver-based <ORGANIZATION> Kempe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prevention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treatment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION> and Neglect. `` The idea that they might go to jail for it is so far from their -LRB- abusers' -RRB- thinking that it's not a very effective deterrent,'' agreed <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Finkelhor </PERSON>, an expert in domestic violence and a professor of family research at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION>. Instead, <PERSON> Krugman </PERSON> and others said, the trial should highlight the urgent need for prevention. `` I have n't been impressed that there's been an enormous effort to do something about prevention and treatment of abused children in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> _ before or after <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Krugman </PERSON>. `` You could prevent 500 serious cases of abuse'' with the money spent prosecuting <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Krugman </PERSON>. `` That would be a living memorial to her _ to have a prevention program in her name.'' Dr. <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Fontana </PERSON>, director of the Mayor's <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> on Child Abuse, said the social system is riddled with problems. `` Child protective agencies are understaffed, overloaded and poorly supervised. People are leaving agencies after they've been trained because of demoralized attitudes,'' he said. Child abuse deaths number two to three a week in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and about 4,000 to 5,000 a year nationwide, said <PERSON> Fontana </PERSON>. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> had illegally gained custody of <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> and a baby boy from their unwed, teen-age mothers. Despite the family's supposed affluence _ <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> was an attorney, now disbarred, and his companion <PERSON> Hedda </PERSON> <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> was a children's book editor _ <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> slept on a sofa and looked increasingly dirty and unkempt. A school photographer testified that he used makeup and lighting tricks to camouflage bruises. Neighbors and a teacher also noticed injuries. A child abuse caseworker had visited the <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> home in 1984. Less than a month before <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'s death, police found Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> with a swollen lip, but she refused to press charges. Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> later testified for the prosecution about a 12-year relationship in which she was beaten, brainwashed and subjected to other bizarre punishments for transgressions imagined by a cocaine-using <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fontana </PERSON> charged that Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, although `` physically damaged and perhaps mentally damaged, could have certainly saved the child'' before the abuse escalated. `` That does n't excuse the school system, does n't excuse the police, does n't excuse the child protective agency, does n't excuse the community. There were friends, relatives, neighbors who knew what was going on and no one did anything,'' he said. Still, some good could emerge from the tragedy. State senators introduced 11 new bills Tuesday to toughen penalties for child abuse. <PERSON> Fontana </PERSON> is pressing the mayor for a special agency `` that will prioritize child abuse and neglect.'' He also suggested that schools, hospitals and social service agencies have access to a computerized data bank to judge whether a child is at risk. Meanwhile, the trial has shown that abuse occurs in all walks of life, said <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Daro </PERSON>, director of research for the Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prevention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION>. `` <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s legacy is that the middle-income people have been able to identify with child abuse,'' echoed <PERSON> Fontana </PERSON>. Dr. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Klagsbrun </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>'s psychiatrist at <ORGANIZATION> Four </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Winds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Katonah </LOCATION>, said the case has made a difference in two ways: by heightening awareness of domestic abuse and by proving that `` a severely battered woman, with significant treatment, can come back to life. ... That's the most hopeful part for women who are battered and watching this story.'' `` The real question is, what shape will this experience take down the line?'' said <PERSON> Klagsbrun </PERSON>. `` ... Will people learn something from it _ or is it just another sensational story which disappears? `` I think this is such a powerful story that it wo n't be forgotten.''

 Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, on a mission to encourage democracy in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, will meet with <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvador </ORGANIZATION>'s outgoing president and representatives of rightwing factions but not with anyone from the leftist party battling for power in the upcoming election, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said Tuesday <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s stop in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> on Friday will include meetings with President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> and members of his <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> as well as with representatives of the rightist <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, or ARENA, and `` a very diversified group of people,'' said a senior <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration official. But <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> will not meet with leftist presidential candidate <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ungo </PERSON> or members of his <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convergence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, those officials said. The officials, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s schedule should not be read as a sign the administration is taking sides in the March 19 election or is signalling any rejection of the recent truce proposal put forward by the guerrilla coalition allied with <PERSON> Ungo </PERSON>'s party. The explanation the officials offered for <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s willingness to meet with candidates of two political parties but not the third was that `` it would send the wrong signal at this point, given the delicacy of the internal situation. ... We want to go down there and see what the major parties have to say.'' Another <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official knowledgeable about relations with <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> said it would be awkward for <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> to meet with a civilian ally of rebels fighting to overthrow the U.S.-backed government. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s three-day journey _ with a stop in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> on Thursday for the inauguration of that country's new president, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> _ is being characterized as a chance for the vice president to get acquainted with Latin leaders, hear their concerns on such issues as the debt crisis and regional strife, and show <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for Latin democracies. One official who briefed reporters said the trip would also bolster <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s statements that he will be a top adviser to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The vice president `` will be privy to information that no one else has right now,'' and will relay it to the president, the official said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s policies on such matters as Latin American debt and the regional peace process are under review; <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is not expected to offer major policy initiatives. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s office has not released the names of the heads of state with whom he will meet in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, saying the plans are not yet final. But a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official involved in planning the trip said he is scheduled to meet with the presidents of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. He will also meet with a group of <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> leaders. One of the topics for those meetings will be the plight of the U.S.-backed <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> rebels battling the leftist government of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, the focus of discussions will be human rights. An administration official said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> intends to `` have very good, substantive, specific conversations, very straightforward,'' to emphasize that the administration is serious about adherence to human rights. Officials have expressed concern that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will balk at further aid to the strife-torn nation if its government does not reign in human rights abuses. <PERSON> Ungo </PERSON>'s party is a political ally of the umbrella <ORGANIZATION> Faribundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, which has been fighting the government since 1979. On Jan. 23, the guerrillas offered for the first time to participate in elections, but only if the ballotting is postponed until September. Opinion polls have shown ARENA's candidate, <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, leading Christian Democrat <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON>, with <PERSON> Ungo </PERSON> trailing.

 Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said Tuesday that six task forces are being created in major cities to combat `` crime in the suites'' by fighting against securities and commodities fraud. `` We see every year billions of dollars of losses to investors and in tax revenues to the federal government by reason of schemes involving deceit, concealment and breach of trust carried out, for example, in the securities and commodities businesses,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> told reporters. The attorney general, flanked by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, announced plans to create six securities and commodities fraud units in those cities as well as <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. The announcement came just weeks after disclosure that federal investigators in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> had been conducting a two-year undercover operation that has turned up widespread evidence of fraud by commodities futures traders at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said 15 federal prosecutors with experience investigating insider trading, stock manipulation and other sophisticated financial crimes would be assigned to work exclusively in this area along with law enforcement agents. The units will `` combat what can aptly be called crime in the suites,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said, `` the kind of criminal activity that's carried out under the guise of respectability in the major financial markets. `` All of these investigations are difficult and require the sophisticated efforts of experienced prosecutors. They are not made by breaking down the door and seizing the evidence,'' said <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, himself a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. The task force idea was first pressed in 1987 by federal prosecutors, including <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, the outgoing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> who spearheaded the successful prosecution of insider trading on Wall Street. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> hinted that the creation of task forces in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> would result in criminal indictments. `` Stay tuned,'' the attorney general told reporters. Selection of those cities for task forces was based on `` what the history had been, what the pending investigation caseload was,'' he said. `` The problem is bad enough that we want to undertake some extra steps to deal with it,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. `` The record speaks for itself in the prosecutions that have been undertaken ... to indicate we want to bring this additional firepower to bear on behalf of investors who otherwise might run the risk of being defrauded and might lose their confidence in the integrity of these markets,'' he said. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> defended <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON>, who has been accused by defense attorneys of using `` strong-arm'' tactics to pressure commodities traders into cooperating with the investigation. `` Mr. <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> has kept the department fully apprised of any significant investigations that he has undertaken and they have been approved at the appropriate levels,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. The attorney general said the 15 new positions would be taken from extra slots in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys offices provided for in the new drug bill and other legislation. The experienced prosecutors would be replaced with new hires, he said. Another 15 investigators and some clerical support staffers would be assigned to the task forces, which would number between 30 and 40 people, department officials said. Agents from the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Postal Service, the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, would also be permanently assigned to the task forces.

 A military tanker plane carrying 19 people crashed today on takeoff at <ORGANIZATION> Dyess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, killing at least 16 people, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said. The KC-135A tanker crashed in a ball of flame near the south end of a runway, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officials said. The wreckage scattered over a wide area and still burned more than an hour after the crash. Airman 1st Class <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrell </PERSON>, speaking from <LOCATION> Dyess </LOCATION>, said at least 16 people were killed. The plane's crew `` never got it off the ground,'' said <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, 19, who was on his way home when he saw the crash. `` The first thing I saw was just the mushroom of the smoke. ... I thought was they were having a fire drill,'' he said. `` I heard the plane as it was coming down,'' said <PERSON> Skeet </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` Engines were backfiring and missing. It curved off to the left and crashed. And then I saw the ball of smoke and fire go up.'' The plane, assigned to K.I. <ORGANIZATION> Sawyer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, was en route from <LOCATION> Dyess </LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Hickam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> on a training mission, said <PERSON> Dyess </PERSON> <PERSON> Airman </PERSON> 1st Class Beverly Foster. The KS-135, dubbed the Stratotanker, is the backbone of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s refueling fleet. The four-engine jet, a military spin-off of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 707, normally takes a crew of four or five but can carry more passengers even when carrying fuel. A KC-135 crashed Oct. 11, 1988, at Wurtsmith Air Base near <LOCATION> Oscoda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich </LOCATION>. The plane, also from K.I. <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, crashed and burst into flames on landing. The crash killed six and injured 10 aboard.

<TEXT>
 Deeply split factions in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> quarreled for the second day at a key meeting Tuesday, and the military issued new warnings that it will intervene if the crisis continues The meeting also was told that the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> will discuss demands for the ouster of national party chief <PERSON> Stipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON>, but that the 23-member Politburo, the most powerful party body, will make a final decision. <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON> took the floor to announce that if the Politburo decides to relieve him, `` I shall accept this only as a moral reprimand because the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> alone can decide on an ideological-political measure,'' such as dismissing him. His comments suggest there is disagreement even on the rules and procedure for a possible dismissal. The meeting of the policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which started Monday, is marked by a rift between liberals and conservatives over ways to overcome the country's worst economic and political crisis. As opposing delegates clashed, two senior military officers issued dramatic warnings that the armed forces would not remain idle if the country's fortunes continue to decline. `` One of the biggest barriers to the stabilization of the situation in the country is the disunity of the leaderships on all levels,'' said Vice Adm. <PERSON> Stane </PERSON> <PERSON> Brovet </PERSON>, the deputy defense minister. `` <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> can survive only as a true federation, and the forces which are striving toward the breakup of such a <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> should be prevented primarily by political, but also by all other means,'' <PERSON> Brovet </PERSON> said. The military has remained on the sidelines of recent political conflicts between those favoring more democracy and political pluralism and those advocating a strong, centralized communist system to solve the country's problems. Senior officers show signs of increasing unease over the crisis, which includes a 250 percent inflation rate, a sharp drop in living standards and an alarming increase in labor and ethnic unrest. The political chief of the armed forces, Adm. <PERSON> Petar </PERSON> <PERSON> Simic </PERSON>, told the meeting Monday: `` What some describe as the battle for <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> will not be waged without the Yugoslav army.'' Both military men have called for an end to the feuding. But supporters of <PERSON> Slobodan </PERSON> <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>, the hard-line party chief of the Serbian republic, continued attacks on Suvar, a Croat, and other non-Serbian federal officials whom they blame for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s protracted crisis Croatian <PERSON> Ivo </PERSON> <PERSON> Druzic </PERSON> sparked a sharp debate when he appealed to <LOCATION> Suvar </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> to reconcile their differences and compromise. Druzic compared their clash to `` a train being pulled in opposite directions by two locomotives.'' <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> rejected this assertion without indicating any willingness to compromise. <PERSON> Vukasin </PERSON> <PERSON> Micunovic </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> member from <LOCATION> Montenegro </LOCATION>, said, `` The intolerance shown at this meeting ... is a result of the struggle for power'' under way in the party leadership. <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>'s supporters at the session criticized <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON>'s opening speech Monday, when he said the country faces a stark choice between more democracy or `` neo-Stalinism.'' `` Yesterday's speech, without a trace of self-criticism ... does not offer answers to any of the key questions,'' said Serbian member <PERSON> Tomislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Radovic </PERSON>. <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> is supported by <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s poorer regions, which fear that market-oriented economic reforms will cause layoffs at loss-making, state-subsidized enterprises. Suvar is supported by <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> and his native <LOCATION> Croatia </LOCATION>, which favor increased political pluralism, more democracy and radical market-oriented reforms.

 <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> called President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` a very good and old friend'' Tuesday and said the two have only minor differences concerning the conduct of economic policy. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> played down reports of a rift between the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> which surfaced last week after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in an interview he did not believe the central bank should be trying to slow economic growth because of a fear of inflation. `` Whatever differences do exist _ and I think they are minuscule _ have been exaggerated,'' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said during an appearance before the congressional <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. In an interview, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had cautioned the central bank against overreacting to the threat of inflation following testimony the previous day by <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> in which the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> chairman said the risk of higher inflation was serious enough that <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> policy should err more on the side of `` restrictiveness than of stimulus.'' In his comments, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I do n't want to see us move so strongly against fear of inflation that we impede growth.'' On Friday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said during a press conference he did n't believe the differences between the new administration and the central bank were that great. Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarbannes </PERSON>, D-Md., said he was concerned that disagreements between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> were being aired publicly rather than being worked out in private He questioned <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> about his access to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the role he has had in making suggestions on what should be in the budget <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will submit to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> next month. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said he had not met with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> since December but that he was meeting on a regular basis with <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s top economic spokesman. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said he expects to be consulted on the contents of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s budget before the president unveils it in a joint address to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Feb. 9. `` I have no problem communicating with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. He is a very good and old friend of mine,'' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said. `` I am not the least bit concerned about what is going on. I think the press is trying to make this a cause celeb where none exists.'' Many private economists have said the new administration, which needs robust economic growth to drive the budget deficit down, could be on a collision course with the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>, which since last March has been pushing interest rates higher in an effort to slow the economy and keep inflation from getting out of hand. In his comments Tuesday, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> sought to minimize any differences he might have with the new administration. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said the economic predictions used by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to construct its final budget were optimistic but were `` well within the range of reasonableness,'' especially if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration agree on significant spending cuts that will meet the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction targets. Those targets call for reducing an expected $ 161 billion deficit this year to $ 100 billion in the fiscal year which begins Oct. 1. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> budget director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> has indicated the new administration will base its own budget revisions on the optimistic forecasts contained in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> budget. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said that while he expects that the current economic recovery, which has lasted a peacetime record of six years, will some day end in a new recession, he said the imbalances that normally preceded a downturn were not now in evidence. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said that rather than pushing the economy into another downturn, he believes the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts to boost interest rates would extend the length of the recovery by keeping inflationary forces under control. On another matter, <PERSON> Greepspan </PERSON> said the huge <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit, which has shown little improvement over the past six months, would begin improving again this year without the need for a further drop in the value of the dollar.

 The leaders of war-scarred <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> have begun to reshuffle their nation's Cabinet, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s state-run news agency said Tuesday. <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which acts as a collective presidency, decided to remove seven ministers, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. It said Prime Minister <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> was expected to form a new government within 24 hours. The decision has not been officially announced in <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>. Among those affected was <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Turabi </PERSON>, minister of justice and head of the fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. He has been at the center of a debate over a tentative agreement for peace with southern rebels. <PERSON> Turabi </PERSON>, who opposed suspending Islamic law as part of a pact with rebels in the heavily Christian south, is expected to become foreign minister, the Egyptian report said. The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unionist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, a member of the governing coalition in <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, signed the peace agreement with the rebel <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in November. But it withdrew from the coalition when <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> refused to present the agreement to the government, apparently to avoid angering <PERSON> Turabi </PERSON>'s party. <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> is now expected to select ministers from groups including his <ORGANIZATION> Umma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, and southern parties, according to the Egyptian report. Since he came to power by general elections in April 1986, <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> has reshuffled his Cabinet three times. <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> has been shaken by chronic food shortages. Protests over food prices broke out in December and killed four people. The Sudanese also suffer from severe hunger and face a $ 14 billion foreign debt.

 Officials are trying to speed up the opening of the nation's fourth oil refinery because of shortages created by a fire at a nearby facility. The Jan. 24 blaze killed five people and destroyed a facility that had been producing 60,000 barrels a day. The cause of the fire was not known. Although the government diverted oil supplies from the north, long lines formed at gasoline stations in several cities in the heart of the oil-producing region. The fourth refinery, built to handle 200,000 barrels of petroleum daily, was scheduled to open March 16. The government set up a task force to speed up the opening of the new refinery. <PERSON> Aret </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, managing director of the <ORGANIZATION> Nigerian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said replacing the destroyed refinery would cost $ 300 million. It was opened in 1965 by British Petroleum. Production from the new $ 850 million refinery had been scheduled to go to overseas markets. Until the lost production capacity is replaced, however, about half of it will be sold in <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> or neighboring countries.

Similar systems are functioning at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>'s Main airports and have been recommended by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> to guide airplanes and ground equipment in bad weather. The $ 600,000 cost of the system was shared by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, which operates the airport. The system is being tested at 15 of the most critical intersections where taxiways cross runways. In all, there are about 75 places where taxiways cross runways, <ORGANIZATION> Gartner </ORGANIZATION> said. The need for such a system has been underscored by the increasing number of ground collisions at airports around the world. The worst such collision occurred in 1977 at <LOCATION> Tenerife </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Canary </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> and killed 583 people. The traffic lights are radio controlled from the tower, said <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pardue </PERSON>. In the tower, a person called the local controller instructs all aircraft on the ground. With the new system, a second controller monitors conversations between the local controller and the pilots and operates the red and green lights accordingly. `` It will remove a chance for error where the pilot and the controller do not understand each other, or do n't communicate for some reason, or where the pilot hears clearance for a plane that he think is his, but is n't,'' <PERSON> Pardue </PERSON> said. `` Voice control will still govern, however. If the light is red, the pilot has to ask about it,'' <PERSON> Pardue </PERSON> said. He said it was too early to say whether the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> would eventually mandate such systems as busy airports.

 With little more than 1,370 days until the next presidential election, the <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> have a front-runner to challenge President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. According to the first 1992 campaign poll, the leader is Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. The mid-January <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> survey, which an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> polling analyst termed `` just a fun read on what people think,'' underscored the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> senator's standing as the most familiar name among Democrats. `` As my family keeps reminding me, I've been elected president 73 times in the past 20 years in polls like this,'' quipped the senator. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> emerged as the top 1992 presidential choice among Democrats or independents leaning Democratic. `` You're kidding,'' said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohut </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Gallup </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, when told of the poll. `` At this point, premature understates the case by a lot,'' said <PERSON> Kohut </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanley </PERSON>, a polling analyst at <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, said the survey was `` just a fun read on what people think and we found <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> at the top, which we've found in the past never turns out to be true.'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> is familiar with the role of early front-runner. In July 1985, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> held a 15-point lead over <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> in a Gallup poll measuring Democrats' preferences for the 1988 presidential nomination. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> remained the front-runner through Dec. 19, 1985, the day he announced he would not run for president. In the new survey, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was the choice of 26 percent of people shown a list of seven prominent Democrats and asked `` which of the following persons do you think would be the best candidate for the Democrats to run in 1992.'' Ms. <PERSON> Hanley </PERSON> said the survey was done because `` we were interested in seeing what type of support <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had at the moment.'' The 1988 Democratic presidential nominee has announced he will not seek another term as governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, but has refused to rule out a 1992 presidential run. The <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> poll had him tied for third place with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. In second place was Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The top four finishers in the survey were bona fide <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> liberals, a political species supposedly headed for the endangered list after landslide defeats in the last three presidential elections. Trailing the four leaders were Sens. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> polled 781 people who described themselves as Democrats or independents who lean toward favoring Democrats. They were contacted between Jan. 12 and 16 and the results had a 4-point margin of error, meaning they could be off as much as four percentage points up or down. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was the first choice of 26 percent and <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> of 19 percent. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> were named by 15 percent each, while <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> had 6 percent, <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> 5 and <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> 4. One prominent Democrat not included on the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> list was <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> who received highly favorable reviews as the party's vice presidential candidate in 1988.

 <PERSON> Natan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON>, Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s choice to represent <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, is a short, balding man who spent nine years in Soviet prisons but seems never to lose his sense of humor `` I will say only what I want to say. I have enough experience with interrogations and I know how to give answers,'' <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON>, 41, told a radio interviewer who pressed him to comment on the reported appointment. In the early 1970s, <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON>, a mathematician by profession, was a member of a human rights watchdog organization headed by physicist <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, a Nobel Prize laureate. <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> gained prominence as a spokesman for the group. He had wide contacts with foreign journalists in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and emerged as a champion of the Soviet Jewry emigration movement. <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> married in 1974. A day after the wedding, his wife, <PERSON> Avital </PERSON>, left for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, hoping that he would soon follow. But <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> was denied exit visa. In March 1977, he was arrested and in 1978 convicted of espionage and sentenced to 13 years in prison. He spent nine years in Soviet prisons and labor camps and became a symbol of the Soviet Jews' plight, thanks to the efforts of <PERSON> Avital </PERSON>, who tirelessy campaigned on his behalf in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. Freedom came on Feb. 11, 1986, when <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> was released in a dramatic East-West spy swap on <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s Glienicke Bridge. In <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> first kept a low profile, devoting himself to family life. He and <PERSON> Avital </PERSON> now have two daughters, 2-year-old <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hannah </PERSON>, born in November. <PERSON> Avital </PERSON> became an observant Jew during the years of <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON>'s forced absence, but <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> has defines himself as non-religious Newspapers have speculated the marriage may fail apart because of religious differences. <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON>, for whom unity is a prime value, responded angrily to the reports. `` I feel like my own bald pate has been conscripted into <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s Kulturkampf,'' or culture war, he said in a recent interview `` People here concentrate too much on their differences ... instead of principles and common aims.'' <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> has successfully defeated attempts by many of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s parties to lure him into their political embrace But besieged by his former compatriots, he emerged last year to found a lobby group that seeks to improve conditions for thousands of Soviet immigrants plagued by shortages in jobs and housing. Unity, again, was the key, and Soviet Jewry activists said only <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> could unite about 10 groups representing the immigrants.

 If the city of such hostelries as the Waldorf, the <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> and the Plaza does n't have enough truly first-class hotel rooms, architect I.M. <PERSON> Pei </PERSON> has a solution: a 50-story hotel where singles start at about $ 400 a night. `` It's an expensive piece of property, it's going to be expensive to build, and it's going to be expensive as hell to live in,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> of Regent Hotels, which will run the Regent of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said Tuesday at a news conference. The 400-room hotel, which will be on 57th Street in the heart of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, is to open in 1991. It is expected to cost $ 300 million, according to the developer, <ORGANIZATION> EIE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said nightly rates would be nearly $ 400 to $ 700 for suites. The developers say some international travelers, especially business people on expense accounts, already are paying as much as $ 400 a night in many of the world's largest cities, and will happily do the same in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pei </PERSON>'s design calls for a tower of honey-colored limestone that steps back gradually from its base, rising to a crown marked by four lanterns. The Regent's 600-square-foot standard room will be the size of many one-bedroom apartments in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, and about 40 percent larger than the average <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> hotel room, its developers said. According to a Regent Hotels description, each room will feature walk-in closets, separate dressing areas, three telephones and two telephone lines, two or three color television sets, connections for computers and fax machines, and a videocassette recorder and compact disc player. In a touch borrowed from <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> _ Regent is based in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> _ each floor, even upper ones with as few as six rooms, will have a steward to attend to guests' needs. According to a news release, these might include `` having a button sewn, flowers delivered, a limousine ordered.'' The most expensive hotel in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> is probably the Plaza Athenee on the upper <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>, where single rooms cost about $ 300. Others, according to the Convention and <ORGANIZATION> Visitors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, include the <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> at $ 250 - $ 340; the Plaza at $ 215 - $ 290, or $ 450 for a Central Park view; and the <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> $ 210 - Relative bargains include the Hilton at $ 155 - $ 200, the <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marquis </ORGANIZATION> at $ 210 - $ 235 and the <LOCATION> Waldorf-Astoria </LOCATION> at $ 180 - Business has been good, with an occupancy rate of about 76 percent, 10 percentage points higher than the national average, according to the bureau. But, as staffer <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Astrom </PERSON> noted, `` now things are going to spread out.'' Several luxury hotels have opened in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> in the past year, and six more are under construction.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday awarded a $ 459.4 million contract to <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, combining in one fixed-price contract its fiscal 1989 order for HARM missiles along with those of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, in a brief announcement, said it was buying 2,449 High-Speed Anti-Radiation Missiles, or HARMs, from <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION> this year. That combines an order for 1,319 for itself, 950 for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and 180 for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said. The sale to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, worth $ 35.2 million, is the first-ever foreign sale of the weapon.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday announced new restrictions on savings institutions' investments in so-called `` junk bonds,'' which pay high interest rates but carry more risk than investment-grade bonds. The agency, which regulates about 3,000 federally insured S & amp; Ls, barred insolvent institutions from making new investments in junk bonds and generally will require them to sell junk bonds they already own. Exceptions to the rule are permitted if bank board examiners believe holding the junk bonds is in the near-term interest of the government insurance fund backing S & amp; L deposits. Solvent, but shaky, institutions that do n't meet capital requirements will be required to get government approval before buying junk bonds. Existing regulations permit the purchase of junk bonds, but institutions can invest no more than 5 percent of their portfolios in a single junk bond mutual fund. Over the last several years, junk bonds have been a profitable investment for many S & amp; Ls. Analysts worry, however, that if the issuing companies default during an economic downturn, S & amp; Ls will be stuck for a loss. At the end of last June, junk bonds accounted for $ 13 billion, or 1 percent, of the industry's $ 1.29 trillion in assets, the bank board said.

<TEXT>
 Prices farmers get for raw products began 1989 with a 1.4 percent increase from December to January and were up 12 percent from a year ago, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. The department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said in its first price report of the year that higher prices for cattle, hogs, tomatoes and wheat were partly offset by lower prices for strawberries, grapefruit, peanuts and oranges. New quarterly figures showed prices paid by farmers to meet expenses rose 1.2 percent from October and averaged 6.1 percent more than a year ago. Higher prices for feeder stock, including pigs and cattle, along with higher calf prices accounted for most of the rise since last fall. In a related report, the board said preliminary figures showed last year's corn production, which was shriveled nearly a third by drought and heat, had a value of more than $ 13 billion, an average of $ 2.60 per bushel. That was down from almost $ 14 billion in 1987, when the crop averaged only $ 1.94 per bushel. The value is <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s estimate of how much a crop is worth, whether a farmer sells it for cash or feeds it to livestock. Soybeans were valued at almost $ 11.9 billion, an average of $ 7.70 per bushel, compared with $ 11.3 billion and $ 5.88 in 1987. Wheat was third at $ 6.63 billion and $ 3.70 per bushel, compared with a 1987 value of $ 5.5 billion and $ 2.57 per bushel. According to the preliminary January price figures, based mostly on midmonth averages, the index for livestock and livestock products as a group rose 1.9 percent from their December average and were up 6.8 percent from January 1988. The department's all-crops price index for January rose 0.7 percent from December and was up 20 percent from a year earlier. Prices of food grains were up 3.2 percent from December. Wheat prices rose 14 cents per bushel from December to $ 4.08 in January, the highest since March 1981. Rice dropped 8 cents per 100 pounds to $ 6.52 per hundredweight. Prices of commercial vegetables rose 8.2 percent from December, with tomatoes and sweet corn leading the increase. The all-fruit price index dropped 6.8 percent from December but still averaged 16.2 percent more than in January 1988. Oranges dropped to $ 6.20 per box from $ 6.50 in December but were up from $ 5.64 a year earlier. <PERSON> Grapefruit </PERSON> declined to $ 3.72 per box from $ 4.71 in December and $ 5.63 in January 1988. Although the projections are subject to change, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> economists say that net cash income of farmers may be in the range of $ 48 billion to $ 58 billion this year, compared with a near-record of $ 57 billion in 1988. That is the difference between cash receipts and cash expenses during the calendar year. Department economists say cash expenses are expected to rise moderately in 1989 with expanded crop acreages and costlier production items. Food prices in 1988 rose an average of about 3.7 percent, and <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> analysts say another increase of 3 percent to 5 percent is likely in 1989. The report said: _ Cattle averaged $ 69.30 per 100 pounds of live weight nationally, up from $ 67.20 in December and $ 65.40 in January 1988 Those are averages for all types of cattle sold as beef. _ Hogs averaged $ 41.70 per 100 pounds, compared with $ 39.70 in December and $ 43 a year earlier _ Corn, at $ 2.58 a bushel, was up from $ 2.53 in December and $ 1.77 in January 1988 _ Wheat prices at the farm, according to preliminary figures, averaged $ 4.08 per bushel, compared with $ 3.94 in December and $ 2.75 a year earlier _ Rice averaged $ 6.52 per 100 pounds, down from $ 6.60 in December and $ 7.93 a year earlier _ Soybeans were $ 7.64 per bushel, compared with $ 7.53 in December and $ 5.73 a year earlier _ Upland cotton was reported at 54.2 cents per pound, down from 55.3 cents in December and 61.7 cents in January 1988 _ Eggs were 63.7 cents per dozen, compared with 59.7 cents in December and 49.3 cents a year earlier _ Milk was $ 13.40 per 100 pounds, compared with $ 13.50 in December and $ 12.50 a year earlier _ Broilers were 35.3 cents per pound, live weight, compared with 35.5 cents in December and 27.1 cents a year ago

<HEAD>Administration To Propose Package Of Tax Breaks In Revised Budget</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will propose a round of tax breaks reflecting campaign promises in its Feb. 9 budget rewrite, but disagreement has surfaced over a major component, a reduction in the capital gains tax, officials said Tuesday. Administration budget writers have not reached a consensus on whether the lower rates urged by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> during his campaign should apply equally to the sale of homes, stocks and other assets, said sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Treasury officials hope to minimize any adverse effect on the budget deficit that might result from lowering the tax on certain assets, such as private real estate and art objects. Sources said it is likely that the budget plan <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> unveils at the time of his address to a joint session of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> next week also will include: _ A child-care tax credit of up to $ 1,000 per child that would be available to low-income families, generally those earning less than $ 10,000 a year _ New tax incentives for oil and gas exploration, likely coupled with a call for removal of remaining price controls on natural gas, now affecting about 40 percent of production _ A proposal for tax-free `` enterprise zones'' to be established in some inner city areas to promote commercial growth, a program championed on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s nominee for Housing and <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> secretary, former Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N </LOCATION> In addition, administration officials are still wrestling with terms of a package to help bail out troubled savings and loan institutions, and it appeared likely that some variation on a proposal for an increased fee for deposit insurance would be part of the new <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> budget plan. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said even before he took office that his campaign vow to propose a reduction in capital gains tax rates would be part of the budget revisions he makes to the $ 1.15 trillion spending plan for fiscal year 1990 that former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> submitted Jan. 9. And <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> reiterated his support for such a plan in a news conference last Friday. However, sources say there is still disagreement over exactly what form the tax cut should take. Capital gains _ profits from the sale of real estate, stocks and other assets _ are currently taxed at the same level as other income, at 15 percent, 28 percent or 33 percent, depending on overall income. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would lower the rate to a maximum of 15 percent. He claims that such a move would be an incentive to investment, generating up to $ 4 billion a year in new revenues. However, many leading economists, including the bipartisan <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, argue that lowering the tax would have the opposite effect _ reducing revenues and further worsening the budget deficit. To make sure the proposal does have the potential for spurring investment, administration budget writers are trying to fine-tune it. For instance, while it could be argued that a lower capital gains rate for the sale of coprorate stocks and commercial properties might spur additional investment, it might be more difficult to argue the same for the sale of private homes and objects of art, analysts suggest. The package of tax breaks to be included in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s budget plan all reflect promises he made during last year's presidential campaign. However, White House officials say it seems unlikely that all of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s promises will make it into the document _ budget constraints being what they are. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> must propose a plan that will get the federal budget deficit, currently hovering at about $ 150 billion, down to below the Gramm-Rudman target of $ 100 billion for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. And, he has repeatedly vowed, he will do it without proposing new taxes. `` Obviously we'll be setting priorities. I think you'll see education, environmennt, child care,'' said a senior White House official, insisting on anonmymity. On education, the official said the budget plan would highlight `` a few guiding principles,'' such as excellence and achievement and accountability and choice of schools. However, some of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign promises on education _ including a $ 500 million National Merit scholarship program, an expansion of the Head Start program and a $ 50 million increase in school experimentation _ may be considerably pruned back, sources said. The sources also said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign proposal to expand Medicaid coverage to more lower-income Americans and to allow low-paid workers to purchase it was being given a low priority in budget preparation talks. `` There's no question <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants to make this a kinder, gentler nation. But he also wants to reduce the federal deficit. The two have to be reconciled,'' said the senior White House official.

<HEAD>Judge Says He'll Probably Let INS Restrict Travel Of Asylum Applicants</HEAD>

 A federal judge said Tuesday he probably will allow the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to return to a policy of restricting political asylum applicants to southern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> pending reviews. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Filemon </PERSON> <PERSON> Vela </PERSON> extended until Feb. 20 an order blocking the procedure, but added: `` At that time, unless I'm persuaded otherwise, the restraining order will be lifted. `` We're pleased with the results,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON>, associate general counsel for the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION>, who traveled from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for Tuesday's hearing. `` The judge was fair.'' <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> critics cited a sharp increase in homeless Central Americans living in squalid conditions in the area after the procedure took effect Dec. 16. A group of immigration attorneys sued the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> over the matter here on Jan. 6, and on Jan. 9 <PERSON> Vela </PERSON> issued a temporary restraining order blocking the procedure. Under the procedure, the district began requiring asylum applicants to file their claims in <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION> and await decisions there in 30 days, a period in which they were not allowed to work. The most visible effect of the travel restriction was a rugged campsite east of <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, where more than 300 Central Americans camped out on the ground under discarded cardboard and sheets of plastic. Huge case backlogs in cities such as <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> made it necessary to keep the immigrants near their points of entry while the government sorted out thousands of unfounded asylum claims, the government maintains. The only issue <PERSON> Vela </PERSON> agreed to consider in the class-action lawsuit, on behalf of Central Americans and other asylum-seekers in the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION>' <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION>, was whether the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> instituted the change without allowing time for public comment as required in the federal Administrative Procedures Act. `` I am somewhat inclined to believe that probably what was taking place here would not require a notice and comment ... was more procedural than substantive,'' <PERSON> Vela </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>, one of the attorneys suing the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION>, said the plaintiffs still hope the judge will rule against the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> after a closer examination of the suit. `` The judge certainly indicated that he was not happy with the situation as it existed, and strongly admonished the government that he would be concerned if conditions ever returned to the state that existed prior to his issuance of a temporary restraining order,'' said <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>, with the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>. Before Dec. 16, the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> allowed asylum-seekers who voluntarily presented themselves to the <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> to travel on to their <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> destinations, where they often were allowed to work while pursuing their claims for refugee status. Hundreds of Central Americans left the area on northbound buses and other vehicles after <PERSON> Vela </PERSON> made it possible for them to travel again Jan. 9. Many headed for <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. But officials from the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> area visited southern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to tell the refugees they had no shelter for them, and joined officials in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> in calling on the federal government for help. <PERSON> Vela </PERSON> said he was concerned with past asylum statistics showing that, of the thousands who traveled into the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interior, 75 percent never showed up at <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> offices to legally pursue their cases. More than 30,000 Central Americans, about half of them from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, passed through the <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> in 1988, most having crossed the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> illegally in the vicinity of the border city of <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>DA Won't Oppose New Trial For `Thin Blue Line' Prisoner</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The man whose conviction for killing a police officer was questioned in the movie `` The Thin Blue Line'' has gotten the backing of the district attorney in his quest for a new trial. A brief filed by District Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vance </PERSON>'s office in the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> on Monday said perjured testimony may have tainted the conviction of <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> for the 1976 slaying of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>. <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> said, however, he still believes <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> is guilty of the murder. The officer was shot at least five times during a traffic stop. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, 40, has spent 12 years in prison, consistently maintaining his innocence. A key witness changed his testimony last month and said <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> was n't even in the car stopped by <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>. A judge ruled <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> did not get a fair trial and should either be granted another or set free. Evidence has surfaced that at least four other trial witnesses lied, authorities have said. Last fall, the documentary `` The Thin Blue Line'' examined the case. In the brief filed with the appeals court, <PERSON> Vance </PERSON>'s office said it `` has no objection to ... the finding that -LRB- <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> -RRB- is entitled to a new trial.'' District Court Judge <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Baraka </PERSON>, who heard three days of testimony in December, concluded <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> was probably innocent, that key witnesses had committed perjury and that former Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulder </PERSON> suppressed crucial evidence that might have cleared him. <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> he had not read the brief his office filed, he had instructed assistant prosecutors to send it to the appeals court if they felt the evidence supported <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' claims. `` I told them to do whatever was right on the thing. If that's the way it was, that's the way it was,'' said <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> The prosecutor said that if <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> is granted a new trial, he will try to charge <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> again. `` It's obviously a radical shift in their position,'' said defense lawyer <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaffer </PERSON>. `` At least on the surface, it appears they're doing the honorable thing.'' He added he plans to use <PERSON> Vance </PERSON>'s brief in his efforts to persuade the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pardons </ORGANIZATION> and Paroles to free <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> while the appeals court considers the case.

<HEAD>Brady Testifies on Buyout Tax Law Changes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> gave a qualified endorsement Tuesday to limiting tax deductions for interest payments on debt incurred in leveraged buyouts, if the resulting revenue were used to reduce taxes on stock dividends. `` If you're going to make a change _ and clearly we're not suggesting one _ we would suggest that you look in the area of perhaps limiting interest deductions and using that money to give a break to corporate owners of stock,'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Echoing his testimony last week before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration would prefer <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` wait a little'' to see if the trend of leveraged buyouts, which approached $ 100 billion in 1988, begins to diminish on its own. `` We have a habit of correcting things just as they are about to correct themselves,'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said. `` If we wait a little longer, this thing is not going to gobble us up. We ca n't prove at this point that the economy has been damaged.'' Congressional Democrats, however, made it clear they're under pressure to rein in junk-bond-financed corporate takeovers, particularly because insurance companies and other holders of long-term, investment-grade bonds are beginning to be hurt in the deals. For example, owners of some $ 5 billion in long-term bonds in <ORGANIZATION> RJR-Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, saw the value of those securities drop by a $ 1 billion to $ 4 billion almost overnight upon the announcement of its pending takeover by buyout specialist <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> last fall for $ 25 billion. `` I have a feeling that we're looking at a <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale that's showing zero and then we have an eruption of 7 or 8 on the scale and it's too late,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Downey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, using a major earthquake with widespread, heavy damage as a metaphor Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, D-Ill., the panel's chairman, said the outcry for congressional action has become deafening in the 16 months since then-Treasury Secretary and now Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> tried to blame the 1987 stock market crash on an attempt then to curb leveraged buyouts through tax law changes <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> agreed that the `` driving force'' behind the buyout phenomenon is that companies can avoid a 34 percent corporate income tax rate by raising their capital through debt rather than stock sales. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> also has been attempting to find a way through <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> regulations or a legislative proposal to make the tax treatment of stock-equity and bond-debt financing more equal, saying the buyout problem would disappear with a `` level playing field.'' `` So far we have n't been able to come up with one,'' he said, adding that the financial community's response to his appeals for suggestions has been `` disappointing.'' Rep. <PERSON> J.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, likened <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s qualified endorsement of reducing the tax deductibility of interest on junk bonds in exchange for a corporate tax credit on dividends to `` a kiss through a veil'' and criticized him for not coming up with specific suggestions.

<HEAD>Americans Last in Math, Below the Mean in Science in International
Survey</HEAD>

 American teen-agers scored dead last in math and well below the mean in science in an international survey whose results `` pose a serious challenge to our position in the world community,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Testing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> youngsters were outperformed in math by their counterparts in four other countries and four Canadian provinces and were among the worst science achievers in the assessment of 24,000 13-year-olds. `` The obvious conclusion is that unless we're careful, the <ORGANIZATION> Buck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> of the 1990s is going to be living in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, instead of <LOCATION> Chattanooga </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>,'' said former <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, now president of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION>. `` How many times must this nation be reminded of its educational deficit?'' Education Secretary <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> asked in a statement, referring to repeated findings that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> children perform poorly in math and science. <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> called the situation `` a national tragedy,'' while other educators termed the survey results frightening and devastating. <ORGANIZATION> ETS </ORGANIZATION> officials tried to put a less-pessimistic face on their findings, noting that almost all of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> teen-agers demonstrated mastery of basic math skills and knowledge of everyday science facts. `` We are making improvements on our own terms. We are educating every child in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Archie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lapointe </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> ETS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> for the Assessment of Educational Progress. `` Everyone is talking now about higher-order skills, higher standards. I'm very confident that this is going to happen,'' <PERSON> Lapointe </PERSON> added. `` If we articulate what we want to do, the schools will deliver.'' But <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION>, said elementary school teachers wo n't be able to deliver unless they are required to take math and science courses to qualify for their licenses. `` We've got a long way to go before we turn it around,'' <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON> said. `` The next generation of -LRB- elementary school -RRB- teachers has already been educated without math or science. You've got a terrible pipeline problem.'' The assessment, financed by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, was based on tests of students in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>. The last three were divided into <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> - and English-speaking samples Korean students demonstrated the highest overall mathematics achievement while those from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and French-speaking <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> showed the lowest. Youths in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> turned in the best science performance. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, along with <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and French-speaking <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION>, `` perform well below the mean,'' the report said. Among the specific findings: _ Seventy-eight percent of the Korean 13-year-olds can use intermediate mathematics skills to solve two-step problems such as computing the average age of five children That compares with only 40 percent in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and French-speaking <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>. The report called the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> performance `` a matter for grave concern.'' _ Forty percent of the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> students understand measurement and geometry concepts and can solve more complex problems, such as figuring out the radius of a circle That compares with under 10 percent in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and French-speaking <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>. _ Despite their poor performance, two-thirds of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> students said they considered themselves `` good at mathematics. Only 23 percent of Korean students, the highest achievers, shared that attitude. _ More than 70 percent of the youngsters in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> can use scientific procedures and analyze scientific data compared with only 35 percent to 40 percent in the four bottom nations and provinces `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has traditionally thought of itself as technologically innovative and in the forefront in science,'' the report said. `` These results are sobering and pose a serious challenge to our position in the world community.'' Many educators said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> performance could be improved if teachers and parents expected more of students and showed more enthusiasm themselves about science and math. And they said international comparisons are helpful in determining how high expectations should be.

 <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said at a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> meeting Tuesday that <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers have fired tear gas into hospitals and homes during the Palestinian uprising, causing up to 60 deaths. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> denied the charges. An envoy of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, in an apparent reference to the accusation, told the 43-nation meeting Palestinian children had died in `` Israeli gas chambers.'' Amnesty spokeswoman <PERSON> Ingrid </PERSON> <PERSON> Kircher </PERSON> read a statement saying the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> forces fired tear gas into hospitals and homes, a `` deliberate misuse'' because manufacturers' instructions say the gas can kill in confined places. She said about 60 people were reported to have died in tear gas-related incidents, `` some of them as a direct result of its misuse.'' <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON>, spokesman for Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, said in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>: `` It's all a great lie. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has certainly not shot into hospitals.'' An army spokesman said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> act `` in accordance with the international law and judicial procedures.'' The spokesman said on condition of anonymity that the army will provide a detailed response to the allegations after a `` careful study of the report.'' The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> observer, <PERSON> Nabil </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramlawi </PERSON>, made the reference to `` Israeli gas chambers'' in his remarks to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> meeting in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. Many of the 6 million Jews who died in the Nazi holocaust were killed in Nazi gas chambers. <PERSON> Ramlawi </PERSON> also accused the Israelis of beating pregnant women to cause them to miscarry, burying people alive to save ammunition instead of shooting them, and stealing organs from wounded <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> patients to be used in transplant operations on Israelis. The statement of London-based Amnesty expressed grave concern over what it called `` extensive human rights violations'' by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> despite growing domestic and international protests. It said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities `` appear so far to have condoned _ if not encouraged _ the excessive use of force.'' More than 365 Palestinians and 15 Israelis have died in the 13-month revolt. The Palestinians are protesting occupation by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, which seized the lands from neighboring Arab states in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. Amnesty said about 300 civilians have been shot to death by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers. The group's statement also said thousands of <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> _ including children, elderly people, and wounded patients _ have been `` forcibly removed from hospitals'' and beaten by Israeli army and security forces. It said at least eight of the victims died. Amnesty urged the Israeli government to crack down on excessive use of force and prosecute those guilty of abuses.

<HEAD>Former Commander of USS Pueblo Gives `More Frank Account' of 1968
Capture</HEAD>

 <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s capture of the USS Pueblo and its 83-man crew, who were held prisoner for 11 months in 1968, would not have occurred if the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> had acted properly, the ship's former commander said. `` The story of the <LOCATION> Pueblo </LOCATION>, in a nutshell, is one of a naval officer, his crew, and his ship, set to do a job; things went bad, and the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> abandoned them,'' retired Comm. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bucher </PERSON> said in a letter published this week in two naval magazines. In an interview Tuesday, <PERSON> Bucher </PERSON> said he was speaking out two decades later because `` I was still an emotional nervous wreck and I could not concentrate on doing a job of presenting a good solid case'' at an investigation after the incident. `` I would say this article is a more frank account than I have given before,'' he said. `` Not because I did n't try to give an accurate account before, but because I have a much clearer understanding of the event than I had at the time of the inquiry in 1968-69.'' <PERSON> Bucher </PERSON>, 61, who retired from the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> in 1973, described the incident in a book, `` Bucher: My Story,'' published in 1970. He is now an artist in <LOCATION> Poway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bucher </PERSON>'s letter appeared in Proceedings and <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> History </ORGANIZATION> magazines published by the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Annapolis </LOCATION>, a professional society for sea services personnel. To mark the 20th anniversary of the Pueblo incident, the 1988 fall issue of Naval History published the reflections of five flag officers who were involved in the incident. <PERSON> Bucher </PERSON>'s letter was an unsolicited response to that article, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stillwell </PERSON>, editor-in-chief of Naval History. `` I was surprised when I saw the -LRB- initial -RRB- article. Ninety percent of what was in that article was never mentioned during the Pueblo inquiry. It was filled with misinformation,'' <PERSON> Bucher </PERSON> said. The Pueblo lacked the proper equipment to repel an attack, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> admirals knew the mission was risky yet approved it anyway, and <LOCATION> Pueblo </LOCATION> officers were not kept properly informed of world events affecting the ship, <PERSON> Bucher </PERSON> charged in his letter. The Pueblo, under the guise of a technical research ship, was commissioned to seek intelligence, including pinpointing radar and other defense installations. The North Koreans captured the vessel on Jan. 23, 1968, keeping its crew hostage until Dec. 22, 1968. One sailor died in captivity. Rear Admiral <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, then-commander of Naval forces in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, wanted two .50 - caliber machine guns stowed below the decks of the When <PERSON> Bucher </PERSON> argued that the guns should be available for use topside, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> ordered that they be covered by tarps to disguise them. <PERSON> Bucher </PERSON> has been widely criticized for not having fired a shot to protect the ship. Retired Admiral <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyland </PERSON>, then-commander in chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION>, levied sharp criticism against <PERSON> Bucher </PERSON> in the initial article. `` He never manned the guns. He did n't go to general quarters until he'd already been fired upon and sustained some casualties. ... <PERSON> Bucher </PERSON> got a completely failing grade,'' he said. <PERSON> Bucher </PERSON> wrote that the Pueblo was surrounded by four Korean torpedo boats and one gunboat, and `` there was no possiblity of manning our machine guns, or getting to the ammunition ... The tarps were frozen and the gun positions totally exposed.'' From the outset, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials knew that it was risky to send an essentially unarmed ship into international waters off <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bucher </PERSON> said. He also said he had been told that there was no probability of an attack, but that <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials promised retaliation just in case, <PERSON> Bucher </PERSON> said. In fact, no <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces came to the Pueblo's aid despite a call for help, he said.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Seek Moratorium on Cuts in Medicare Payments to Hospitals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than 160 senators and representatives put their names on a proposed resolution Tuesday seeking a one-year moratorium on cuts in Medicare payments to hospitals. Reductions in <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> payments to health care institutions will accelerate the growing rate of hospital closures, putting the health care of the elderly, disabled and even entire communities at risk, the lawmakers said. Though they acknowledged the nation's budget pressures, the sponsors said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> also needs time to analyze the impact of the payment policies of the $ 87 billion federal health insurance program for the elderly and disabled. `` One year from now I think we're going to be in a position to make a better judgment about where we should go and what we should do,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill., a chief sponsor of the non-binding resolution `` But to devastate hospitals further today, to put the squeeze on the poor and elderly of this nation is unwise.'' Former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, before he left office last month, sent <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> a proposed budget for fiscal 1990, which begins Oct. 1, that trimmed $ 2.4 billion from Medicare Part A, the section of the program that pays hospitals. He also proposed cutting about $ 1 billion from <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Part </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> B </ORGANIZATION>, which pays physicians. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> called for a total 10 percent growth in total <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> spending, which would hold the program's budget to $ 94.9 billion next year. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is due to send <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> his budget proposal next week, and according to Rep. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Stark </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on health, the Medicare portion is expected to be about the same as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> proposed Stark told reporters that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> budget director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> told him last week that his budget proposal `` wo n't be much different from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> proposal relative to <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>, and my guess is the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> will come out at somewhere between $ 2 -LRB- billion -RRB- and $ 5 -LRB- billion -RRB- cut in Medicare.'' `` I ca n't really see that we'll do anything different from what we've done in previous years, and that means we'll take some out of the hospitals and some out of the doctors and will try to give some assistance in that to the inner city hospitals ... and rural hospitals,'' he said. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> are in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> this week for the group's annual meeting and they have been visiting the lawmakers on Capitol Hill about issues of interest, including the resolution for a one-year reprieve from cuts. `` This resolution is very important to say: Wait. We simply can not make further reductions without cutting into the quality of care,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON>, R-Kan. The lawmakers noted that more than 80 hospitals closed last year, more than 400 have closed since 1982 and many others are losing money, particularly rural and inner city hospitals. Medicare cutbacks are largely to blame, they said. `` Fifty percent of hospitals are losing money on every Medicare patient,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Conn </LOCATION>. `` We can not cost-cut with blindness to the consequences of that policy. Meanwhile, Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, introduced legislation designed to save faltering rural hospitals by boosting government reimbursements for patient care and improving physican recruitment. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> blamed inequities in the <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> prospective payment system for contributing to the problems of rural hospitals. Under the program, hospitals are reimbursed for the average costs of their elderly Medicare patients and not on actual costs.

<HEAD>EPA Chief Promises Acid Rain Work</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, picked to head the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday his chief anti-pollution priority will be acid rain and he promised to produce a legislative proposal for the problem as soon as possible. `` Acid rain for our point of view is first out of the box,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The panel is expected to vote later this week on <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>'s nomination as head of the federal government's top agency dealing with the environment. `` It's ahead of everything else,'' <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said at another point when asked by Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>., if he believed acid rain was a serious problem For more than six years, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has been grappling with legislation to curb acid rain. But tough national legislation did n't gain <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> support under former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and last year became bogged down in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Acid rain, blamed for polluting vast areas of vegetation, streams and lakes along the country's northern tier and in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, is caused primarily by emissions from fossil fuel burning plants in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is committed to `` the substantial reduction of acid rain by the end of this century'' and the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> is working to develop proposed changes in the federal Clean Air Act to deal with the acid rain problem. During the 2 -LCB- - hour hearing, both Republicans and Democrats, including senators who are often on opposite sides, praised <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, who for 16 years has been executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> and the president of World Wildlife Fund Sen. <PERSON> Quentin </PERSON> <PERSON> Burdick </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.D. </LOCATION>, committee chairman, called <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> `` a person ... who appreciates that a great nation must be a good steward of its land, its air, its water and its natural resources.'' `` I'm pleased to join the chorus of admirers and welcomers,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, noting <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> was introduced to the panel by no fewer than five senators from three states. Sen. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Symms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Idaho </LOCATION>, objected to what he called the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s often `` heavy handed'' approach to enforcing environmental laws But he praised <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>'s nomination. <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> promised to enforce such laws `` aggressively and timely whenever it is warranted to safeguard public health and environmental quality,'' but said he also hopes to deal with environmental problems through consensus and cooperation. Denouncing the `` bitterness, the polarization, the wasted resources and other excesses'' that have marked conflicts between environmentalists and industry in the past, <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said he is convinced the country can both protect its environment and have economic growth. Several senators, noting <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>'s desire for consensus, expressed concern that the approach might lead to inaction on part of the EPA. `` Will you conciliate, mediate, negotiate away our environmental laws?'' asked Sen. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON>, D-Mont., who supported <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON> urged <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> to be `` an environmental advocate'' in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration and not allow the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to be a `` reluctant combatant as it often has been'' in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. `` You can count on me being an advocate,'' replied <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>.

 Two tiny polyps removed from Gov. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>'s colon were found to be non-cancerous, according to test results released Tuesday. The polyps were discovered and removed Monday during <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>'s regularly scheduled six-month checkup A year ago, one of three polyps removed from <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>'s colon contained cancer cells. Three removed in June were benign. `` We are very happy to report that the pathology analysis has confirmed that the two polyps are a common type of benign polyp,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>, coordinator of gastroenterology at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>. `` There was no evidence of any malignancy or pre-cancerous changes.

 About 80 demonstrators demanding more commitment to stopping AIDS closed the Golden Gate Bridge during Tuesday's morning rush hour, stalling thousands of commuters in a traffic jam. The fog-shrouded bridge was closed for 46 minutes while <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> officers arrested 26 protesters affiliated with a group called `` Stop AIDS Now Or Else.'' The demonstrators were cited on charges of trespassing and creating a public nuisance and then released, officials said. A spokeswoman for the group said they chose the bridge for the protest because it would be `` the most disruptive to people.'' `` AIDS is disrupting our lives and until people's lives are disrupted, they do n't pay attention,'' said <PERSON> Darla </PERSON> <PERSON> Rucker </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the group of AIDS victims and friends of AIDS patients. `` We do n't have the time to wait. My friends are dying all around me.'' The demonstrators closed all the traffic lanes by spreading a banner that read: `` AIDS = Genocide; Silence = Death; Fight Back,'' according to <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> officers, who called for police vans to cart off those arrested. Some motorists stuck along <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 101 north and south of the bridge expressed anger at the demonstration and traffic tie-up. <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Larkspur </LOCATION>, said she veered off the highway in <LOCATION> Marin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, parked at a <ORGANIZATION> Safeway </ORGANIZATION> store and queued up with some 20 people to use five public telephones. `` People at <ORGANIZATION> Safeway </ORGANIZATION> were very upset. They said it was going to defeat their -LRB- the protesters' -RRB- cause,'' said <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON>, who finally arrived at her destination about 9:30 a.m. `` The people said, ` Hey, if they think I'm going to be for them, doing something like this, forget it.''' One motorist whose trip into <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> usually takes a half-hour finally parked his car and took a ferry across the bay. Although he beat most of the traffic, he said it took him two hours to reach his office. Leaflets that the protesters distributed to motorists criticized the government's handling of the AIDS crisis, quoted several AIDS victims and urged motorists to `` Get out of your car and join us.'' `` Are you sick and tired of being stuck on this bridge? So are we!'' the leaflet said. `` Are you wondering how long it will be? So are we! Are you wondering ` Why me?' So are we!'' A caller to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> bureau in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> said the group was protesting `` the inactivity of the government the last eight years and telling <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> we're not going to remain inactive.'' `` We're going to continue to put pressure on <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to do more for people with AIDS,'' the caller said, refusing to identify himself.

 <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> staffers in <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> fought last summer's forest fires so unenthusiastically that critics might well charge them with illegal use of funds, according to an internal memo given to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday. The Aug. 15 memo was written for the western regional director by <ORGANIZATION> Sequoia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> fire specialist <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>, who paid a one-week visit to Yellowstone starting last July 28 to help project the courses of the fires. On July 21, <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> ordered the service to drop its `` let it burn'' policy and fight all fires. By the time snow arrived in late September, more than 700,000 acres, a third of the park, had been burned over, though the service says almost all of that will quickly rejuvenate. Under the `` let it burn'' policy, fires that met certain conditions were supposed to be allowed to burn themselves out, but fires that threatened lives or developed areas or areas outside the park were supposed to be fought. The <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, part of the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, conducts commercial timbering on most land adjacent to <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, and fights all fires there. `` The tactics used for these fires might well result in the suggestion that <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> was using suppression dollars to achieve natural resource benefits, a patently illegal use of these funds,'' said the <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> memo. Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Marlenee </PERSON>, R-Mont., submitted the memo at a joint hearing of the national parks subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the forests subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> On the memo, another official, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilgore </PERSON>, chief of resource management and research in the western region of the service, had written, `` Perhaps not circulated widely at this time ... until we get our act together.'' Projections made on July 3 by the <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> staff `` showed, as we did, that the Fan fire would eventually leave <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> and burn <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> lands. Yet no firm suppression action was taken until the fire was within a mile of the boundary,'' <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> wrote. The memo said the Yellowstone staff often `` seemed to be satisfied to call the ... park boundary the confinement line'' corresponding to natural boundaries that could be relied on to check fires, `` although few natural barriers could be found there.'' After <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON>'s order, `` in spite of millions being spent and 2,000 fires, <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> staffers were bemoaning the fact that new starts, as mandated by the secretary'' had to be fought, the memo said. Despite his criticisms, <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> said the fires had improved the ecosystem of the park. <PERSON> Marlenee </PERSON> said the memo showed that <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON>'s policy was `` not being carried out,'' though it did not make specific allegations that the secretary's order was disobeyed. <PERSON> Denis </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON>, deputy director of the park service, said points raised in the memo would be `` absolutely'' checked out by an internal investigations team. <PERSON> Marlenee </PERSON> and other members of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have accused the park service of disregarding the interests of residents dependent on tourism through the `` let it burn'' policy.

<HEAD>Wind Damage to Land Worse in November, December</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Wind damage to land in the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> is up sharply, reflecting the 1988 drought that hit much of the nation in the spring and summer, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. Wilson Scaling, chief of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Soil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said nearly 2.2 million acres were reported damaged in November and December, up more than 80 percent from 1.2 million acres in the same two months of 1987. `` A lot of the damage is a result of drought,'' Scaling said. `` The reasons vary by area, but major factors are lack of -LRB- crop -RRB- residue and poor vegetative cover _ both caused by a lack of moisture.'' Scaling said more than 80 percent of the land reported damaged was cropland, the remainder primarily rangeland. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> accounted for more than 30 percent of the erosion damage in November and December with 664,128 acres. Scaling said that in addition to the damaged land in November and December, nearly 19 million acres were `` in condition to blow,'' with five months still remaining in the critical wind season. November and December are the first two months of an annual seven-month season when winds are highest and the soils are driest in the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>. Surveys were made in 541 counties of the 10-state region. Although the 1987-88 season began with relatively light damage, it picked up as moisture conditions worsened. When the season ended last May 31, more than 13 million acres had been damaged, the second-largest acreage since the agency began records in 1935. The most widespread was in 1955 when about 16 million acres of <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> land were damaged by wind. Another bad year was 1980-81 when 12.5 million acres were damaged. According to the survey, the state-by-state breakdown comparing damaged acres in November and December with the damage during the same two months of 1987-88, included: _ <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, 28,795 acres damaged this season and 17,070 in 1987-88 _ <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, 135,550 and 31,520 _ <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, 510,875 and 304,023 _ <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, 54,405 and 74,590 _ <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, 51,100 and 3,300 _ <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, 188,200 and 230,000 _ <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, 68,480 and 31,288 _ <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, 112,250 and 69,400 _ <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, 664,128 and 250,220 _ <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, 346,754 and 190,885

 Three years after stepping out of Soviet prison, human rights activist <PERSON> Natan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> appears headed for a new career as <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. An aide to Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and another senior government official Tuesday confirmed radio reports that <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> chose <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> for the post, which will have to be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s spokesman, said the prime minister hopes the former refusenik's worldwide popularity will be a boon to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s public image that has taken a beating during the Palestinian uprising `` We hope he could help improve our image,'' <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> said. `` This is definitely the consideration.'' Later, however, <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> said in a statement that <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> had not yet been officially nominated. `` Such an idea was indeed raised, but there is no decision yet on that nomination,'' he said. The report that <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> was chosen took many Israelis by surprise and prompted concern among some diplomats about angering the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> at a time when <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has ended a 20-year diplomatic break to improve ties with the Jewish state. <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON>, 41, served nine years of a 13-year sentence in Soviet prisons and labor camp on charges of anti-Soviet espionage before being freed in a dramatic East-West spy swap on <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Glienicke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> on Feb. 11, 1986. <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> was an outspoken activist for the emigration movement of Soviet Jews and belonged to a human rights committee headed by Nobel Peace Prize laureate <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> that sharply criticized Soviet treatment of prisoners and national minorities. <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON>'s case was made famous largely by the efforts of his wife, <PERSON> Avital </PERSON>, who waged a tireless campaign during their forced separation of 12 years. <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> did not answer his telephone Tuesday and declined direct comment when interviewed by <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>, saying he had not been formally appointed. Pressed by the interviewer, <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> added: `` I will say only what I want to say. I have enough experience with interrogations and I know how to give answers.'' A government official said <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> also was the choice of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s Russian-born Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>. His appointment will need approval from Finance Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> under his <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s coalition agreement with <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc. It also will need Cabinet approval. One government official said on condition of anonymity that the approval may be delayed over fears of offending the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which has warmed ties with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> recently. The Soviets broke relations after <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> occupied <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> land during the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. `` Now that we're on the eve of renewing diplomatic ties, on such a delicate time in our relations with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, it could take some time to determine whether this would not offend them,'' said the official. <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> has kept a low profile in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Last year, he founded a lobby group that seeks to improve conditions for thousands of Soviet emigres plagued by shortages in jobs and housing. He has stayed out of politics and said in a recent interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that he had not found his place in any of the parties. He was critical of the divisiveness in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 120-member <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> that has 15 parties and said he would like to see the electoral system changed. `` I'm concern that everything in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is partisan. I'd like to see more mutual values and consensus in party politics,'' <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> said. At the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> may find himself being called on to defend <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s strong tactics in trying to quell the nearly 14-month Palestinian uprising in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Arab groups once sought his support in vain, he said. `` To say that because <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> was against the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> this should also make him against the Israeli government, this is n't true. There is no parallel between them,'' he said. <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> said he investigated complaints about <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s behavior in the territories and defended the stance of his new homeland. `` For a country in a state of war, you can not have the same rules as for a country not at war. But it is important to keep democracy,'' <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Company Suspected Of Selling Rocket Parts To Libya, Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MUNICH, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prosecutors on Tuesday launched a criminal investigation of a <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> company suspected of illegally selling rocket guidance equipment to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, West German television reported. Earlier Tuesday, a government-owned company said it found evidence that it was duped by another West German firm into providing plans for a suspeted poison gas factory in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, believing the technology was being used for a <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> pharmaceutical plant. The ARD television network said customs officials in <LOCATION> Stuttgart </LOCATION> gave <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> investigators documents linking the company Globesat to the alleged sale of rocket guidance equipment to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. The report gave no additional details but said officials suspect West German export laws and regulations governing the sale of military technology may have been violated. Globesat's <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> offices were closed Tuesday night, and company officials could not be immediately reached for comment. Another Bavarian company is under investigation by prosecutors in <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> in connection with allegations that it helped <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> develop the ability to refuel its warplanes in flight. Meanwhile, the government-owned <ORGANIZATION> Salzgitter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industriebau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> GmbH </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement that a review of company records `` revealed that were were deceived'' in its transactions with Imhausen-Chemie, a company suspected of playing a larger role in the suspected chemical weapons plant in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Salzgitter </LOCATION> said that among its records was a letter from Imhausen-Chemie that mentioned <LOCATION> Rabta </LOCATION>, site of the plant south of the Libyan capital of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>. The statement did not reveal further contents of the February 1985 letter but said it was turned over to prosecutors investigating possible violations of export laws. <LOCATION> Salzgitter </LOCATION> officials have acknowledged doing business with the Lahr-based chemical concern but have said it was contracted to produce engineeering designs for a pharmaceutical plant in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. `` Employees who were working on the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> project at the time did not assign any importance to the mention of <LOCATION> Rabta </LOCATION>'' in the letter, the statement said. The company said it had also sent experts to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> to inspect the factory it was contracted to design and found `` that our work had not been put to use there.'' It also said switching equipment <LOCATION> Salzgitter </LOCATION> supplied was not installed there. <LOCATION> Salzgitter </LOCATION> officials said the company is considering legal action against Imhausen-Chemie. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials contend the plant in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> is designed to produce chemical weapons. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> says it is a pharmaceutical factory. Imhausen-Chemie is the target of a criminal investigation to determine if export laws were broken in connection with deliveries for the Libyan plant. Several companies have admitted doing work for Imhausen-Chemie, but deny knowledge that their equipment and blueprints were destined for <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Federal subsidies totaling almost $ 1.3 billion are being paid to cotton and rice farmers for taking part in 1988 acreage programs, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hertz </PERSON>, executive vice president of the departments <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said eligible producers of upland cotton will receive final deficiency payments of $ 725 million under the 1988 program. The rice payments total $ 570 million, he said. Deficiency payments are made under a formula to make up the difference betwen a target price for a commodity and an average of market prices or the government price support loan rate, whichever is higher. In the case of cotton, for example, the market price average was 56.5 cents per pound, or higher than the support level of 51.8 cents. The target was 75.9 cents. Thus, the `` deficiency'' payment is 19.4 cents per pound. For rice, the target was $ 11.15 per 100 pounds. The market price average of $ 6.84 exceeded the loan rate of $ 6.63, so the deficiency payment is 4.31 per hundredweight.

<HEAD>Leftist Newspaper Folds After 112 Years, Bans By Bismarck and Hitler</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The newspaper Vorwaerts -LRB- Forward -RRB-, which survived bans by <PERSON> Bismarck </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> and championed Social Democratic causes for 112 years, is folding because of heavy financial losses, the party said Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has spent about $ 27 million since 1970 to cover the weekly newspaper's losses. But rising costs and falling circulation forced the party to close the newspaper, party treasurer <PERSON> Hans-Ulrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Klose </PERSON> told reporters. The decision, reached `` with a heavy heart,'' came after it became clear that the leftist-liberal newspaper would not be able to raise its circulation of 46,000 by 50 percent. The weekly's staff of 44 will lose their jobs when the last issue goes on sale on Saturday. Founded in 1876 by <PERSON> Wilhelm </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasenclever </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wilhelm </PERSON> <PERSON> Liebknecht </PERSON>, Vorwaerts stopped appearing for 12 years when Chancellor <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Bismarck </PERSON> banned the Social Democrats in 1878. Vorwaerts took a strong anti-Nazi line and was banned by <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> in 1933. Its staff went into exile and continued to publish in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> and then <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> until German troops marched into <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in 1940. The newspaper returned to <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> soil in September 1948 as the official organ of the Social Democratic party. The national printers trade union criticized the decision by the party's leadership to fold the paper, saying the public was losing `` an important voice.''

<TEXT>
 First lady <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Tuesday helped make sandwiches for the homeless and read to children at a daycare center for poor children as she visited a drug-infested area of the nation's capital to laud the work of volunteers. Arriving at <PERSON> Martha </PERSON>'s Table about 20 blocks from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> put on a red apron to make salami and cheese sandwiches for a food truck operated by the non-profit center to feed the homeless. That done, she sat in a rocking chair as children from the facility's daycare center gathered around, quietly munching cookies she had brought from the White House. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the mother of five and grandmother of 10, read from the book `` How Fletcher Was Hatched.'' At one point, a dog in the book was described as howling. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> looked at the children's upturned faces and asked, `` Who can howl like a dog?'' That produced a cacaphony of yelping with little resemblence to a howl but Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> smiled and said, `` You got it.'' The book proved to be longer than she had anticipated _ `` This is the longest book,'' she exclaimed at one point _ so she deftly summarized and improvised to avoid reading page after page. The children seemed to take her visit in stride. When she had finished, one girl asked her to quiz the audience on what they'd just heard Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> merrily complied, asking about the name of the protagonist dog and the story's plot as the children chorused the answers. Asked by reporters if she planned to make the homeless and needy a special project, she noted that she is also involved in fighting illiteracy and said, `` Anybody who needs help and I can help them, I'm planning to try to help.'' She said she hoped her visit to <PERSON> Martha </PERSON>'s Table would help Americans realize how important volunteers are, `` what a job they do and how really important it is to help people who need a little help.''

<HEAD>Opposition Charges Coverup On Chun; Students Attack U.S. Center</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The opposition accused the government of a coverup after prosecutors issued a report Tuesday that did not link former President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON> to corruption and power abuse. In the southern city of <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>, dozens of students demanding punishment for <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> and the withdrawal of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> troops threw firebombs at a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cultural center for the second time this month. The three main opposition parties said they will jointly seek to appoint a special prosecutor to make a thorough investigation of alleged wrongdoing involving <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, his family and associates during <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s seven-year rule. In a report wrapping up nearly a year of investigation, the prosecution said 47 people have been arrested, including 13 members of <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s family, a former intelligence chief, two ex-Cabinet ministers, a governing party lawmaker and a former <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> mayor. Senior prosecutor <PERSON> Park </PERSON> <PERSON> Chong-chul </PERSON> said 20 others have been indicted but not detained. No dates for trial were given. Those arrested or indicted were charged with embezzlement and abuse of authority for personal gain, but none was accused of raising illegal political funds for <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, a major charge raised by the opposition. Prosecutor General <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ki-choon </PERSON> said the prosecution conducted its investigation in a `` neutral and independent manner.'' Rep. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Sang-soo </PERSON>, spokesman for the largest opposition group, the <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, said the report showed the prosecution took its cue from President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON> and did not look into alleged wrongdoing by <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, who has carried out broad reform and sought to distance himself from <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, has opposed punishment for the authoritarian former president, saying it would amount to retaliation. <PERSON> Suh </PERSON> <PERSON> Chung-won </PERSON>, spokesman for the No. 2 opposition group, the <ORGANIZATION> Reunification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, also accused the government of a coverup and called for the appointment of a special prosecutor. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, 58, who left office last February, denied any personal corruption, but he surrendered $ 24 million in political funds before going into rural exile in November. Radical students and dissidents have demonstrated frequently in recent months, demanding that <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> be punished on charges of corruption and human rights violations. About 50 radical students, shouting anti-Chun and anti-U.S. slogans, hurled dozens of firebombs at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cultural center in <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>, an opposition stronghold 180 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> reported no casualties or property damage. Local news reports said about 100 South Korean riot police guarding the center fired tear gas and chased the attackers away in a few minutes. Earlier Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> denied reports it decided to close the <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> center but said it could be shut down after more attacks, of which there were 26 since 1981 and six last year alone. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been seeking promises from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> authorities that they would provide adequate protection for the <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> center and its staff.

 The judge in <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s Iran-Contra trial chose seven people for possible jury duty during Tuesday's long opening day but said there could be problems with the `` triability of the case'' because so many potential jurors had seen or read of North's testimony in congressional hearings. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said only 16 of the first 54 prospective jurors indicated on questionnaires that they were n't exposed to North's congressional appearances in which he supplied details about misleading <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and shredding documents The former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide testified to <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> investigating committees in 1987 under a grant of limited immunity from prosecution. <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers, who contend an impartial jury can not be empaneled, objected as <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>'s picked the first seven people for a pool from which the jury might eventually be chosen. The selection process will continue Wednesday. Defense lawyers also filed a motion asking that `` in the event a jury can be empaneled, it should be sequestered immediately to minimize the potential for exposure to immunized testimony and to protect Lt. Col. <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s constitutional rights.'' One of those in the pool of prospective jurors, a retired postal clerk, said she paid as much attention to <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s televised testimony as she paid to `` the three Stooges.'' She said her house had burned down and she was occupied at the time of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s congressional testimony with itemizing household items that had been lost in the blaze Still, <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers objected to her selection, noting she said she turned on a TV set during <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s testimony but said in her questionnaire she had seen none of the hearings. Another ordered into the jury pool was an unemployed man looking for work as a security guard who said he saw North on television during the congressional hearings but knew nothing about him. Attorney <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> objected to the selection, saying that `` if he heard even one'' small portion of North's testimony, `` which he very easily could have,'' he should be disqualified. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> also heard arguments on how exposure to <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s earlier testimony should affect qualification or disqualification of other potential jurors. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Keker </PERSON>, the head of the prosecution team, argued that the question should be whether a potential juror can be fair and impartial, not whether the person was exposed to <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s testimony. In that testimony, <PERSON> North </PERSON> detailed instances of misleading <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and altering and shredding documents as well as other matters for which he is now charged with crimes. North attorney <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said anyone who was exposed to <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s testimony should be disqualified, even if the person remembers nothing about it <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said jurors could experience `` sudden recall'' as the trial progresses and details of the case against <PERSON> North </PERSON> are presented and that therefore `` all the work is for naught'' in attempting to select a fair and impartial jury. As proceedings began, <PERSON> North </PERSON>, dressed in a dark suit, sat at the defense table. He had testified to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in his ribbon-bedecked Marine uniform but has since retired from the service. North's trial on charges of lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, shredding evidence and conspiring to commit tax fraud `` arises following a period of fairly intense publicity on television, newspapers, magazines'' which will continue, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said. He quickly excused the first five prospective jurors after all said they had been exposed to <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s 1987 testimony, in which he detailed activities in connection with which he is now accused of crimes. North's attorney, <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, also sought to rule out as jurors anyone who in recent days had seen <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s congressional testimony replayed in news reports as the trial start neared. <PERSON> Keker </PERSON>, who heads the prosecution team for independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, said he wanted to present arguments on the process of automatically disqualifying prospective jurors because they thought they might have been exposed to <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s testimony. The judge said he wanted to consider `` how we're going to deal with this problem. ... This relates to the triability of the case.'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> wants to find 50 people out of a pool of 300 who have not been exposed to the congressional testimony of North or other witnesses at the congressional hearings. Indicted last March, the retired <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant colonel and decorated <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran is the first figure in the Iran-Contra affair to come to trial. He could face up to 60 years in prison and $ 3 million in fines if convicted of all 12 crimes with which he is charged. North is accused of lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about his role in funneling money to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had banned <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to them. He is accused of lying to the attorney general about his role in giving the Contras millions of dollars in profits from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's secret arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. He also is accused of shredding <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> records and participating in a tax fraud conspiracy in which wealthy donors would get tax breaks for contributions to the Contras. Former National Security Adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and arms suppliers <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> also face criminal charges in the case, but are to be tried separately later.

 <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Schreiber </PERSON> was n't warning motorists about just any chuckhole in the street outside his office. To prove it, he and others stood in the downtown street lowering a 10-foot pole completely into the opening as startled motorists veered away. City workers barricaded three of four lanes of <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> south of downtown Tuesday morning after officials were informed of the two manhole-sized holes that opened into a cavern big enough for a car. A storm sewer cave-in apparently was to blame, officials said. <PERSON> Schreiber </PERSON>, a systems analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Mid-Continent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casualty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said he saw a car hit one of the holes Monday evening. He then walked into the street to divert traffic, at times lowering his briefcase into one of the holes to demonstrate its wheel-damaging potential. Someone else found a 10-foot-long pipe to illustrate the problem for motorists. `` That was kind of fun,'' <PERSON> Schreiber </PERSON> said. `` We'd hold the pipe up standing on the pavement, and then drop it. When it all disappeared, they got the idea pretty quickly.''

 In the battle to sell military hardware, a small <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> company is about to fire a most unusual shot _ an ad that features a whiff of war. <ORGANIZATION> BEI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> is promoting its `` extraordinarily lethal'' Flechette rockets with scratch-and-sniff advertisements in trade publications. The ads, emblazoned with the slogan `` The Smell of Victory,'' release the smell of cordite, the aroma that follows a rocket explosion. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Coutoumanos </PERSON>, director of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government programs for BEI, came up with the idea in an effort to draw attention to his firm, which is small by defense industry standards. Last year, the rocket and electronics manufacturer handled about $ 47 million in defense contracts. <PERSON> Coutoumanos </PERSON> said he believes the ads, to be reproduced next month, will be a first among defense contractors although perfume manufacturers make regular use of such ads. `` My advertising usually gets lost in magazines,'' <PERSON> Coutoumanos </PERSON> said. `` I usually get buried by the big guys _ the Boeings and the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION>. Who's going to read my ad when they can look at a beautiful F-16 going over the countryside?'' <PERSON> Coutoumanos </PERSON> said defense advertising is a tough line to develop, because everything tends to look the same. He says posing pretty women alongside sleek rockets does n't impress those looking to buy military hardware. Specifically, <PERSON> Coutoumanos </PERSON> is trying to persuade <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military buyers and other defense hardware shoppers that his $ 400 - $ 800 rockets are a better value than other, more high-profile missiles, such as the Stingers `` I'd really like to hire a major star and get them to sing and dance, but it does n't work that way,'' <PERSON> Coutoumanos </PERSON> said. `` And shooting off rockets on television is n't really appropriate, I think.'' <PERSON> Coutoumanos </PERSON> said the ad will appear first in the Feb. 1 international editions of the Armed Forces Journal, then later run in <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s monthly magazine in time for the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Air Show. `` Next year, I'm going to do the ` Sound of Victory.' You're going to run your thumbnail across some kind of strip and you will hear the explosions.''

The election of the 51-year-old <PERSON> Ledwig </PERSON>, who has held the position since July 1987, took place at the <ORGANIZATION> CPB </ORGANIZATION> board meeting in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> CPB </ORGANIZATION> said.

 A conservative activist testified Tuesday he has `` on a number of occasions'' seen Defense Secretary-designate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> publicly inebriated and in the company of women other than his wife. But members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said after a closed session with the witness that he failed to provide specifics to support his allegation. `` I have made enough personal observations of this man here in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to have serious reservations about his moral character,'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel, which is conducting Tower's confirmation hearing <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON>'s comments prompted quick criticism from Sen. <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wyo </LOCATION>., who complained about `` innuendos ... and insinuations'' against the former <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., the chairman, suggested any further discussion of Tower's personal fitness take place in a previously scheduled afternoon session that was closed to the public Senators emerging from that session sounded unimpressed. `` A number of allegations prove to be wrong,'' said <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, who added that the committee is `` continuing to pursue all allegations.'' `` I heard nothing that you did n't hear in the open session. I did n't hear anything persuasive to me,'' <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON> said. Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Ill., said, `` As an old trial lawyer, I would have to say that most of what I heard has to fall into the hearsay category, even given the high motives of the witness. <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON> was unclear if Tower was married on the occasions he saw him, according to <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>. `` Beyond statements of seeing Senator Tower on a couple of occasions carrying a little more alcohol than he should have, he has n't been able to add anything specific that was n't hearsay,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif. Tower refused to comment on the allegations or executive session as he left the committee office The committee has been expected to approve Tower to head the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, and there was no immediate indication that <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON>'s remarks would change that. A closed session is scheduled Wednesday morning followed by an open session on conflict of interest, <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said. Asked if the committee's work would be completed, <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> responded, `` I hope so.'' The committee chairman said he was unsure if they would vote this week on the nomination. Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Exon </PERSON>, D-Neb., said he expected a vote next week Tower was not present when <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON> took the witness chair and uttered in public the allegations that had simmered for several weeks while President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was deciding on a candidate to head the Pentagon. `` Over many years, I have encountered the nominee in a condition lacking sobriety as well as with women to whom he was not married; I recognize senators' wives because I worked here in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for many years,'' <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON> said. `` I did encounter this on a number of occasions.'' Other witnesses also spoke out against the nominee, questioning Tower's support for the Star Wars defense proposal and his ability to institute <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> reforms in light of his past ties to defense contractors. But it was <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> and a longtime proponent for the most conservative of Republican causes, who got the most attention. He contended that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s transition team received hundreds of letters criticizing Tower, some containing specific allegations of moral impropriety against the nominee, but did not bring the letters to the president's attention. But <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON> said he never saw the letters. Tower was dogged by allegations of drinking and womanizing before his nomination was announced. In divorce papers filed by his second wife, <PERSON> Lilla </PERSON> <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Cummings </PERSON>, Tower was accused of `` marital misconduct.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has defended Tower, saying an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> background check found nothing that would prevent him from serving as defense secretary. When he announced the nomination he dismissed `` a lot of rumors that proved to be groundless.'' Tower, a 63-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION>, served 24 years in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, including a tenure as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> from 1981-84. <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON> also criticized Tower's record on the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION>, saying that the nominee sees Star Wars as a `` bargaining chip'' for negotiations. Tower said last week he does not `` believe that we can devise an umbrella that can protect the entire <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> population from nuclear incineration. I think that's unrealistic.'' He said a more limited system might work but cautioned that `` it remains to be seen whether that is a realistic objective.'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>, questioned Tower's commitment to <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> reform in the wake of last year's <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> procurement scandal and the former senator's ties to defense contractors. `` His confirmation would signal to the defense contractor community that they have little to fear from any meaningful reform of defense procurement procedures,'' <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said. `` It would signal that the ` revolving door' of Pentagon-defense contractors relationships was still in vogue,'' he said. Tower said last week in two days of testimony that he received fees of more than $ 1 million for consulting work for seven defense contractors, including such industry giants as <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Martin-Marietta </ORGANIZATION>. He promised to implement reform recommendations of a presidential commission and the Goldwater-Nichols Act. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, senior fellow at the <ORGANIZATION> Fulbright </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION>, accused Tower of stonewalling Pentagon reforms and said the former senator `` never met a weapons systems he did n't like.'' `` I do not see the need for someone associated with a ` fire hose' approach to the defense budget and someone who is mired in the ` revolving door' culture,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted unanimous approval Tuesday evening of <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> as President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s transportation secretary. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, whose confirmation came only hours after a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee swiftly approved the nomination, said, `` I will work hard to make all modes of transportation safer, more efficient and less expensive for the American consumer.'' He also pledged to work with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the public, transportation industries and all interested groups to develop a new national transportation policy `` for the 1990s and beyond.'' Both Democrats and Republicans on the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> praised <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> as an excellent nominee. The panel took less than five seconds to give unanimous voice-vote approval to the former federal prosecutor who flies airplanes and has been running the nation's second-largest transit system in northern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. Sen. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, praised all of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Cabinet selections, saying he was `` deeply impressed by the openness, integrity and the smarts'' of both <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>, whose nomination as commerce secretary also was approved by the On one controversial issue, in written response to a committee question submitted after last week's hearing, <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said he would review the mileage standards required of automakers for 1990. Unless the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> acts, the standard would increase from 26.5 miles per gallon for 1989 to 27.5 for 1990. The auto industry opposes the tougher standard set under a federal fuel conservation law. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, 50, also promised during his confirmation hearing to support mandatory drug testing for transportation workers in safety-related jobs, to combat air terrorism and to push for fairness to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines abroad even if it means putting him at odds with the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. He said he would work to build up the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and the maritime industry. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, nicknamed `` Sam the Hammer,'' gained a reputation for toughness as he headed up a special investigative team that successfully prosecuted former Illinois Gov. <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerner </PERSON> for bribery in 1973. His nomination faced no opposition after the committee cleared away a brief controversy over <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>'s failure as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney to prosecute a major drug manufacturer. Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, had questioned <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>'s failure to prosecute <ORGANIZATION> G.D. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Searle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> on allegations that it falsified test results on its <ORGANIZATION> Nutrasweet </ORGANIZATION> artificial sweetener. <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> withdrew his objections after talking with <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, however, and announced his support for the nomination. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> told the committee the decision not to prosecute was made by his successor but he acknowledged making minor mistakes as he recused himself from the case and joined the law firm that had represented <PERSON> Searle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> and other committee members said they were convinced <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> had acted honorably and honestly in the matter. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> has been a close associate of Illinois Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> and headed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 1980 and 1988 presidential campaigns in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>.

 A Korean-American businessman charged with trying to export nerve gas also held classified documents revealing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' capability to intercept enemy communications, the government disclosed Tuesday. Papers filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> by prosecutors fighting the release of <PERSON> Juhwan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> on $ 2 million bail gave new details on the documents, which Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON> earlier said were found on a desk at <PERSON> Yun </PERSON>'s import-export business. `` Revelation of the information would not only compromise specifics of our EW -LRB- Electronic Warfare -RRB- capabilities but would also reveal details of our knowledge of enemy threat,'' said a memorandum written by <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Oetinger </PERSON>, vice director of the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warfare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> was arrested Jan. 12 by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs Agents when he arrived for a meeting with an undercover agent he believed was an arms dealer. After a hearing Monday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> released, saying the government failed to demonstrate that <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> was a risk to flee. But he stayed his order to give the government time to appeal the decision. After the government filed the new information Tuesday, <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON> refused in a late afternoon court hearing to reconsider his decision, but again stayed the order, until 3:30 p.m. Wednesday, to give the government time to take the matter to the 3rd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. Singer has argued that <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> apparently had contacts with several foreign governments, which would prefer he not stand trial in the case. The government previously has said <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> may have had contacts at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military installations. The documents filed Tuesday reveal that those contacts may have been at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases in other countries. Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. <PERSON> Arnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said he had reviewed the government disclosures but declined comment. The new information filed alleges that Korean-language documents marked `` Secret'' and found in <PERSON> Yun </PERSON>'s office show how much is known about an unidentified enemy's electronic signals and gives details of specialized warfare systems expected for use in the years 1992 and beyond. The government's new filings do not say if the documents were from the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> government or if the enemy mentioned was <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The Korean-language documents also discussed electronic countermeasures, the jamming of enemy signals and the deposition, numbers and locations of enemy forces, according to the court papers. <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> is charged along with a Briton for allegedly plotting to buy the nerve gas sarin and other military equipment for export. Authorities have said the nerve gas's possible destination was <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Cimusz </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> counterintelligence agent, said in a new affidavit filed Tuesday that <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> had been investigated previously for allegedly trying to obtain other military equipment, including night-vision equipment, fighter planes and tank parts. The government has said <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> boasted of high-level military and civilian contacts with <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, the People's Republic of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cimusz </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> has had contact with officials of two different countries that `` are of counterintellgnece interest to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'' and that he had `` official documents from a third country of counterintelligence interest to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>.''

 Authorities say they smashed a drug and weapons operation by the Sicilian Mafia and right-wing extremists that included plans to sell French warplanes to <LOCATION> Guinea-Bissau </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Newspapers said Tuesday at least 48 people had been arrested. At a news conference Monday, authorities said 72 arrest warrants were issued on charges of criminal association and trafficking in arms and drugs for suspects in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and abroad, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. Names of suspects living outside <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> were not disclosed. <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Stampa </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION> daily, said the investigation also extended to <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>. Judge <PERSON> Alba </PERSON> <PERSON> Dova </PERSON> issued the warrants in <PERSON> Massa </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrara </PERSON>, a Tuscan coastal city where the investigation was coordinated for more than a year. <PERSON> Dova </PERSON> said the link between the Mafia and right-wing terrorists `` leads one to think of the existence of an international extremist right wing political organization that finances itself through illegal financial operations and ties with organized crime.'' Much of the illegal traffic was said to have been arranged through two Italian import-export companies. Other illegal activities included trafficking in stolen art, cars and foreign currency. Some of the money was allegedly recycled through coded Swiss bank accounts. A key figure in the warrants is <PERSON> Marco </PERSON> <PERSON> Affatigato </PERSON>, a reputed leader of Nuova Ordine -LRB- New Order -RRB-, which is accused of several terrorist attacks in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> in the 1970s and early 1980s. Affatigato is believed to be in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Whether he had been arrested was not known. Among Mafia suspects caught in raids Monday were members of the <PERSON> Corleone </PERSON> family, considered <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION>'s most powerful Mafia clan, and of the Minore family from <PERSON> Trapani </PERSON>, a port in western <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION> linked to clandestine drug and arms shipments. The man thought to be the <PERSON> Corleone </PERSON> `` cashier,'' <PERSON> Michele </PERSON> <PERSON> Cillari </PERSON>, was among better-known figures arrested. Judge <PERSON> Dova </PERSON> said the investigation stemmed from the discovery of arms and drugs in 1987 on a Lebanese ship off <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Adriatic </LOCATION> coast. The ship, from <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, carried heroin, hashish, an anti-tank bazooka, Soviet grenade-launcher and other arms, authorities said. Police initially linked the shipment to alleged smuggling of arms between <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, including clandestine delivery of mines to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Several Italian industrialists and arms manufacturers were arrested, but they were freed later and the charges dropped. On Monday, officials said documents seized in connection with the ship _ including false certificates of a dummy `` Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>'' of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> _ put them on the trail of the Mafia-terrorist operation. The gang allegedly plotted to deliver French Mirage jets to <LOCATION> Guinea-Bissau </LOCATION>, acting as middlemen in return for kickbacks. An Italian representative of the African country and an official of the French manufacturer, <ORGANIZATION> Dassault-Breguet </ORGANIZATION>, identified only as Mr. <PERSON> Covanschi </PERSON>, also were said to be involved. Whether planes were delivered was not clear.

 Somali Prime Minister <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Samater </PERSON> said Tuesday his government has taken a series of steps designed to achieve peace and prosperity internally and to improve relations with its neighbors. <PERSON> Samater </PERSON> spoke in an interview at the outset of a visit partly aimed at refuting allegations that <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION> has engaged in widespread human rights abuses while attempting to put down an insurrection in the northern part of the country. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has imposed sharp cutbacks in aid to <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION> as has the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. An Australian-based aid agency pulled out of <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION> three weeks ago, citing political repression. But <PERSON> Samater </PERSON> said, `` Our position is that we have not committed human rights abuses.'' <PERSON> Samater </PERSON>'s visit is part of a diplomatic offensive the Somali government has initiated in an effort to bolser its international image. He will meet with Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON> on Wednesday and also plans consultations on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. As evidence of <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION>'s new approach, <PERSON> Samatar </PERSON> said all political prisoners, numbering between 200 and 250, are being released and that steps have been taken to ensure that persons detained on suspicion of criminal conduct have a prompt judicial proceeding. He also said that state controls over the economy are being eased in order to revitalize the country's productive capacity. In addition, he said the government is willing to move toward a political settlement with the northern-based insurgency. <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION> has enjoyed close political and military ties with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for years but many in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> were appalled last year over a reported dramatic increase in human rights abuses. Under congressional pressure, the administration placed a hold on about $ 55 million in economic assistance. <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Burkhalter </PERSON>, who monitors the rights situation in <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION> in her role as associate director of <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Watch </ORGANIZATION>, a private group, disputed <PERSON> Samatar </PERSON>'s account about the situation in <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION>. `` It's very, very serious indeed,'' she said. `` The fact that nearly half a million Somalians left their country for the dubious privilege of refuge in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> says more than anything else about human rights conditions in <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION>.'' In addition, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> last month decided to withhold food aid from an estimated 400,000 Ethiopian refugees in <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION>, contending that Somalian authorities were using the Ethiopians for military activities. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> finding had been corroborated in interviews with eyewitnesses. But <PERSON> Samatar </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION>'s own figures show that 77 per cent of the Ethiopian refugees are women or children and that the rest are too aged to fight. `` Only a small percentage is able bodied,'' he said.

<HEAD>16 Hangings; Four Tehran Radio Execs Jailed For Insulting Program</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> hanged 16 more people for various crimes and sentenced four <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> executives to jail Tuesday for a program that insulted <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>, official news reports said. Ten women and one man were hanged Tuesday in the northwestern Iranian provinces of <LOCATION> Zanjan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Markazi </LOCATION> after they `` confessed to setting up dens of corruption and adultery,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said, without elaborating. The hanging verdicts were issued by the local Islamic courts, and confirmed by the <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. Earlier, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> reported five Afghan nationals, convicted of robbery and rape, were hanged publicly Monday in the northeastern city of <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION>. They were convicted of 13 charges brought against them, including armed robberies, rape and `` terrorizing people,'' <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said without giving details. The London-based <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, which monitors human rights, on Monday called for international efforts to pressure <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> into halting what it described as a six-month campaign of political executions. It said about 1,000 people were executed during that period. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s media, which is tightly controlled by the government, has reported few political executions in the past few months. But it has said some 132 drug smugglers have been executed this month as part of an anti-narcotics crackdown. <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>'s broadcast director, <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazar-Yazdi </PERSON>, was sentenced by the <ORGANIZATION> Penal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to five years in jail, and three other executives were sentenced to four years plus 50 lashes after a Saturday broadcast that offended Islam and angered <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> did not say what exactly angered the patriarch of the Islamic revolution. But it said the episode of the daily program `` Family'' was devoted to the role of women in Islamic society on the occasion of the birthday of <PERSON> Fatima </PERSON> <PERSON> Zahra </PERSON>, the daughter and only child of Prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>, the founder of Islam. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> wrote to the managing director of radio and television, <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON>, on Sunday demanding that those responsible for airing Saturday's episode of a daily program called `` Family'' be sacked and punished. In the letter, text of which was carried by <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> on Monday, <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> said: `` If proven that there was a deliberate insult, undoubtedly the person who has made the insult receives a death sentence.'' He also warned that if such an incident was repeated the entire adminstrative body of the radio and television `` will be severely punished.'' The other three executives sentenced were <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Abulqasemi </PERSON>, director of Islamic ideology; <PERSON> Hamid </PERSON> <PERSON> Khunmeri </PERSON>, head of supervision; and <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Rasekh </PERSON>, editor of ideological programs, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, complying Tuesday with a request by governors in three coal-producing states, dropped a strike deadline and said its 1,700 workers at <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> mines would continue working without a contract. At the same time, the union expanded its effort to pressure <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> through protests and other actions aimed at the company's business partners, announcing a boycott of Virginia-based <ORGANIZATION> Crestar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and its banks Despite the decision not to strike at midnight Tuesday, union president <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> had harsh words for <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> management and said he was `` not overly optimistic'' an agreement would be reached in the next 30 to 60 days, the extension period requested by the governors of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> accused <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> officials of failing to bargain seriously and of trying to break the union. <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> thanked the union for its action and, meeting a longstanding <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> request, said its chief executive officer, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, would accept <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON>'s invitation for a face-to-face meeting. <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> officials have sought the meeting because they contend company negotiators do not have the power to make concessions. <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Odom </PERSON> suggested the two sides ask the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conciliation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to intervene in the talks and promised the company would `` exert every effort to assure that the time during the cooling off period is utilized effectively to achieve a settlement.'' Govs. <PERSON> Gaston </PERSON> <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> hailed the decision to postpone a strike and urged both sides to reach agreement on a contract. <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON>, through a spokeswoman, expressed similar sentiments. <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Crestar </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to give <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> a loan in December 1987 amounted to helping the company build a strike fund. The union's contract expired less than two months later and the miners have been working without a contract since then. Union action against the bank, <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> said, began with the withdrawal of $ 29.7 million _ $ 23 million by the Bakery and <ORGANIZATION> Confectionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> and $ 6.7 million by the UMW. <ORGANIZATION> Crestar </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Cotiaux </PERSON> said the bank regretted the union action and considered it to be unfair. `` <ORGANIZATION> Crestar </ORGANIZATION> has no dispute with union or its members,'' <PERSON> Cotiaux </PERSON> said in a statement. `` Our participation in the credit arrangement with <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> is an extension of previous credit arrangements.'' <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, is a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pittson </PERSON> last February refused to sign a wage agreement the miners union negotiated with other major eastern coal producers Over the past week, the company has been considering a union offer made a week ago in response to an offer <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> made in November. Pension and health benefits are the major sticking points in the talks, union officials said. <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> has said it planned to operate its mines in the event of the strike and possibly would hire permanent replacements.

 An Argentine ship which ran aground off the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> has floated free, and a leak of diesel fuel that was threatening penguins and other wildlife has stopped, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Renerie </PERSON> said Tuesday. But the ship, from which all passengers and crew members have been evacuated, is in danger of sinking. <PERSON> Renerie </PERSON> said the vessel is taking on water, is down at the stern where water is up to the first deck, and is heeled over 25 degrees. Two Argentine vessels were headed to the vessel to try to pump the remaining fuel from the ship and salvage it if possible, but it remained in danger of sinking and had drifted against a nearby island, he said. In <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, the government news agency <ORGANIZATION> Telam </ORGANIZATION> reported that the ship, the <LOCATION> Bahia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paraiso </LOCATION>, would probably be towed to <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gallegos </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> to be repaired. <ORGANIZATION> Telam </ORGANIZATION> quoted Argentine navy sources as saying: `` The fuel it carried, both for itself and the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> stations, was in steel drums so a spill is practically impossible.'' The ship, a 400-foot-long double-hulled vessel, ran aground Saturday about two miles from <LOCATION> Palmer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> research facility which is located about 600 miles south of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Horn </LOCATION>, the tip of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The 316 people aboard, including 82 passengers and 234 crew members, were rescued by power boats and taken to <LOCATION> Palmer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION>. The passengers and most of the crew were taken by cruise ship to the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shetland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, from which they were airlifted to the South American mainland Sunday. But 104 crewmen remain at the station, said <PERSON> Renerie </PERSON>. Because the station is equipped for only 40 people, food has been rationed to two meals a day, said a <ORGANIZATION> NSF </ORGANIZATION> statement. The crewmen will remain until the two Argentine salvage vessels are expected arrive Thursday or Friday, the statement said. The ship sustained a 35-foot-long gash in its hull, and some of the 250,000 gallons of diesel fuel began leaking, washing ashore near <LOCATION> Palmer </LOCATION> station. The fuel killed some krill, a tiny shrimp-like creature that is a vital part of the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> food chain, and has affected penguins, sea gulls and giant petrel birds, the statement said. There were no immediate details about the extent of damage to the wildlife in the pristine surroundings. `` Scientists are concerned that some research search projects may already have been affected by the leak,'' the <ORGANIZATION> NSF </ORGANIZATION> statement said. The ship was carrying supplies including jet fuel, gasoline and canisters of compressed gases to the Argentine Esperanza station near the tip of the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, it said.

<HEAD>Jury Hears Case on Earrings Made of Human Fetuses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A jury at the Old Bailey criminal court will decide whether earrings made of human fetuses are art or obscenity. Exhibit One, in a glass case, is a mannequin's head with a black curly wig, a scarf and a pair of human fetuses, of three to four months' gestation and freeze-dried, attached to its ears. Police seized the head Dec. 1, 1987, opening day of an exhibition of 40 items at the Young Unknowns art gallery in <LOCATION> Waterloo </LOCATION>, south <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The show was called In Animal. Canadian sculptor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>, 36, the creator, and gallery owner <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sylveire </PERSON>, 43, were charged with outraging public decency and causing a nuisance. They pleaded innocent, and this week a jury of 10 women and two men began listening to lawyers argue whether the work is art or outrage. <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who represents <LOCATION> Sylveire </LOCATION> and sees the case as an important test of obscenity laws, said in court Monday one purpose of art is `` to shock and jolt the public from its complacency.'' He said the fetal sculpture could be seen as demonstrating that `` women wear abortions as lightly as they wear their earrings.'' Prosecutor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Worsley </PERSON> said Tuesday the issue was not artistic merit or lack of it, but whether the earrings would shock, disgust or revolt a decent member of the public. He declared the fetuses, which were obtained from a pathology lecturer, to be an outrage to public decency. Sylveire was said to have told a journalist at the gallery he did not think the earrings were `` any more immoral than sculptors using human hair.'' <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> said he found the police reaction `` over the top'' _ too extreme. <PERSON> Worsley </PERSON> told the jury <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> `` saw nothing wrong with his work, but said that some people might have a moral objection to it.'' <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> legalized abortion in 1967, and the law allows abortions up to the 28th week of pregnancy.

 Maoist guerrillas shot a police commander to death as he walked on a dark street in an Andes mining town, officials reported Tuesday. Six gunmen killed <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Vila </PERSON> on Monday night while he was vacationing in <LOCATION> Cerro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pasco </LOCATION>, a mining town 120 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Huancayo </LOCATION>, police said. <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Vila </PERSON> commanded the national police detachment in <LOCATION> Huancayo </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Junin </LOCATION> state capital and an important trading center for the central Andes. It is 140 miles east of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. Guerrillas of the Shining Path movement have increased attacks in the area recently. Officials say the rebels want to cause economic chaos by disrupting mine production and delivery of agricultural products from the central Andes to <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. More than 12,000 people have been killed in political violence, most of them peasants in the Andes, since the Shining Path began its guerrilla campaign in 1980.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> it may seek permission to sell more than 100 F @ A-18 fighter jets to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> if the Saudis want the planes, sources said Tuesday. The possibility was raised in a cover letter to a classified list of proposed foreign arms sales submitted to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> last month. The annual list details possible <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms sales. For each large-scale sale, <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> must be notified and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> then has 60 days to block the deal. The letter left open the possibility the administration will notify <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> during the coming year of its intent to sell <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> the F-18s, but the letter does n't commit the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to such a sale. The list was compiled by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> White House and could be changed by the new administration. The list includes the sale to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> of M1-A tanks and multiple rocket launchers. Most of those items are not expected to be controversial, said the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> has told the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> it is still shopping around <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> for alternatives to the F-18, such as the French Mirage 2000 or a fighter jet produced by a joint British-French venture, the sources said. The Saudi decision may only come next year, once all the European models are available, they said. The Saudis are not in a rush to make the decision because the new jets are designed as replacement for its current <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fleet of F-5s and F-15s, which is good at least until 1995. While the Europeans are offering the Saudis better financial terms than the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Saudis </LOCATION> are still attracted by the quality of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aircraft, which have been the mainstay of their arsenal, and the pilot training program offered by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the sources said. The Saudis are also seeking to avoid an embarrassing fight with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> over such a sale, which many on Capitol Hill oppose. Sen. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>., last month put the administration on notice he would try to block an F-18 sale on the grounds it endangers <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> The two nations are technically still in a state of war. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administrations have both argued that persistent congressional rejections of such aircraft sales have driven the Saudis to look elsewhere, at the expense of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businesses and foreign policy interests.

A Democratic <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> source, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON> was picked because he is a moderate who can appeal to both Democrats and Republicans on divisive Central American policies, particularly <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. But the appointment may provoke controversy among some congressional liberals because <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON> once helped lobby <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on behalf of a military aid package for the Contra rebels fighting <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist Sandinista government. `` I think it's more than just a trial balloon,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON>, R-Kan., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON> emerged from a group that included at least two other contenders to succeed <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> in the job. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> became the lightning rod for the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> admistration's <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> policy, the longest-running dispute with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s presidency. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> had reportedly also been considering <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Helander </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> attorney, and <PERSON> Deane </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinton </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, but both were objectionable to conservatives who saw them as not sufficiently devoted to the Contras. <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON> had met in recent days with both <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, and paid courtesy calls to other congressional leaders on Tuesday. <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON>, a former speechwriter for <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>, now is a member of a Council on Foreign Relations study group on Central America.

He did not dismiss us, he listened to us with very considerable interest,'' <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said after the half-hour session at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> joined a delegation that has been on a three-week tour of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, several West European capitals and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to convince government officials to take a stronger stand against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and its policy of apartheid. The archbishop said the delegation asked <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> to consider the imposition of more economic sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> as a means of pressuring the white-rule government to abolish apartheid. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> stressed, however, the real appeal to <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> was made as an appeal against racial injustice. `` More than anything else, the call of the delegation -LRB- was -RRB- that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had to take a moral leadership in what is a moral issue facing the world,'' <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said. In 1986, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> imposed sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> despite a veto by then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, putting in place a ban on new loans and investments, a prohibition of the importation of South African coal and other materials, and halting direct U.S.-South African air links. The group of church leaders, formally known as the <ORGANIZATION> Eminent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Persons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, is composed of Metropolitan Paulos Mr <PERSON> Gregorios </PERSON>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>; Rev.

 A Soviet Jewish scientist who disappeared in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and was reported as a defector by French diplomats has arrived in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. `` All I can say is that Mr. <PERSON> Yakov </PERSON> <PERSON> Kogan </PERSON> has arrived in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> a few days ago. I am not aware of the circumstances of his arrival,'' <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Alon </PERSON> <PERSON> Liel </PERSON> said. French diplomatic sources said Tuesday that <PERSON> Kogan </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> who had been in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> for a seminar on telecommunications, dropped from sight over the weekend and was seeking asylum in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Liel </PERSON> declined comment about <PERSON> Kogan </PERSON>'s reported defection and said he did not know where <PERSON> Kogan </PERSON> arrived from. Radio <PERSON> Shalom </PERSON>, a Jewish FM station in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Kogan </PERSON> is a mathematician who participated in a seminar sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and disappeared Sunday. He was to have returned to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> quoted <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> sources as saying <PERSON> Kogan </PERSON> approached <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> representatives in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> last week in a `` direct or indirect way.'' It said the Israelis consulted with the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and decided that their consulate in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> would issue a tourist visa for <PERSON> Kogan </PERSON>, a standard procedure for every Jew who asks to immigrate to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Immediately afterwards, officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> ordered a plane ticket for <PERSON> Kogan </PERSON>, again a customary procedure regarding a Jew who can not fund a ticket, the television said. There was no immediate response from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which cut diplomatic ties with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> following the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has demanded the right of free emigration for every Jew wishing to live in the Jewish state.

 The Soviet Embassy on Tuesday denied allegations by <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s naval chief that <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> submarines continue to intrude into Swedish waters. Embassy spokesman <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Novikov </PERSON> was quoted by Swedish radio as saying Soviet captains `` have been ordered not to come any closer to Swedish territorial waters than 30 kilometers,'' about 19 miles. <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> says it has evidence of about 40 violations of its waters a year, but efforts to catch an intruder or force a sub to the surface have failed. Admiral <PERSON> Bengt </PERSON> <PERSON> Schuback </PERSON> charged Monday that <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> submarines from secret Baltic bases keep violating Swedish waters. `` They ca n't come from anywhere but hidden bases in the Baltic, and we know Western countries have no such bases,'' he said at a military seminar. But his superior, <PERSON> Torsten </PERSON> <PERSON> Engberg </PERSON>, chief of the defense staff, told the seminar that `` there is not enough evidence to identify any nationality.'' Last week the navy said it `` had indications'' that a submarine had penetrated waters outside <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>. `` Indications'' usually refer to tracks on the seabed left by mini-subs, sightings of a periscope by fishermen or sonar signals. <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> has not officially accused any nation of violations since 1983, when the government protested Soviet incursions to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Two years earlier a Soviet submarine ran aground a naval base in southern <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>.

 Officials confirmed Tuesday that the woman who claims in Penthouse magazine that she performed sexual acts for television evangelist <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> has a string of arrests in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> area. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s attorneys distributed documents showing that <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kampen </PERSON> had been arrested in <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> and <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> parishes on various charges, including theft and issuing bad checks. The documents were distributed at a news conference Monday during which <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> vehemently denied knowing <PERSON> Kampen </PERSON> and threatened to sue the magazine. <PERSON> Kampen </PERSON>, a 38-year-old stripper, claims in the March issue of Penthouse that she was <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s `` sex slave'' for six months. The magazine quotes <PERSON> Kampen </PERSON> as saying <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> demanded that she perform sadomasochistic and degrading acts. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> was defrocked by the Assemblies of God last year and saw his international ministries rocked by allegations that he paid a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> prostitute to perform sex acts for him. He confessed at that time to an unspecified sin but never discussed the accusations made by the prostitute, <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphree </PERSON>. On Monday, <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> accused Penthouse of trying to destroy his ministry through a `` diabolical and slanderous'' story. `` Feel free to publish anything you like,'' <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> warned the magazine at a news conference Monday, `` but be prepared to back it up in court.'' Penthouse Publisher <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Guccione </PERSON> said in a statement Monday that he stood behind the story. Penthouse spokesman <PERSON> Sy </PERSON> <PERSON> Presten </PERSON> said the terms of <PERSON> Kampen </PERSON>'s contract with the magazine prevented her from talking to the press, but `` we're working on setting up a press conference next week. <PERSON> Kampen </PERSON>'s arrest record is mentioned in passing in the Penthouse article. <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, who wrote the piece, said the arrests were minor. `` You would n't expect someone who got into this situation to have the background of a nun,'' he said Tuesday. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> refused to comment on charges by <PERSON> Ronda </PERSON> <PERSON> Shear </PERSON>, co-owner of the strip-tease telegram service that employs <PERSON> Kampen </PERSON>, that the woman had concocted the story after seeing a Penthouse story on <PERSON> Murphree </PERSON>. According to records distributed by <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s lawyers, <PERSON> Kampen </PERSON> was arrested in <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parish </LOCATION> on Dec. 30, 1986, and charged with criminal damage to property and theft of under $ 100. <PERSON> Kampen </PERSON> was convicted and paid a $ 200 fine and court costs, said <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> of the district attorney's office. On Aug. 17, 1973, <PERSON> Kampen </PERSON> was arrested and charged with issuing worthless checks in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parish </LOCATION>. She was given one year's probation and fined $ 40 <PERSON> Kampen </PERSON> was arrested in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> on Jan. 10, 1972, under the name of <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, and charged with using a stolen driver's license and forged receipt to get $ 53 from a department store Court records confirm she was fined $ 100 and received a suspended six-month jail sentence.

 Witnesses said a daughter of actor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> is a loving but emotionally immature parent, so a judge plans to award custody of the late actor's 1-year-old granddaughter to the girl's father. <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> announced his tentative ruling in a memorandum issued Monday. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Aissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON>, 32, is unfit for custody of <PERSON> Anastasia </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON>. `` The various mental-health professionals that testified seemed to have one common thread running through their testimony,'' <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said in his ruling. `` That is, that the mother, although loving, lacks familiarity with the child, is emotionally immature and lacks direction herself.'' The judge said he would grant custody of <LOCATION> Anastasia </LOCATION> to Dr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gionis </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Pomona </LOCATION> orthopedic surgeon, while allowing Ms. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> to visit every other weekend beginning Feb. 10. `` I've spoken to <PERSON> Aissa </PERSON> several times already,'' <PERSON> Gionis </PERSON> said. `` I'm sure we will always remain close for the mutual benefit of the child.'' Ms. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> shares custody of two children by a previous marriage. <PERSON> Gionis </PERSON>' attorney, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephan </PERSON>, called private investigators, psychologists and family counselors to testify during a lengthy hearing to show that Ms. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> spent little time with <PERSON> Anastasia </PERSON> when the girl was home for visits, often leaving the child to the care of housekeepers. In an unrelated development, the spacious <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> estate where Ms. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> and a friend, financier <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Luby </PERSON>, 52, were bound and pistol whipped by two intruders last October has been put on the auction block to pay off the mortgage. The attackers were never caught. The minimum bid on <PERSON> Luby </PERSON>'s 7,000-square-foot, six-bedroom house must be nearly $ 1.2 million cash in order to pay off the mortgage, according to a notice of trustee sale filed Jan. 23.

 Convicted killer <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Lightbourne </PERSON> got a stay of execution Tuesday, less than 15 hours before he was to die in the electric chair. A second convicted killer also slated for execution Wednesday was saved by an earlier stay, and officials were unsuccessful in getting that ban lifted.

<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 12th graf, `For the...' to CLARIFY and add that allowing

boosting private insurance.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government Tuesday proposed the biggest shakeup in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s free health system, boosting private health insurance and allowing big hospitals to charge fees. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, in a statement introducing a government policy document, called the plan the `` most far-reaching reform of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in its 40-year history.'' The opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which introduced free health care after World War II, accused her Conservative government of setting out to wreck the system. The changes will be drafted later as a parliamentary bill that is assured of passage by the Conservative-dominated <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. They are expected to be in operation within the next three years. The plan was seen by some as an attempt to borrow from the American health system, with its emphasis on private care, without increasing spending. `` In other words, excellent care, eventually, for perhaps as much as three-tenths of the population, but deteriorating health care for the remainder,'' said Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, a physician who leads the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Government officials said the reforms would streamline the health bureaucracy and give the public wider choice, while denying no one access to free treatment. It was a `` change of pace, rather than a change of direction,'' said Health Secretary <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is and must remain open to all regardless of income, financed mainly out of general taxation,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>. Under the plan, the 320 biggest and most sophisticated of the 2,000 state-run hospitals in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> can become self-governing in 1991, taking fee-paying private patients and billing local authorities for the others. Breaking another post-war tradition, the self-governing hospitals will charge patients for extras such as choice of meals, private telephones or television. For the first time, too, private health insurance for the elderly, who are the biggest burden on the state system, will be tax-deductible. Allowing the state-run hospitals to take in fee-paying patients also will have the effect of boosting private health insurance. Self-governing hospitals will be able to attract higher quality staff, from consultants to cleaners, by setting their own pay scales. Other changes planned over three years include fining general practitioners who resort too readily to prescibing medicines. Family doctors with big practices will get separate state budgets to buy drugs and hospital treatment from private, state or self-governing hospitals for elective surgery. They will be allowed to keep half of any savings on the drugs budget. Consultants and general practitioners will have their costs independently audited and, like hospitals, will be encouraged to compete for patients. Labor's parliamentary spokesman on health, <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, said the plan was the work `` of people who will always put a healthy balance sheet before healthy patients.'' Left-wing health workers' unions were outraged. <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> Bickerstaffe </PERSON>, leader of the biggest health union _ the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> _ described the proposals as a `` cynical charter'' to replace the <ORGANIZATION> NHS </ORGANIZATION> with `` a commercial circus.'' `` Treatment will be price-tagged, leaving the poor, the chronically sick and the elderly out in the cold. Sick people will be shunted round the country in a scramble for the cheapest care,'' said <PERSON> Bickerstaffe </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which with a staff of 1 million is second only to the Soviet army as the biggest employer in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, has been a major frustration for Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> since she won power in 1979. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> insists on her right to private health treatment `` at the time I want and with the doctor I want.'' She argues it is pointless to throw more money at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> without increasing its efficiency. The service, used by 90 percent of the population, is popular with voters and Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> has held back from exposing it to her strategy of rolling back the frontiers of socialism. Instead, spending has increased in real terms by nearly one-third since 1979 to $ 38.7 billion a year. But the enduring public image is of a system subjected to budget cuts by the <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> administration in which children die waiting for heart surgery. Waiting lists persist partly because demand is limitless and treatment ever-more expensive and sophisticated. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> spends 6 percent of gross national product on health, compared with an average of 9 percent in other industrialized countries. The service is funded out of general taxes and a compulsory 10 percent deduction for health and state pension contributions from each employee's salary, which employers have to match.

<DATELINE>LOCKERBIE, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A lone bagpiper played a Scottish lament and relatives hugged and wept Tuesday at a symbolic burial service for 17 people whose bodies were never found following the crash of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103. A single black casket containing the ashes of unidentified remains was lowered into a grave at Dryfesdale Cemetery outside <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> to the strains of `` Flowers of the Forest.'' The 30-minute prayer service was attended by about 500 mourners, including 34 relatives of six missing Americans. The ashes represented the Americans, one Canadian, three Hungarians and seven <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> residents whose bodies were either not found or identified. Police called off the search last week. A bomb exploded aboard the New York-bound Flight 103 on Dec. 21, killing 259 people aboard and 11 on the ground. The coffin was lowered into the grave by representatives of the airline, the police, the armed forces and other rescue services. Among the missing were <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rosalind </PERSON> <PERSON> Flannigan </PERSON>, whose 10-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON>, is buried nearby. Their house was destroyed in the crash. Some relatives threw soil into the grave or left personal mementos at the graveside. These included a photograph of <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON> <PERSON> Boulanger </PERSON>, 21, of <LOCATION> Shrewsbury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, and a newspaper clipping telling of one of her successful performances as a drama student. A local clergyman, the Rev. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Neal </PERSON>, said those who died `` were part of us and will forever be part of our lives. May this last farewell express the depth of our love for them. May it ease our sense of loss and strengthen our hope.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Consul General <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, and representatives of the airline and the British and Hungarian governments presented wreaths. The grave was marked by a simple granite stone presented by <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> and inscribed, `` In memory of all victims of the <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> air disaster who died on Dec. 21, 1988.'' In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that more than 100 measures to tighten security at British airports have been implemented since the bombing. Transport Secretary <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> said in a statement to Parliament that the measures include tougher conditions for issuing passes to the vicinity of aircraft, more searching of staff and articles they carry when entering controlled areas, and searching all vehicles approaching aircraft. It also includes increased patrols, a reduction in the number of control posts to release staff for improving security elsewhere, and escorting delivery goods to minimize the risk of prohibited articles reaching aircraft.

 A lawyer for convicted child killer <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said Tuesday he will appeal his client's first-degree manslaughter conviction on the ground the judge allowed evidence that inflamed and prejudiced the jury. Attorney <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> London </PERSON> said state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothwax </PERSON> prejudiced the case by letting the jury see a videotape of a seriously beaten <PERSON> Hedda </PERSON> <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, the defendant's former live-in companion, and by his instructions to the jury on intent. The lawyer objected to <PERSON> Rothwax </PERSON>'s statement at a pretrial bail application that second-degree murder defendant <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> was `` probably guilty, probably would be found guilty and probably would be sentenced to life in prison.'' `` I think that statement the judge made is something he may regret in view of the appellate issues we are going to raise in the case and we will include that,'' <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, 47, was convicted of first-degree manslaughter Monday in the death of <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>, the 6 year old he obtained at birth and raised but never legally adopted. The jury found <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> guilty after eight days of deliberations following a 12-week trial. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> faces up to 25 years in prison. `` There is no question in my mind from the length of the deliberations and from talking to the jurors ... there is no question that <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> got a fair shake from the jurors,'' <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said. But `` it is a serious issue whether <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> got a fair trial because of the judge's rulings.'' <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said the judge hurt <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> unfairly when he refused to answer `` no'' to the jurors' question about whether they should infer intent on the basis of the victim's injuries even though they had been unable to find intent. `` We felt a simple one-word answer would have answered the question,'' the lawyer said. He noted that the jury came in a short time later. `` He chose not to say ` no,' and he chose to go into some long explanation which later, according to what the jury has told us, led to the conviction on manslaughter in the first degree,'' <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said. And allowing the jury to see the tape of Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>'s injuries inflicted by <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> `` was a prejudice that I do n't know any criminal defendant could recover from.''

<BYLINE>Yusupov And Spraggett Draw; Move To Sudden-Death Finish ^By DAVID

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Artur </PERSON> <PERSON> Yusupov </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Spraggett </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> drew the seventh game in the World Chess Championship Candidates quarterfinal on Tuesday, leaving the match to be decided in a sudden-death finish. The 27-move draw left the match score tied 3.5 points apiece. The victor of the eighth game, scheduled for Thursday, will win the contest and advance to the semifinal stage. In the event of a draw, a series of sudden-death tiebreakers at increasingly high speeds on Saturday will decide the contest. Canadian observers are hoping <PERSON> Spraggett </PERSON>, a 34-year-old from <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> who will play with the advantage of white on Thursday, will defeat the pre-match favorite and become the first North American since <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON> to reach the semifinals. The winner of the Candidates, a series of knockout matches, will challenge world champion <PERSON> Garri </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> for his title. In the seventh game, <PERSON> Yusupov </PERSON>, playing white, gained a clear edge from the opening and began to build a dangerous initiative, experts said. But <PERSON> Yusupov </PERSON>, a 28-year old Muscovite, chose a safe but passive continuation on his 21st move that enabled <PERSON> Spraggett </PERSON> to neutralize white's advantage. Both players used up most of their allotted time in their early stages and left themselves only half an hour to ponder 20 moves. Each player has two hours in which to mkae their first 40 moves. Canadian observers said <PERSON> Yusupov </PERSON> appeared nervous in the latter stages of the game. `` Spraggett is in good physical shape and his nerves will be good if it comes down to a blitz finish,'' said Canadian International Master <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Hebert </PERSON>. British Grandmaster <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Speelman </PERSON> is already through to the semifinal stage of the Candidates. Former world champion <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> leads <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Johann </PERSON> <PERSON> Hjartarson </PERSON> by 1.5-0 .5 in the third quarterfinal in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash </LOCATION> The first game of the remaining match, between Dutch Grandmaster <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Timman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lajos </PERSON> <PERSON> Portisch </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Antwerp </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, was adjourned Tuesday after 61 moves.

 An explosion triggered by a mattress fire ripped through a fourth-floor apartment Tuesday, propelling three firefighters out windows and injuring eight, officials said. `` It's called a flash-back,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Szwedo </PERSON> explained. `` It has the same properties as an explosion.'' The firefighters were extinguishing what had started as a mattress fire when oxygen reached the smoldering material, causing a blast with such force that it apparently sent the firefighters out the windows, <PERSON> Szwedo </PERSON> said. The most severe injury was sustained by <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaska </PERSON>, 39, a firefighter who fell four stories, officials said. <PERSON> Gaska </PERSON> underwent surgery for abdominal injuries and was in serious condition with second-degree burns, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Reese </PERSON> <PERSON> Hospital </PERSON> nursing superviser <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 Opposition leaders and businessmen said Tuesday they were puzzled and dissatisfied with the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government's austerity plan for 1989 and will not support it. President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s speech outlining the inflation-fighting plan `` is rather nebulous,'' said <PERSON> Ramiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Gurdian </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION> and vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coordinate </ORGANIZATION>, an opposition coalition. `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> -RRB- did not mention he had the backing of the producers because he simply does n't have it,'' <PERSON> Gurdian </PERSON> said in an interview. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, in a speech before the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> on Monday, outlined a 1989 economic plan that includes budget cuts of more than 40 percent, a decrease in capital investments and restricted credit. The budgetary cuts will mean laying off about 35,000 government workers, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> was quoted as saying in an interview published Monday in the Venezuelan newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nacional </ORGANIZATION>. The plan's aim is to curb rampant inflation, which reached 20,000 percent last year and is projected to run at 300 percent a month through May. It also seeks to increase productivity in this Central American country, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said exports plummeted from $ 450 million in 1980 _ a year after the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> took power _ to $ 267 million in 1988. The <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have been meeting with labor groups and businessmen to seek their support for the plan, which <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said would cause an economic downturn initially. `` The measures have an element of a recessive character,'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said in his speech. `` This is inevitable, although temporary.'' The president said idle workers could be absorbed into agriculture, including 10,000 needed in coffee harvesting. <PERSON> Gurdian </PERSON> said the coffee harvest was about to end and doubted an office worker could be very effective as a field hand. `` Maybe they can be employed for a month, but when it's over, then what? What are you going to do with those people?'' <PERSON> Gurdian </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said his government is `` trying to apply a capitalist policy different from the other countries which have been held up to us as models.'' But he added that `` we as <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>, Marxists, Marxist-Leninists'' are trying to develop socialism within <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s reality as a Central American country. `` I've been trying to find messages of political economy, and I must confess that I'm lost,'' said <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolanos </PERSON>, a cotton grower and former president of the <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION>. `` He's cutting investments nearly to zero, and if there's no investment, there's no growth; if there's no growth, there are no new jobs,'' <PERSON> Bolanos </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> also said production costs will be strictly controlled because they `` can not be higher than in the Central American markets.'' Gurdian and <PERSON> Bolanos </PERSON> blamed high production costs on the state, which sets the price of raw materials and buys products from growers at a set price. `` They -LRB- government -RRB- tell you, ` Here's the raw materials, here's your tractor and these are going to be your profits,''' <PERSON> Gurdian </PERSON> said angrily `` I am not going to work so the state can tell me how much I'm going to earn. I work to earn money.'' The Nicaraguan Democratic Coordinate includes four political parties, three labor unions and the <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION>. The opposition newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s speech left Nicaraguans disillusioned, and it called for reforms that would let them elect a new government `` that is more efficient and advantageous for the people.'' Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Venevision </ORGANIZATION>, a private television station in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> has asked <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> for economic aid. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> met with Venezuelan President-elect <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> after his arrival in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> for <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>' inauguration, scheduled for Thursday. <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> provide cheap oil to some <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and Central American nations under the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jose </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accord </ORGANIZATION>, begun in 1975 by <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> during his first presidency. But since 1982, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> stopped providing oil to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> because <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> did not pay its bills.

 Unionized attendants at a state-run hospital temporarily halted their sickout Tuesday after they were threatened with dismissal and National Guard troops were called in to feed, wash, and dress patients. Eighty of the 91 workers scheduled to work the 3 p.m. shift showed up, and the Guard was sent home, said hospital administrator <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedict </PERSON>. The union and the state will negotiate their disputes over staffing, scheduling and overtime during a two-week cooling-off period, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON>, a governor's aide who met with union officials for 1 -LCB- hours. `` If they ca n't agree, they'll shake hands and agree to disagree, but they'll address that disagreement through the normal procedure'' of grievances and arbitration, <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> said. Union officials were not at the union hall and did not return telephone calls seeking comment. Gov. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON> called out the Guard to fill in for absent workers after talks collapsed Monday between Local 1350 of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Romeo </PERSON>, director of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, Retardation and Hospitals. <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> said <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON> had warned the workers that any who did not show up for Tuesday's third shift, beginning at 11 p.m., and could not prove they were ill would risk being fired. `` We're kind of out of our element, but we seem to be doing OK,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Mansfield </PERSON>, one of about 60 Guardsmen who rolled up the sleeves of their fatigues and went to work Tuesday morning. The state-run hospital provides long-term care to 425 patients, about 75 percent of whom are elderly. <PERSON> Romeo </PERSON>, under heavy pressure from <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON> to cut overtime costs, ordered changes in the hospital work-schedules that angered the union. The changes will remain in place during the cooling-off period, <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> said. He said the hospital's overtime budget has been $ 55,000 for each two-week pay period, but actual spending has been closer to $ 95,000. The changes are aimed at bringing that figure down to $ 85,000 per two weeks, <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> said. Eighty-five of the 106 workers scheduled for Tuesday's first shift reported for work, said <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkicki </PERSON>, the hospital's administrative coordinator The absentee rate has varied greatly from shift to shift. On Monday, most of the first shift reported for work but well over half of the second-shift workers called in sick. The Guard pitched in to perform `` non-skilled'' care, such as feeding, washing and dressing patients and changing their linens, under the direction of medical staff, said Capt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Loughlin </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, the Guard's public information officer.

<HEAD>Navy Says Boat in New Year's Eve Sinking Was Overcrowded</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The navy on Tuesday reversed its position and said the tourist boat that sank on New Year's Eve, killing 55 people, was overcrowded and not fit to venture into sea waters. A two-week examination of the boat, which was hauled from the sea floor in mid-January, showed the Bateau Mouche should have carried not more than 62 when it capsized and sank with at least 150 revelers aboard, a navy report said. The report said the popular sightseeing craft was badly maintained, had a waterline above the basement portholes, had a second-floor addition that affected the boat's stability and was full of loose, heavy tables and chairs. The boat sank while on a midnight excursion to watch fireworks off <LOCATION> Copacabana </LOCATION> beach. Days later, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> released a report that declared the boat was fit for 153 people and seaworthy, according to port authority guards. But the navy and police investigating criminal responsibility in the sinking have been under constant pressure from civic groups comprised mostly of friends and relatives of victims. The navy said Tuesday it would open an investigation to determine why naval engineers approved the boat for large tourist excursions. The <ORGANIZATION> navy </ORGANIZATION> said it also would investigate why port authority guards allowed the midnight sail despite obvious overcrowding and severe rocking of the boat in high waves. The owners of the boat and the tourist agency that organized the excursion were imprisoned briefly last week and released on bail. Police have not yet determined criminal responsibility.

<HEAD>13 Killed; Gov't Assigns Bodyguards, Invites Foreign Monitors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEXTER CRUEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 At least 13 more people were killed in pre-election violence, officials said Tuesday. The government assigned armed bodyguards to candidates but took steps to control their movements. The government also invited foreign groups to monitor the Feb. 15 parliamentary election. Eleven of the latest slayings were blamed on Sinhalese radicals of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and occurred in southern and central <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> late Monday and Tuesday, a police officer said on condition of anonymity. Indian troops stationed in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> to enforce an Indian-brokered Tamil peace accord on Tuesday shot and killed two people believed to be members of the most powerful of the Tamil separatist group, the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION> in northern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, police said. A senior police officer, also speaking privately, said the government has assigned 8,376 bodyguards _ six to a candidate. `` In addition to the politicians being issued two pistols, one for himself and the other for his most trusted bodyguard, police have issued four repeater shotguns'' for each candidate, the officer said. Political violence before the election prompted the government to order candidates to keep their gun-toting bodyguards off the streets after sundown, a senior police officer said Tuesday. Ten candidates have been slain in the past 3 -LCB- weeks. The governing <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, headed by President <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>, blames the Sinhalese front and opposition parties for most of the political killings. The biggest opposition group, former Prime Minister <PERSON> Sirimavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bandaranaike </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and other opposition groups say the political assassinations were carried out by bodyguards and other gunmen working for members of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Police statistics say 600 people were killed in political violence in January, but a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> diplomat said he thought the figure was too high. The diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, declined to say what he thought the actual toll might be. The government on Tuesday said it was inviting international groups to monitor the election in which nine political parties and 10 independent groups are fielding 1,396 candidates for the 225-member Parliament. The government said the People's <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> killed 800 people prior to January. Most of the victims were government officials, policemen or supporters of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The front vowed to kill anyone who supported the government's attempts to end an insurrection by members of the Tamil ethnic minority The front said a July 1987 peace accord offered too many concessions to the Tamils, who comprise 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people. Tamil guerrillas have been waging a guerrilla war and terrorist campaign since 1983 in their quest for a separate homeland, which they say is needed to combat what they call discrimination by the Sinahlese majority. More than 8,500 people, including at least 600 Indian peacekeeping soldiers, have died in the Tamil revolt. Most of the victims were Sinhalese civilians massacred in their villages or ambushed on buses and trains. The Sinhalese, who make up 75 percent of the population, dominate the government and the military.

 The feuding family of brain-damaged singer-composer <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON> has agreed to allow a judge to name an independent guardian to handle his affairs, another judge said Tuesday evening. Cuyahoga County Probate Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON> said <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON>'s family `` has gotten together'' and agreed to let Probate Court Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, name an independent guardian Under the agreement, the guardian must consult with family members before making major decisions for <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON>, who said relatives indicated a preference for naming as guardian a <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran like <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Bebe </PERSON>, and son, <PERSON> Thor </PERSON>, 24, had made competing appeals to be named guardian for <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON>, who was interviewed Monday night by <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Middleburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>. `` The responses were confusing,'' said <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON> repeatedly referred to this year as 1980 even after being told the correct date, the judge said. <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON>, 48, could name only two of his three children, <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON> is best known for his `` Ballad of the Green Berets,'' which was a hit in 1965. He reportedly lost 30 percent of his brain when he was wounded by gunfire last fall in <LOCATION> Guatamala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, where he had lived for five years. The nature of the attack has never been disclosed. A psychiatrist and psychologist, both of whom interviewed <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON> at the hospital, testified Tuesday at the guardianship hearing and were split on whether he was mentally competent. <PERSON> Gintautas </PERSON> <PERSON> Z. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabataitis </PERSON>, a psychologist from <ORGANIZATION> Parma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heights </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON> was competent but `` severely limited'' in his abilities and needed a guardian to look after his affairs. <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Lyndhurst </LOCATION> psychiatrist, said he had not determined whether <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON> was competent. `` I did n't reach a conclusion about that,'' he said. `` I had to leave it in the air.'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON> had suffered `` profound neurological loss'' but said he was surprised by <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON>'s capacities. <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON>'s mother, who moved to <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> to be close to her son, filed for guardianship after <PERSON> Thor </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON> was appointed guardian for his father by a judge in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON> was treated there for two months before coming to the <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> hospital Nov. 8.

<TEXT>
 The Directors Guild of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> on Monday announced its nominations for the prestigious DGA achievement award, marking the five directors as favorites for Academy Awards in March. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, who brought the controversial civil rights film `` Mississippi Burning'' to the screen, was one of the five nominated for outstanding directorial achievement in 1988. Also named were <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Crichton </PERSON>, director of the crime-caper comedy `` A Fish Called Wanda''; <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Levinson </PERSON>, who guided the autism film `` Rain Man''; <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Zemeckis </PERSON>, the creative force behind the animated, live action hit `` Who Framed Roger Rabbit''; and <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>, director of the corporate comedy `` Working Girl.'' Only three times in motion picture history has the <ORGANIZATION> DGA </ORGANIZATION> award winner failed to go on to win the Academy Award for best director. In 1985, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON> won the <ORGANIZATION> DGA </ORGANIZATION> honor for `` The Color Purple'' but <PERSON> Sydney </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> took the Academy Award for `` Out of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' The two other non-repeaters were <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> <PERSON> Coppola </PERSON> in 1972 when his `` Godfather'' lost to `` Cabaret'' and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> in 1968 when `` The Lion in Winter'' lost to `` <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Clint </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON>, who won a <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> for best director Saturday, was n't among the nominees, who are chosen by a vote of their peers. But `` Working Girl,'' which won four Golden Globes, and `` Rain Man,'' winner of two, both are in the running. `` I was hoping <PERSON> Clint </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON> would be nominated this year, but -LRB- his film `` Bird'' -RRB- was n't,'' said <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON>, who announced the nominations at a news conference at the <ORGANIZATION> DGA </ORGANIZATION> headquarters. `` I thought ` Bird' was an outstanding directorial accomplishment,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> DGA </ORGANIZATION> winner will be announced March 11 at the 41st annual <ORGANIZATION> DGA </ORGANIZATION> awards dinner-dance, to be held concurrently in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. All 9,000 members of the <ORGANIZATION> DGA </ORGANIZATION> were eligible to vote on the nominations, and all are eligible now to vote for the winner. The guild includes film and television directors and their assistants.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> intends to nominate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON>, currently Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, as the new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said Tuesday. <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> is the highest-ranking career foregin service officer at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. He succeeds former Sen. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Mansfield </PERSON>, who has retired. <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON>'s pending nomination was confirmed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sources who declined to named. He is a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and is also the ranking Asian specialist on the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> staff. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is due to visit <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for the Feb. 24 funeral of Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> relations with <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> are at a crucial stage, with pressure building in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to have the Japanese increase their contribution to the country's defense. Another problem in the relationship is the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit of $ 57 billion caused by an influx of Japanese products. But <PERSON> Mansfield </PERSON>, announcing his retirement late last year, said he was leaving with `` our heads high'' because the deficit had been narrowed as a result of hard bargaining to open Japanese markets and efforts to get <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to boost its domestic consumption as well as imports. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is also beset with domestic problems, including allegations that top politicians or their aides profited from shares in a real estate development firm by buying them before the firm was publicly traded. Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> will hold talks Thursday and Friday with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, Secretary of States <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> leaders. Under former Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> played a key role in dealing with Soviet authorities on regional disputes in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> southwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. An imposing 6-footer, <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> has a quiet demeanor and low-key style. Twenty years ago, he served in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> as a visiting professor of international relations at the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON>, 51, is a graduate of <ORGANIZATION> Carleton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. He is married and has three children. He is expected to be succeeded in the job of under secretary of state by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimmet </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is breaking precedent by not naming a career diplomat to the post, but <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON>, another former foreign service officer, is to be nominated Deputy Secretary of State. In another move, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is expected to name <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON>, former ambassador to the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, to the post of Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs. Late Tuesday, congressional sources said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is expected to pick <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON>, a Democrat, as assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs. A Democratic <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> source, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, said the choice had been made because <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON> was a moderate who could appeal to both Democrats and Republicans on divisive Central American policies, and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in particular. <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON> would succeed <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> in the post. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> became the lightning rod for the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> admistration's <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> policy, which was the longest-running dispute with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of his tenure. Meanwhile, a <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> source said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is expected to name <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Negroponte </PERSON>, deputy national security adviser, as ambassador to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Negroponte </PERSON>, a former ambassador to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, also has served in a variety of foreign postings, including in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Abba </PERSON> <PERSON> Eban </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s former foreign minister, on Tuesday rebutted accusations by a senior <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> official that the Jewish state is using Nazi methods to suppress the uprising in its occupied territories. The Monday statements by <PERSON> Bassam </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON>, a senior aide to <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, were `` intellectually ridiculous and morally outrageous,'' <PERSON> Eban </PERSON> told reporters. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eban </PERSON> spoke outside a privately sponsored conference on `` The Israeli-Palestinian Problem in European Perspective,'' which involves prominent figures from both <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. But both men's public addresses to the three-day gathering, which opened Tuesday, reflected a far more conciliatory mood and called for direct Israeli-PLO talks to end the <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> conflict. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> told a Monday news briefing that `` even the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> did not dare to implement several of the measures'' being used by Israeli troops to stop the 14-month uprising in the Israeli-occupied territories. So far, the uprising has cost the lives of at least 370 Palestinians _ including 47 killed by supposedly non-lethal Israeli plastic bullets _ and of 15 Israelis. `` Our people and our organization are suffering under organized state terrorism,'' <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> said. He charged that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had set up `` concentration camps'' for Palestinians that he compared to <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> death camp of World War II. <PERSON> Eban </PERSON> told reporters on Tuesday, `` That sort of rhetoric is going to be an obstacle to peace. ... It is a stupid thing to say.'' But he also noted that `` I notice that neither he -LRB- <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> -RRB- nor his colleagues used such language in our presence here today.'' Instead, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> official said in his conference address, `` We hope the future developments -LRB- in the <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> -RRB- will help to convince -LRB- Israeli premier <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> there is no other way to peace but to sit down and talk.'' Palestinians realize `` realize they can not build their future on the ruins of another people,'' <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> said. In his address, <PERSON> Eban </PERSON> told the conference that he believed the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s recent renunciation of terrorism and its acceptance of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist behind secure borders. `` If it is real, it would be reckless not to probe it and if it were a fraud, it would be important to expose'' the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> claims, <PERSON> Eban </PERSON> said. `` We must surely have reached the negotiating hour.''

 Real events are so outrageous these days that it sometimes seem satire and parody are n't possible. Then along comes `` The <ORGANIZATION> Kathy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Mo Show: Parallel Lives,'' at the off-Broadway Westside Arts Theater, proving that oblique looks at life can be surprising and hilarious. <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Najimy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaffney </PERSON> write and perform an evening of duet vignettes, much in the way that <PERSON> Lily </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomlin </PERSON> has done a series of solo character portraits. The show, which opened Tuesday night, is subtly feminist. It begins with the two women as angels deciding at the Creation how to organize the human race. They pick skin colors and worry that white people may feel inferior. They give men egos so they wo n't feel deprived while women bear the children. We check back with the angels at the start of Act 2. About the white people, <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> says, `` Do n't ask.'' She reports that `` the male ego thing certainly took off.'' The two women are expert at every character they present, young and old, women and men. Sometimes their sketches are deeply felt and poignant. One concerns the daily meeting in a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> bar of a married drunk who keeps proposing and a gallant, lonely woman who fears she'll never get what she needs to make her feel complete because she does n't know what it is <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> does one tender solo turn, as a woman whose favorite nephew admits he's homosexual. She gives up her wish for him to have a wife and children, and decides to remain his doting aunt. Some sketches are holdovers from `` The Further Adventures of <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mo </PERSON>,'' presented at the off-Broadway Second Stage in 1986. One new one, in which <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> dreams of being the perfect wife <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> sings about, with cuts to <PERSON> Mo </PERSON>, a prostitute talking to herself, does n't quite work. And the coda, in which many of the sketches' characters return for an instant, is more confusing than fun. But we laughed through almost all the evening, especially as the elderly <PERSON> Madeleine </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> shift gears adjusting to a meatless, fishless health-food restaurant, even donating to its cause _ `` Save the fish.'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedict </PERSON> directed. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Martel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Krass </PERSON> produce the <ORGANIZATION> Martel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Production </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> with </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Box </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinstock </PERSON>.

 The record cold air that stunned <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> swept into the lower 48 states Tuesday, dropping temperatures in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> by more than 70 degrees in less than a day, and the weather system keeping <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> cold intensified to a North American record. Blowing snow driven by winds gusting to over 100 mph in some areas dropped visibility to zero, closing schools in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and briefly shutting down a <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> highway. Balmy weather that set records for warmth in many cities ended abruptly in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, where Great Falls dropped to 10 degrees below zero Tuesday morning, after Monday's record high of 62, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Helena </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, plummeted from 44 degrees at 6 a.m. Tuesday to 6 below zero at 8 a.m. Wind chill factors plunged to near 80 degrees below zero in parts of the state and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Glacier </LOCATION> had 6 inches of snow by mid-morning, the weather service said. By afternoon much of the state was below zero. The agency issued a blizzard warning for the eastern slopes of the <ORGANIZATION> Rockies </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and warned: `` This is a very dangerous storm and anyone caught outdoors will be in grave danger in the warning areas.'' In the town of <LOCATION> Cut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, about 100 miles north of <PERSON> Helena </PERSON>, the temperature plunged 23 degrees in one minute, and 103 mph winds dropped the wind chill to 75 below zero. By 7 p.m., it was 22 degrees below zero. `` It was a drastic drop, really fast,'' said Glacier County undersheriff <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Barron </PERSON>. But ahead of the cold air, high temperature records were broken or tied Tuesday in 64 cities from <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and from northern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> into southern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Dodge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, soared to 80 degrees, surpassing the record of 76 set in 1911; <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> climbed to 65, breaking its 1877 record of 56; <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, hit 67, also breaking a 112-year-old record; <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> climbed to 60, breaking the mark of 54 degrees set in 1890; <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, reached 72; and <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Smith </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, hit 77. Cold air from <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> was trapped over <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> by a dome of extremely high atmospheric pressure. The barometer at <LOCATION> Northway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, rose to a record high of 31.74 inches of mercury, the weather service reported Tuesday. The previous North American record was Monday, at 31.54 inches at <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, which toppled the old record of 31.53 measured in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s Yukon Territory in January 1974. By contrast, hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> had the lowest recorded pressure in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION> at 26.22 inches on Sept. 13. `` This is the highest, coldest record-breaking system in the past 100 years,'' said meteorologist <PERSON> Wally </PERSON> <PERSON> Younker </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s overnight low was 62 below zero at Eagle and <LOCATION> Northway </LOCATION> near the Canadian border, and the wind chill in the <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> area fell to 80 below early Tuesday. Temperatures of minus 40 kept schools closed for a second day in Fairbanks and <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> ordered all non-essential state workers in the city to stay home until the cold spell snaps. Schools also were closed a second day in the <LOCATION> Matanuska-Susitna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> north of <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> because of wind chills to 50 below. Snow drifts up to 4 feet were reported at the intersection of the Parks and <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> highways. Heavy ice in <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Inlet </LOCATION> hampered barge traffic between <LOCATION> Nikiski </LOCATION> refineries and coastal villages that need fuel. <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION> chilled only to 11 below zero early Tuesday, but <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> asked people to conserve electricity to avoid rotating blackouts. An avalanche last week downed the power line to the city's hydroelectric dam, and one of the city's two auxiliary diesel-fired generators failed. The <ORGANIZATION> Montana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> advised emergency travel only Tuesday on most highways from <PERSON> Helena </PERSON> north to the Canadian border. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> authorities advised no travel in the northeastern part of the state, including Interstate 29, because of blowing and drifting snow. Twenty-six miles of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 2 in northwestern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> were closed by blinding, blowing snow. Wind gusting to 86 mph pushed ahead of the cold air crossing <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> on Tuesday, ripping porches from houses and destroying an empty mobile home, said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Lander </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, crews were in the process of restoring power to more than 100,000 customers in <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Snohomish </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Skagit </LOCATION> counties where high winds felled utility lines. Forecasters in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> said the Siberian blast could last until mid-February and predicted overnight lows this weekend of 20 to 40 below zero. High wind knocked down utility poles, cutting off power in scattered areas in northwestern <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and along the eastern slopes of the <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>, and utilities said their repair crews were struggling in the cold. `` They ca n't hardly stand to work in it,'' said <PERSON> Cal </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, line superintendent with <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co-op </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>. Some <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> schools stayed open Tuesday because they feared sending children back home in the bitter cold. School District 1 in <PERSON> Helena </PERSON> said children who could n't be taken directly home by bus or would be home alone would be taken back to school to await their parents. Some orchardists in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state fired up smudge pots to save the nation's largest cherry crop and the second-largest apricot crop, both of which were just beginning to bud. The state's fruit industry is worth $ 540 million. `` All that weather you have been reading about in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Yukon </PERSON> will plunge southward,'' warned weather service meteorologist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jannuzzi </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. No deaths or injuries directly attributable to the cold had been reported in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. There has been speculation, by the governor and others, that icy fog may have contributed to Sunday's crash of a Canadian military plane that killed eight men.

<HEAD>Party Leader Hints Major Leadership Changes Possible</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Communist Party chief said in an interview published Tuesday that a split in the party leadership is slowing reform and indicated high-level personnel changes are possible. <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>, reviewing the first 10 months of his tenure as party leader, said the leadership is `` waging a battle within ourselves'' which has slowed its ability to implement reform. Differing views are leading to a `` deterioration'' of the party's ability to implement reform, which could be grounds for personnel changes in the party elite, he told journalists from the government daily <ORGANIZATION> Magyar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hirlap </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Nepszabadsag </ORGANIZATION> If the party's policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> `` reaches the conclusion that the political committee -LRB- Politburo -RRB-, or the general secretary ... can not fulfill their tasks in this situation, it should draw the appropriate conclusions,'' <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> was quoted as saying. `` A leadership and a leader has to reckon with all this,'' he said in excerpts of the interview, carried by the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION>. In the same interview, <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> appeared to criticize <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON>, a member of the party's 11-member ruling Politburo. <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON>, one of the country's leading reformers, said in a weekend radio interview that the 1956 anti-communist revolt was not a counterrevolution, as officially termed for the past 30 years, but a popular uprising. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> said <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON>'s statement, based on work by a party committee he heads that is reviewing the country's past 40 year history, was premature. But in a television interview broadcast Monday evening, <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> could reach the same conclusion as <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON> `` if the facts justify it.'' Many of the demands voiced in the short-lived revolution, such as increased democracy, a multiparty system and opposition to a Stalinist-style leadership are reflected in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s reform process now.

<TEXT>
 One of two obstacles to low-power testing of the <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> nuclear power plant was cleared Tuesday when a federal board decided not to hold hearings on workers' performance during an emergency exercise. <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON>'s owners now can get their long-awaited low-power license if they prove that they can come up with $ 72.1 million to decontaminate and dismantle the reactor if it conducts the atomic tests but never operates commercially. The $ 5.8 billion Seabrook reactor was completed in July 1986 after years of delays and cost overruns. It remains idle because of evacuation-planning and financial obstacles. In a Dec. 21 ruling, the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> set two conditions for low-power testing: establishment of the decommissioning fund, and a decision by one of its licensing boards on whether to open hearings on plant workers' performance during the two-day exercise in June. <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> said Tuesday plant owners expect to submit a decommissioning-fund plan `` within the next couple of weeks.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Eichorn </PERSON>, chairman of the <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> owners' executive committee, said recently the owners are trying to buy a surety bond to meet the $ 72.1 million commitment. On procedural grounds, the licensing board Tuesday dismissed <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>'s request for the hearings, <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON> said. The plant is near the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> border, and six <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> communities lie within the plant's 10-mile evacuation plan. <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>'s request was based on an <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> staff inspection report dated July 15 but the request was not filed until Sept. 16. The licensing board said <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> waited too long to file the request. A spokeswoman for <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Breslauer </PERSON>, promised an appeal. `` Obviously we believe we were well within the legal time frame'' for filing the contention, she said. `` What we got -LRB- from <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> inspectors in July -RRB- was an initial report, very undetailed ... We did not get detailed backup reports until mid-August. Clearly until then we could n't file.'' The initial <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> inspection report said <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> control-room support staff displayed `` questionable engineering judgment'' and other shortcomings during a hypothetical accident under the exercise scenario. The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> concluded, however, that plant workers passed the test, which was part of a federal exercise of <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON>'s evacuation plans. <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> spokesman, said plant officials also had not yet seen the licensing board ruling, but `` it sounds like good news.'' Licensing delays last year forced the key <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> owner, <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION>, to seek bankruptcy protection, and other owners' finances also have become strained.

 A military refueling jet bound for <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> crashed in a ball of flames on takeoff Tuesday at <ORGANIZATION> Dyess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, killing all 19 people aboard, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said. Officials at K.I. Sawyer Air Force Base near <LOCATION> Marquette </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, where the flight originated, said the plane's passengers included spouses of military members or retired military members. The plane's crew `` never got it off the ground,'' said witness <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, 19. `` The first thing I saw was just the mushroom of the smoke.'' `` I heard the plane as it was coming down,'' said <PERSON> Skeet </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Abilene </LOCATION>. `` Engines were backfiring and missing. It curved off to the left and crashed. And then I saw the ball of smoke and fire go up.'' Initial reports fowarded to <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> commanders at the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> suggested the pilot of the plane experienced some kind of problem during his take-off roll, according to officials who spoke on condition they not be identified. `` It was toward the end of the roll and he apparently had no choice but to press on,'' said one source. `` But he did n't have the power to get up for some reason,'' added another. The wreckage burned for more than an hour after the crash. The plane came to rest tilted at about a 45 degree angle, a charred wing tipped toward the sky. Military search and rescue teams set up floodlights and searched into the night before the last two bodies were found, a base spokesman said. The flight manifest showed that 17 of those on board were from <ORGANIZATION> Sawyer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> and the other two boarded at <LOCATION> Dyess </LOCATION>, Master Sgt. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Dostal </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Dyess </LOCATION> said. The plane was en route from <LOCATION> Dyess </LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Hickam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> on a training mission, said <PERSON> Dyess </PERSON> <PERSON> Airman </PERSON> 1st Class Beverly Foster. The sources in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said the plane was carrying close to a full load of fuel totaling 155,000 pounds, including its own fuel and fuel to transfer during the flight to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> to some F-16 fighters flying across the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said the KC-135A tanker crashed at 12:10 p.m. near the south end of the <LOCATION> Dyess </LOCATION> runway, near <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Highway 277 about six miles southwest of <LOCATION> Abilene </LOCATION>. The maintenance record for the plane, powered by four <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> jet engines, was not yet available, said Lt. Col. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON>, a spokesman at <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Headquarters </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, Neb. There is no ejection system on the plane, built in 1963, said <PERSON> Peck </PERSON>. It was the second crash at <LOCATION> Dyess </LOCATION> in less than three months. A B-1B bomber crashed there Nov. 8. The four-man crew safely bailed out. The KC-135, dubbed the Stratotanker, is the backbone of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s refueling fleet. The aircraft, a military spin-off of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 707, normally takes a crew of four or five. It can carry a sizeable load of passengers even when carrying fuel. The military began using the first KC-135As in 1956. The tankers have a range of 1,150 miles while carrying 120,000 pounds of transfer fuel. They cost $ 20.1 million. A KC-135 crashed Oct. 11, 1988, at Wurtsmith Air Base near <LOCATION> Oscoda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>. That plane, also based at <LOCATION> Sawyer </LOCATION>, crashed and burst into flames on landing, killing six and injuring 10 An investigation into that crash has been completed, but <ORGANIZATION> SAC </ORGANIZATION> has not made it public.

 Employers and all but the poorest <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> would be taxed to finance a national health care system extending medical insurance to the estimated 37 million who lack coverage, under a plan proposed by a commission including three former presidents. The proposal encourages continued reliance on private health insurance provided through the workplace, but calls for a new program to provide universal access to basic medical services. Costs would be spread among employers and all Americans above 150 percent of poverty level. The plan offered Monday is designed to extend medical coverage to all Americans, stem the growth of medical expenses which now stand at $ 550 billion annually, and improve the quality of medical care nationwide, said the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION>, which worked 2 -LCB- years preparing its proposal. `` If we continue the present trend, the $ 550 billion will double in six years and triple in 12 years,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> congressman from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> who co-chaired the commission with former <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, a Republican.

<HEAD>Epic McMurtry Western Turned into Four-Day Event for CBS</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Durn </PERSON>. Just when you write off the whole danged network season, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> comes along with a big ol' event, a four-night masterpiece of a Western, `` Lonesome Dove.'' The eight-hour miniseries begins Sunday and runs through Wednesday. Readers who loved <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> McMurtry </PERSON>'s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel can be assured that <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> screenwriter <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Witliff </PERSON> has transformed it into a film that enlightens rather than obscures the heart of it. For viewers who have n't read the novel, the movie stands on its own. It's proof that the miniseries is still a worthwhile genre for epics like `` Lonesome Dove'' that ca n't be contained in a two-hour film. The cast is virtually unprecedented for a network movie _ Oscar-winners <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvall </PERSON> -LRB- `` Tender Mercies'' -RRB- and <PERSON> Anjelica </PERSON> <PERSON> Huston </PERSON> -LRB- `` Prizzi's Honor'' -RRB-, plus <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, D.B. <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON>, <PERSON> Frederic </PERSON> <PERSON> Forrest </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Urich </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroder </PERSON>, <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Glenne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Headly </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanderson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Witliff </PERSON> wrote `` Raggedy Man'' and `` Country'' and co-wrote `` The Black Stallion.'' Director <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Wincer </PERSON>'s credits include `` Phar Lap'' and the network miniseries `` Bluegrass.'' But the miniseries belongs to <PERSON> Duvall </PERSON>. Well, the book did belong to <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> <PERSON> McCrae </PERSON>. <PERSON> Duvall </PERSON>, an actor who becomes his role, has found in coot-philosopher <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> a character who becomes the actor just as much. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> -LRB- with his hair dyed white -RRB- holds his own with <PERSON> Duvall </PERSON>, no mean feat. He has perhaps a more difficult role, as the simmering, taciturn Call. <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> and Call are legendary ex-Texas Rangers reduced to running a down-at-the-heels cattle outfit along the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION>, just outside a wide spot in the road called Lonesome Dove. When old companero <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Spoon </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Urich </PERSON> -RRB- shows up after 10 years, running from a fatal misunderstanding in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, he's full of tales of a cattleman's paradise in a wilderness called <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. Call, without Indians and outlaws to keep his mind off the ghosts of his past, figures an adventure is just what he needs, and he's soon rounded up 2,600 head of Mexican cattle and an inexperienced bunch of hands and headed off on a 3,000-mile trail drive <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> is usually satisfied to sit on the porch avoiding work, swigging whiskey and expounding loudly on any subject that happens to come up. But he goes along hoping to see his true love, <PERSON> Clara </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Huston </PERSON> -RRB-, who is married to a horsetrader in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> trails along with <PERSON> Lorie </PERSON> -LRB- Lane -RRB-, a young prostitute who believes his promise to take her to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> sheriff <PERSON> July </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> -RRB- embarks reluctantly on a mission to bring <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> to justice. He is soon distracted, though, by the news that his wife -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Headly </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- has run off. She, too, is bound for <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, and an outlaw she still loves. Along the way, the cowboys tangle with sandstorms, stampedes, horse thieves and Indians. <PERSON> Lorie </PERSON> is stolen by Blue Duck -LRB- Forrest -RRB-, a vicious renegade who duels with <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> and meets an unusual demise. <PERSON> Witliff </PERSON> did an exceptional job of turning <PERSON> McMurtry </PERSON>'s vivid but often introspective 840-page book into a film, preserving the dialogue and improving the ending by a simple rearrangement of minor events. Much of the violence and raunchiness of the book remains, though toned down for network TV. When <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> is under attack by Indians on the open plains, he stabs his horse to death to use him for cover. <PERSON> Wincer </PERSON> occasionally lapses into unnecessary slo-mo melodrama. But only occasionally. The action sequences are mostly superb. Set designer <PERSON> Cary </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> has turned the `` Lonesome Dove'' of imagination into a reality. And <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Milsome </PERSON>'s cinematography is evocative without being too darned purty. Witliff telescopes many events, so the miniseries gets going much more quickly than the book. By the end of the first night, the trail drive is under way and the first fatality has occurred at the <LOCATION> Nueces </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. By then, any viewer with a pulse should be hooked. In exchange for the quicker pace, the miniseries shucks some of the character development of the book. There's no way around that unless the network stretched the miniseries into a week. After four nights, viewers might wish that they had.

<TEXT>
 The gunfire comes from a passing car, exploding just after the shouted gang slogans _ battle cries on the urban killing fields where the medics move in to pick up the pieces. In the darkness, sometimes with the gunmen still looking on from the sanctuary of a gathering crowd, the paramedics move in. They ignore red and blue gang colors and tattoos, tending wounds sometimes reminiscent of war, radioing ahead to an emergency room already overcrowded with the city's poor. There, an ER doctor will treat yet another victim of the violence that claimed 351 lives in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> last year. Suburban counties are beginning to mount their own tolls. For <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> fire paramedics like <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Siefert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinney </PERSON> the victims and shootings blur together. Only the most brutal stand out. For <PERSON> Siefert </PERSON>, that was a bloody morning at <LOCATION> Gage </LOCATION> and Rugby avenues in <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, a primarily Hispanic suburb where downtown highrises loom in the distance like mirages of prosperity. The attack was retaliatory. The victim was the mother of a gang member, shot in the stomach with a shotgun. `` They assassinate one another,'' <PERSON> Siefert </PERSON> said. Sometimes the killers do n't flee, forcing paramedics to work under the eye of gang toughs who <PERSON> Kinney </PERSON> said often `` walk right back up and watch; see if they killed them or not.'' Sometimes paramedics must watch victims bleed, waiting until police secure the area. The <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will not even allow its paramedics to be interviewed for fear that the attention will put them at risk. In the heart of the violence is <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Luther </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jr.-Drew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, near <LOCATION> Watts </LOCATION> amid neighborhoods claimed by the Bloods and Crips black street gangs. The most common operation at the hospital is an exploratory laparotomy, to repair damage from a gunshot wound. In 1986, there were 754 such operations _ nearly four times the number of appendectomies, said Dr. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>, chairman of surgery. `` You give it your 102 percent and you patch them up and you send them out to start the vicious cycle all over again,'' said <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Allmond </PERSON>, the hospital's trauma nurse coordinator. Police Chief <PERSON> Daryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> has likened street warfare to conflicts in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. With attackers here favoring <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> submachineguns and AK-47 assault rifles, those on the front line know the references to war are not so far-fetched. `` The trauma is exactly the same,'' said <PERSON> Kinney </PERSON>. Doctors say they see more shotgun and small-caliber handgun wounds than those from Uzis. But they do n't diminish the violence. `` They'll say to you if their loved one dies, ` You're going to get more business tonight' ... and the retaliation sets in,'' Ms. <PERSON> Allmond </PERSON> said. Gang members 10 at a time have stormed emergency room doors at King to get to the wounded. `` There were times the gang members walked in ER and our doctors were shaking in their boots,'' said <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>. The violence did not always rate front-page headlines and top-of-the-hour newscasts. But on Jan. 30, 1988 <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Toshima </PERSON> _ a 27-year-old <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> woman who could have been anyone from the comfortable suburbs _ was slain by gang crossfire while strolling through <LOCATION> Westwood </LOCATION>, the upscale district of shops, restaurants and theaters near the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. With that began <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>' 1,000-officer task force nicknamed `` The Hammer,'' which rounded up hundreds of reputed gang toughs; the so-called gang summits with local ministers that brought a call for jobs but no end to the shootings; and the `` city under seige'' news stories. <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>, a former military man, says the solution is a job corps, combining work and discipline for gang members. But he believes police sweeps have had some success quelling violence. The day after a weekend sweep that netted 870 arrests, `` we had one death in one 17-year-old and other than that it was relatively quiet.'' The teen who died bore the <ORGANIZATION> MSC </ORGANIZATION> tattoo, initials of the Main Street Crips. He was slain by a bullet that clipped the main vessel leading into the bottom of the heart. Hundreds survive the violence. Some come to <ORGANIZATION> Rancho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amigos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> for rehabilitation. In the hallway, Dr. <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, director of the adult brain injury unit, passes a zombie-like young man, who shuffles slowly, eyes focusing loosely when <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> says hello. The man was a bystander to a gang fight. Bullet fragments hit him in the arm and head, leaving him with nerve injury and extreme pain. He had been attending college; now he can write, but no longer knows how to read. Stone estimated 10 percent to 15 percent of his patients bear gang-related injuries. Dr. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Garland </PERSON>, director of the spinal cord injury unit, where the primary cause of injury is gunshot wounds, puts the number near 35 percent. These men have seen patients unable to move because of gang-related injuries, patients who will need wheelchairs the rest of their lives, but still retain gang affiliations. `` We've had patients who have refused a red or a blue wheelchair,'' said county social worker <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>' one `` success story'' is an 18-year-old who was shot during his gang initiation about two years ago. The gang provided the target, and Ms. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> believes it was a setup. The target was an undercover policeman, who drew his weapon and shot the boy, leaving him without the use of his legs. The teen-ager has earned his high school diploma, moved into his own place and is starting community college. He wrote to thank Ms. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> for her friendship and help in beginning a life without his legs. Then added, `` But if that is what it cost for me to change my ways and find good friend it worth it.'' For others, there are few bright spots. Dr. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON>, director of emergency admitting at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> County-USC Medical Center, sees more than a dozen gang victims, most under the age of 25, come through hospital doors each week. `` If they're 7 or 8, we assume they're innocent,'' <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> said. `` Otherwise we lose all hope.''

For many, it's the first time since the war that they've felt free to cry. `` Some of these people have n't felt in years,'' said <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON>, manager of nurses for the post-traumatic stress disorder program at the Veterans' Hospital at <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION>, herself a <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran. `` The fact that some of these people are still sane is remarkable. PTSD is treatable, but it takes time,'' <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> said. An estimated 470,000 of the 3.14 million vets who served in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> suffer from PTSD and 80 percent of those never have sought mental help, said <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Scurfield </PERSON>. His is one of 14 relatively new programs in this country trying to help PTSD victims. Three percent of its participants served in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and World War II, the rest in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. In the company of other vets and a professional staff of 23 that includes 13 veterans, men who never quite left the war behind tell of sleepless nights, flashbacks, guilt over having killed, guilt over having survived, uncontrolled anxiety and rage and the isolation they feel. Holding hands, they ride in <LOCATION> Huey </LOCATION> helicopters in maneuvers similar to those commonly used in the war. The sound of the rotors and rush of wind was enough for one to tearfully recall his last flight in a <PERSON> Huey </PERSON>, a trip that ended in an ambush and the deaths of 18 of the 35 men in his squad. Some go on an Outward Bound trip and push their limits in rapids in search of new perspectives on their abilities and their lives. Many vets are hearing for the first time that it's human to feel what they feel, and that anyone who has experienced severe trauma _ the Holocaust, for example, or even major earthquakes _ can feel the same way. And it's the first time many have let go _ the birth of a long period of healing, forgiveness, learning to live with memories, trusting themselves and others, and hoping for the future. `` They're digging things out of me here that I did n't even know were issues,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, 42, of <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>. `` You look at somebody and see them blown to hell, and they're not there. `` It's a convenient way not to make friends, because I'm afraid of them dying ... I avoid people ... for that and other reasons. `` That's the nice thing about this place. They confront you on it and you have to face what's going on inside of you.'' <PERSON> Scurfield </PERSON> said any victim of severe trauma can develop chronic symptoms that can include intrusive imagery, numbing, helplessness, fear that leads to rage, fear that leads to grief, anger against authority and `` the system,'' inability to control emotions and actions, broken relationships and work histories, depression, anxiety, hypervigilance and sleeping disorders. They sometimes express those symptoms and other times avoid expression altogether, as they probably did at the time the trauma took place. This leads to physical and emotional isolation and confusion over personal responsibility, self-worth, relationships, work _ even play. The 11-week program at <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, begun in 1985, has served 350 so far, and has an eight-month waiting list. Applicants must have served in a war zone, have received some counseling already, and be drug - and alcohol-free It costs the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> $ 107 per day per patient. Participants learn about controlling anger, anxiety and stress and about substance abuse and PTSD. They also examine pre-war experiences that may have contributed to their war reaction; war-zone trauma; and their post-war years. They even look at the benefits of trauma: intense comradeship, emotional and spiritual insights, and heightened sensitization to life's horrors and to political behavior, <PERSON> Scurfield </PERSON> said. `` By going back to the wound, you finally realize that you have to feel the pain, the grief, the loss, before the wound is actually healed,'' said <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Horst </PERSON>, 42, of <LOCATION> Sequim </LOCATION>. `` You'll always have the scar, but at least you have acceptance and forgiveness.'' All are encouraged to attend outpatient counseling for six months to three years to consolidate gains made while in the program, <PERSON> Scurfield </PERSON> says. Failure to do that can easily mean backsliding and renewed isolation. Vets listen carefully when <PERSON> Scurfield </PERSON> explains how their anger probably stems from fear. How they had to go to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> at a time when they would have been undergoing a lot of change anyway and so were especially vulnerable. How they're the only ones who can change the crazy life patterns. `` The rage is justified, but you still need to let go of it,'' <PERSON> Scurfield </PERSON> said. `` If how you're going to feel or what you're going to do is determined by someone else, you're not in control ... I'm not saying do n't fight, you must ... not let the symptoms control you Open a valve and release some of it without hurting yourself.'' The understanding and definition of the disorder continues to evolve. How successful American Lake and PTSD treatment are is anybody's guess without a better follow-up system and more coordination among the 14 programs, said <PERSON> Scurfield </PERSON>, a doctor of social work who did psychiatric work in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. A lot more money and programs are needed, especially in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Scurfield </PERSON> testified before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last summer. Special emphasis should be placed on professional support for veteran self-help groups in geographically isolated areas, where many choose to live because of low, fixed incomes. Scurfield lays the delayed response in identifying and treating PTSD _ a disorder professionals now believe has always existed among trauma victims _ to naive psychology trends, right-wing beliefs that common knowledge of PTSD would undermine the country's ability to defend itself, and concerns over the immense potential financial strain of treatment. In a recent survey sent to 180 <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> graduates and answered by 85, a majority had been helped in self-esteem, relationships, and understanding they have the responsibility and ability to change. But a significant minority reported no real change in depression and anxiety, relationships and intrusive symptoms. `` I definitely needed another tuneup and more time,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Fairfield </PERSON>, 39, of rural northeast <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. `` It took me 20 years to get as screwed up as I was ... If they had helped me 20 years ago, I would n't be here. The program should be longer.'' Ten percent of participants have returned once, <PERSON> Scurfield </PERSON> said. Despite its admitted weaknesses, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Petty </PERSON>, a VA social worker in <LOCATION> Loma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Linda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and a member of a congressionally mandated <ORGANIZATION> PTSD </ORGANIZATION> committee, says <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> is considered on the cutting edge of treatment. `` These people know what's going on,'' said <LOCATION> Fairfield </LOCATION>. `` When I wake up at 3 a.m. drenched in sweat and have to talk, they're there. It's the only program with a special support group for children of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> vets, and it's the only one that incorporates the helicopter rides. `` I was trying to make sense out of nonsense,'' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, 36, of <LOCATION> Olympia </LOCATION>. `` I felt I was the only person who felt that way. `` This program ... gave me a chance to work on issues and stop from hitting bottom ... I have to pick myself up, and live.''

<HEAD>The Rape of Rosebud: Colorizing ``Citizen Kane''</HEAD>

 `` Mr. <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> was a man who got everything he wanted, and then lost it. Maybe <PERSON> Rosebud </PERSON> was something he could n't get, or something he lost.

 If <LOCATION> Orson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Welles </LOCATION> were alive today, he would likely be fuming about `` goats and monkeys.'' That's how the celebrated filmmaker of `` Citizen Kane'' often referred to <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> studio executives who tampered with his movies. It was a line from <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s `` Othello,'' and <PERSON> Welles </PERSON> was indeed a classicist and a genius. But despite his artistry and the acclaim he received after his brilliant work on 1941's `` Citizen Kane'' _ considered by many to be the greatest movie ever made _ he was never able to direct another <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> film without major interference from the front office. <PERSON> Welles </PERSON>, who died in 1985, often boasted that it was the only film that was never taken away from him. But even `` Citizen Kane'' is no longer immune to tampering. <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which infuriated filmmakers and movie buffs by colorizing `` Casablanca'' and `` It's a Wonderful Life'' among others, has announced plans to give <PERSON> Welles </PERSON>' classic the same treatment. Television entrepreneur <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> acquired the rights to the movie in 1985 when he bought <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> with its massive film library for $ 1.5 billion. Directors, including <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, the late <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Huston </PERSON> and <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, and such actors as <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, took their fight against colorization to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, pushing for legislation to create a national film commission with powers over the color-enhancement computerized process. They have long argued that the process often destroys the original work of art, changing mood and intent. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> has long argued that he's merely protecting his investment by tapping into a new audience for old movies of the 1930s and'40s _ young people who grew up on color TV. `` I like things in color. We see in color,'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said. `` I'm colorizing ` Casablanca' just for controversy's sake Once people start watching the colored version, they wo n't bother with the original.'' However, while <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> presents his color versions on his two cable-TV networks, other commercial networks continue to show the black-and-white originals and attract large audiences. And colorized films have had only moderate success in video sales, according to <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Erol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest independent video chain Sales figures for 1988 show that the colorized version of `` It's a Wonderful Life,'' by far the biggest seller, sold 2,000 units at the retail price of $ 8.95 For the black-and-white version, 10,705 sales, retailing at $ 4.95, were reported. Few colorized films are available for rentals. `` There's a market for both,'' <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON> acknowledged. `` I think you have to keep in mind what's out there. Most of the young people grew up in a colored world while film buffs and afficionados want the originals.'' While two companies are coloring test scenes of `` Citizen Kane'' to see if the process is even feasible on the movie, critics continue to fume. `` It's nothing short of criminal. They're tampering with a masterpiece,'' said director <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wise </PERSON>, who helped edit `` Citizen Kane.'' `` If he -LRB- <LOCATION> Welles </LOCATION> -RRB- were alive today, he would be at somebody's throat He would be bombasting all over the place.'' While `` Citizen Kane'' made headlines at first when a brash, young <PERSON> Welles </PERSON> parodied the life of newspaper magnate <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearst </PERSON>, it is an unchallenged, magnificent work of art and technology because of its innovative use of lighting, camera and sound. While many movies had been made in color by 1941, notably `` Gone With the Wind,'' `` The Wizard of Oz'' and `` A Star Is Born,'' Welles considered black-and-white essential to setting the proper mood for his film. `` Orson always said a black-and-white film abstracts reality,'' recalled <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Leaming </PERSON>, who collaborated with <PERSON> Welles </PERSON> on his autobiography. `` The words he always used for <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> were ` hallucinatory' and ` dreamlike.' He said it created a mood several steps removed from the real world. `` For <LOCATION> Orson </LOCATION>, black-and-white was one the things that gave ` Citizen <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>' the possibility of being an art film. He said all of the elements were conceived in the same way. If you change one element, all of the other elements are going to look wrong.'' Although <PERSON> Welles </PERSON> had never made a feature film before signing a contract with <ORGANIZATION> RKO </ORGANIZATION> in 1939, he was already famous. In 1938, his notorious `` War of the Worlds'' radio broadcast convinced thousands of people that Martians had landed in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. His innovative stage productions with the Mercury Theatre and his work with <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION>'s Negro Theatre, including an all-black presentation of `` Macbeth,'' made him the talk of <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION>. He considered several sources for his first film. He had originally attempted an adaptation of <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>'s short novel, `` The Heart of Darkness'' -LRB- later a source for <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Coppola </PERSON>'s `` Apocalypse Now'' -RRB-, but the start of World War II in 1939 endangered the film's success in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, a market considered vital by RKO He also looked into making a comedy starring <PERSON> Carole </PERSON> <PERSON> Lombard </PERSON> or <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> and a Mexican melodrama based on a novel by <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Calder-Marshall </PERSON> but then came up with on another idea based on conversations with his friend, <PERSON> Ashton </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, a drama critic for the Hearst-owned <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> American. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> had intrigued <PERSON> Welles </PERSON> with his depictions of <ORGANIZATION> Hearst </ORGANIZATION>, whose parties at his <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Simeon </LOCATION> castle and extra-marital affair with the actress <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Davies </PERSON> were the talk of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>. Welles and <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Mankiewicz </PERSON> put together a script that chronicled the life of a newspaper tycoon and would-be politician, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>, who dies a lonely man after his attempts to make an opera singer out of his wife, <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, destroy his personal and professional life. -LRB- They won the Academy Award for best screenplay. -RRB- The film's plot centered on a reporter's efforts to determine the meaning of the dying <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>'s final word, `` Rosebud.'' For those who never saw the movie, <PERSON> Rosebud </PERSON> was the name of his sled. <ORGANIZATION> Hearst </ORGANIZATION> was the main source for `` Citizen Kane'' but <PERSON> Welles </PERSON> also drew upon the lives of obert <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON>, a wealthy <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> businessman who had himself tried to promote an untalented opera singer, and <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Infull </PERSON>, who had built an opera house in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Instead of a straightforward narrative, `` Citizen Kane'' jumps back and forth in time as the reporter interviews people who knew <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> and newsreels depict the highlights of his public life. It is similar in structure to `` Marching Song,'' a play <PERSON> Welles </PERSON> wrote when he was 17, based on a reporter's search for the abolitionist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. `` <LOCATION> Orson </LOCATION> was fascinated by a story within a story,'' said <PERSON> Leaming </PERSON>, a professor of theater and film at <ORGANIZATION> Hunter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. `` ` Citizen <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>' was a logical development.

 Welles cast himself as <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> and also used several of the old Mercury players, including <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cotten </PERSON>, <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Sloane </PERSON> and <PERSON> Agnes </PERSON> <PERSON> Moorehead </PERSON>. To compose the soundtrack, he hired <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrmann </PERSON>, who would later work with <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitchcock </PERSON> on `` Vertigo,'' `` North by <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'' and several other films. But the most important member of the `` Citizen Kane'' crew was cinematographer <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> <PERSON> Toland </PERSON>, whose credits included `` Wuthering Heights'' and `` How Green Is My Valley.'' <PERSON> Toland </PERSON>, anxious for the chance to try out new techniques, had requested to work for Welles. `` <PERSON> Toland </PERSON> was the single greatest cinematographer of all time,'' Wise said. `` He was a master in every way.'' <PERSON> Toland </PERSON> and <PERSON> Welles </PERSON> made extensive use of deep-focus photography, which by putting the entire frame of a picture into focus, allowed several points of view to be shown simultaneously. Deep-focus had been used by silent film director <PERSON> D.W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> but was largely discontinued in 1925 when a new type of film stock made the effect technically unfeasible. By the late'30s, however, the quality of film had improved enough to allow again for deep-focus, and <LOCATION> Welles </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Toland </PERSON> used it to stunning effect. In one scene, <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>'s parents sign an agreement to place young <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> under the guardianship of <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, a cold-hearted <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> banker. <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>'s father is seen at the left side of the frame and his mother is in closeup at the right with <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> leaning over her shoulder. In the background, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> is seen playing outside in the snow. Because everyone in the frame is shot in focus, the viewer can appreciate how many people are affected by what has taken place. In another scene, <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> is taking a singing lesson from <LOCATION> Matisti </LOCATION>, a prominent teacher. The lesson is obviously going badly and <LOCATION> Matisti </LOCATION> is clearly frustrated by <PERSON> Susan </PERSON>'s hopelessly off-key singing. An increasingly impatient <PERSON> Matisti </PERSON> is seen in the left side of the frame, a clearly uncomfortable <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> sings on the right side, and in the far background, <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>, in sharp focus, enters the room and angrily advances to the piano. Again, several points of view are expressed in one frame. Welles often shot <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> from floor level to make him appear larger and demonstrate his dominance over other people. In one of the film's final scenes, when <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>'s marraige is rapidly falling apart, Welles uses camera angles to underline the relationship of the couple. <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> is shot from below as he listens to <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> scream, and is viewed from above when he responds, making him tower over her. The shadow he casts obscures her. Ceilings had rarely been seen in a Hollywood film until Welles put them on camera in `` Citizen Kane'' by using extreme up-angle shots. `` I suppose that closing the top of a set was the real revolution we caused,'' Welles once said. `` It's disastrous to let a camera light a set without a ceiling _ it's artificial.'' Before `` Citizen Kane,'' filmgoers' main exposure to newsreels had been <ORGANIZATION> Hearst </ORGANIZATION>'s `` March of Time'' clips, which offered hyped-up versions of current events. Because of an intricate technical process, the newsreels in `` Citizen Kane'' had the same `` grainy'' look as the <ORGANIZATION> Hearst </ORGANIZATION> films. `` What I had to do was take all the film <LOCATION> Orson </LOCATION> shot and degrain it,'' Wise said. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, manager of public relations for SuperStation <ORGANIZATION> TBS </ORGANIZATION>, said a company to do the coloring has not yet been hired and could not determine what would be done with the newsreel footage. Shooting for `` Citizen Kane'' began in June of 1940 and was completed in late October. The film premiered in May 1941 at the Palace Theatre in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and received rave reviews except from papers controlled by the outraged <ORGANIZATION> Hearst </ORGANIZATION>. `` On seeing it for the first time, one got a conviction that if the cinema could do that, it could do anything,'' said film critic <PERSON> Penelope </PERSON> <PERSON> Houston </PERSON>. Welles' next film, `` The Magnificent Ambersons,'' was reduced by RKO from 131 minutes to 88 minutes after a disastrous screening. By 1948, <PERSON> Welles </PERSON> was working for <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which specialized in film vehicles for such cowboy stars as <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Autry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>. He would have only sporadic success the rest of his life. `` I began at the top and have been making my way down ever since,'' <PERSON> Welles </PERSON> said. In the mid-1970s, <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinger </PERSON>, an electronic equipment designer from <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, began experimenting with the process of converting black-and-white film to color. `` The black-and-white film is transferred to one-inch videotape,'' <PERSON> Weinger </PERSON> said. `` A computer operator picks out key frames from each individual scene and by using an electronic light pencil assigns color values to the actors and objects. Then the computer takes over and colors all the other frames in the scene. `` A minute of the scene can be colored in one hour. A 100-minute movie can be completed in a day and a half.'' The average cost for colorizing a movie is $ 183,000. The first job for <PERSON> Weinger </PERSON>'s process was the 1978 TV docu-drama, `` King.'' Filmways could find no color footage of the 1963 March on <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to interweave with the dramatized <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, Jr., story. <PERSON> Weinger </PERSON> provided four minutes of the March in color. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> heard about the process and hired <PERSON> Weinger </PERSON> to color a half-hour of World War II newsreels for `` Ike,'' the biography of <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>. Turner Entertainment issued its first colorized version of a Hollywood classic in 1986 with `` Yankee Doodle Dandy.'' `` They go back to the original black-and-white negative and make it sure it's in the best possible condition. It's then transfrerred to video tape. We never touch the negative,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. `` The corporation has a team of researchers who study everything available about the film. They talk to people around at the time. They also study the styles of Technicolor of the period. Their research is pretty exhaustive.'' The colorization of films has also meant that high-quality prints for the black-and-white versions are now available. In February, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Biograph Theatre, a leading revival house, will be starting a `` Tribute to <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION>,'' showing brand new prints of `` Citizen Kane'' and `` Casablanca'' among others. `` The Turner people are very good, first class,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowley </PERSON>, program director of the Biograph. `` I play the pictures as they're meant to be played.'' For Welles, who was working on an adaptation of `` King Lear'' at the time of his death, films were meant to played in black-and-white. <PERSON> Leaming </PERSON> recalled that even in the'80s, he had an aversion to filming in color. `` He knew that the pressure of the market became too strong, that people wanted color films,'' <PERSON> Leaming </PERSON> said. `` He would say, ` I'll put a color prolog on ` King <PERSON> Lear </PERSON>' and fool them. They'll give me the money and then I'll shoot it in black-and-white the way it should be.'''

 Americans' after-tax incomes shot up 3.8 percent last year, but the cost of employer-sponsored health care jumped 18.6 percent, according to new reports. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Monday the gain in income, adjusted for inflation, was the best since a 3.9 percent gain in 1986 and more than double 1987's 1.7 percent. Some of the extra money went to raise the nation's personal savings rate from the 40-year low of a year earlier. Analysts said the report stirred some inflationary concern in the bond market but was largely shrugged off by <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, where the Dow Jones industrial average edged up 1.25 points to 2,324.11, its highest close since the market crash in October 1987.

The average cost per employee of health care plans was $ 2,354 in 1988, up from $ 1,985 in 1987, according to the survey of more than 1,600 employers, whose plans cover 10 million workers and dependents. In December, personal income totaled $ 4.2 trillion, with much of the $ 37.1 billion jump from November resulting from farm subsidy payments. Without those outlays, the government said, December's total income would have been up 0.8 percent Last year's income gains spurred both spending and savings. Consumer spending rose 2.8 percent after adjusting for inflation, following increases of 2.7 percent in 1987 and 4.3 percent in 1986. In December alone, spending rose 0.9 percent, with the biggest increase, 4.1 percent, posted for durable goods _ `` big ticket'' items expected to last three or more years. Meanwhile, the average personal savings rate rose a full percentage point, from 3.2 percent to 4.2 percent, the highest since the 4.4 percent set in 1985. The 1987 rate was the smallest since a 3.1 percent rate in 1947. Economists said the figures were a good sign for continued economic strength in the coming year. `` There's a balanced picture for consumers, with a strong increase in income, a solid increase in spending and some increase in savings,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist for the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` All three of those ... are quite desirable if the expansion is going to keep on rolling along.''

<TEXT>
 Face to face at last with the big savings and loan issue, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s private and public leaders will writhe in pain as they seek a way out of the mess, hoping to disguise the pain or dissipate it most broadly. The fact is, however, that no such effort can help society avoid paying the cost of bailing out insolvent thrifts, estimates of which seem to be at a rock - bottom low of $ 20 billion and an uncapped high of more than $ 100 billion It matters not what you call the vehicle for raising the money _ a tax, a fee or an increase in insurance premiums _ it is inevitable that a large number of ordinary Americans are going to pay for it. There is no other way. It matters not, for example, who the culprits are or what they did or the injustice of it all. You can jail the culprits, but you can not transform mismanagers into financial geniuses who can earn back and pay what they lost. The pain may be hidden in business assessments, but business sooner or later passes on its costs to customers. There's no way Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> can pay, since he has hardly a dime in his pockets that you, taxpayers, did n't give him. So testy is this matter, that it threatens to end President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s honeymoon abruptly. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal calls for a 25-cent a year fee for every $ 100 on deposits at banks, credit unions and, of course, savings and loans. Clearly, it has flaws. It might, for instance, unfairly penalize smaller institutions and their depositors while allowing operators of large money market funds to escape. Conceivably, money could flow from one to the other. But any proposal that is offered is likely to be flawed and subject to criticism as unfair. Recognizing this, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON>, professor of economics, authority on savings and loans, and dean of <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, offers this defense of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal: `` Our problem is simply this: We failed to accurately forecast or anticipate the insurance liability for the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L So, we charged too low a premium to cover the insurance claims. `` Now, we need a surcharge that amounts to 25 cents per $ 100 of deposits. It means that if you have $ 100 in your local bank paying 5 percent interest you will get $ 4.75 rather than $ 5 for every $ 100 of savings.'' <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON> cites state automobile insurance charges as roughly comparable. `` During the 18 months I have lived in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, this has happened a number of times to my automobile insurance. Liabilities for uninsured and high - risk state insurance program were dramatically underestimated `` As a result, we were ` taxed,' if you wish to use that word, to make up the shortfall in the past premiums that had been charged. `` I may be unhappy with the insurance premium boost, incensed over rumors of mismanagement, poor planning, fraud and other factors that produced the huge insurance deficit, but I can not solve any of those problems by refusing to pay the ` one-time' additional charge on my premium to remove the deficit _ claims now owed by the insurance system to thousands of innocent motorists.'' The S & amp; L situation, he maintains, `` is no different.'' Many people affected to one degree or another will challenge that assertion, and the entire proposal might be abandoned for another that, in turn, is likely to be severely criticized. The issue is basic and painful, one that touches on the phrase `` we the people,'' so often cited to express pride in participatory government. Most often the reference is in regard to inherent rights. The rest of the definition defines obligations.

<HEAD>Health-Care Plan Costs Rise 18.6 Percent In 1988</HEAD>

 The lid on the cost of health-care plans popped off in 1988 as the expense per worker of employer-sponsored programs shot up 18.6 percent, a new survey says. The jump came after two years of moderate increases _ 7.7 percent in 1986 and 7.9 percent in 1987 _ and `` there does n't appear to be much relief in sight,'' according to a report released Monday by A. <ORGANIZATION> Foster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Higgins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a New York-based benefits consulting firm. Health insurers swallowed some of the unexpected cost increases last year and will pass them along this year, ensuring another stiff rise, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Erb </PERSON>, the managing consultant who conducted the survey. The average cost per employee of health care plans was $ 2,354 in 1988, up from $ 1,985 in 1987, according to the survey of more than 1,600 employers, whose plans cover a total of 10 million workers and dependents. The figures include the cost of plans to both employers and employees. The medical-care component of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Consumer Price Index rose 6.9 percent last year, making it the fastest-growing part of the inflation measure. But the cost of services is only part of the problem for employers and employees, <PERSON> Erb </PERSON> said. According to <PERSON> Erb </PERSON>, these were some of the factors in last year's big jump: _ Expensive medical services such as heart and liver transplants are becoming more widely available, so more people are using _ The federal and state governments, strapped for money, are holding down how much they pay health-care providers for <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> and Medicaid patients That forces the providers to raise their prices to other customers. _ Doctors are raising fees for outpatient services because patients tend to be more highly reimbursed for them and are less likely to complain The higher reimbursement was intended to encourage use of outpatient services, which are generally cheaper than hospital care. _ Doctors are requiring more follow-up visits, some of which may not be medically necessary `` The providers of care have gotten wise to some of the tricks and are compensating for it,'' <PERSON> Erb </PERSON> said in an interview. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. Ring, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said in response he did not see any evidence that doctors were reaping big fee increases from the shift to outpatient care. Ring, a family physician in <LOCATION> Mundelein </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, also said he would like to see statistics backing up <PERSON> Erb </PERSON>'s claim that doctors were requiring medically unnecessary follow-up visits. <PERSON> Erb </PERSON> said he did not have such statistics. The 1988 increase was smallest, 15.6 percent, for companies with under 1,000 employees, which usually pay for their plans through insurers. Insurers did not anticipate the big increase in expenses last year and are likely to put through big increases this year to compensate, <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> said. To illustrate the increased availability of high-tech medical care, <PERSON> Erb </PERSON> said there are about 120 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> medical centers that can do heart transplants, up from 30 just two years ago. Also, he said, it has become common for hospitals to give heart-attack patients a dose or even two of TPA, a clot-dissolving drug that costs $ 2,000 a dose. `` ` Miraculous cures' are becoming more common,'' he said in a written statement. `` But miracles cost money.'' The cost of providing benefits for mental health and substance abuse shot up 27 percent in 1988 to an average of $ 207 per employee and now totals 9.6 percent of total medical plan costs, <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> said. At the same time, more employees are screening prospective employees for substance abuse. Twenty-four percent screened at least some prospective employees last year, up from 20 percent in 1987, the survey found. <PERSON> Erb </PERSON> said health plans that require employees to share costs are usually successful in reducing costs to employers. But health maintenance organizations, which were touted as a way to rein in expenses, apparently have not succeeded as planned, he said. According to the <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> survey, 59 percent of employers said premiums paid to health maintenance organizations -LRB- HMOs -RRB- were as high as or higher than premiums under traditional health-care plans.

 <ORGANIZATION> Yugo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the importer of inexpensive Yugoslav-made cars, is trying to throw its financial problems into reverse by filing for protection under federal bankruptcy laws. <ORGANIZATION> Yugo </ORGANIZATION>, its parent company and an affiliated corporation asked a bankruptcy judge Monday for protection from their creditors. Their petition said more than 300 companies and individuals may hold claims against the firms. <ORGANIZATION> Yugo </ORGANIZATION>'s sales slipped to 31,546 cars in 1988, a plunge of 35 percent from its 1987 performance. Former company president <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Prior </PERSON> cited sagging sales and the loss of dealerships when he resigned in November. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Commisa </PERSON> signed an order Monday allowing <ORGANIZATION> Impex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Car </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to provide financing and take management control of the company, said <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON>, a company attorney. Impex is an affilliate of <PERSON> Zavodi </PERSON> <PERSON> Crevna </PERSON> <PERSON> Zastava </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Yugoslavian </LOCATION> manufacturer of the Yugo car. `` The purpose of the financing is to continue the sale of <LOCATION> Yugo </LOCATION> automobiles to dealers and to provide the supply of parts to dealers,'' said <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Yugo </LOCATION> was joined in its filing by its parent <ORGANIZATION> Global </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and affiliate <ORGANIZATION> Proton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Toma </PERSON> <PERSON> Savic </PERSON>, a Yugo sales representative from <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, said Monday after the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> the filing could ease <ORGANIZATION> Yugo </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts to stay in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where it has about 250 dealers Some of those dealers objected to the decision. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Loehr </PERSON>, a dealer in <LOCATION> Kalamazoo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION> who also sells other lines of cars, said Yugo dealers tried to talk company officials out of filing the bankruptcy papers. `` The dealers thought that the investors group -LRB- behind <LOCATION> Yugo </LOCATION> -RRB- was a bottomless pit,'' he said, adding that the dealers had heard rumors about a possible bankruptcy filing for some time. The filing did not shock industry analysts. `` It's really not a surprise at all'' said analyst <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Cedergren </PERSON> of California-based J.D. Power and Associates. `` Global Motors has had some financial difficulties for a while now,'' <PERSON> Cedergren </PERSON> said. `` They put a great deal of money into <ORGANIZATION> Global </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> hoping they would turn it around.'' `` It really did n't help that much,'' he said. Analyst <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Heaney </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said the car's design may have been to blame for the filing ` I just think it was n't attractive and you might as well spend the extra thousand and get something else,'' she said. `` That's what happened.'' <LOCATION> Yugo </LOCATION>, based in <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Saddle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, touted its boxy subcompact cars as the cheapest new auto in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> when they went on sale in August 1985 at $ 3,995. Sales topped 39,100 in the first 10 months of 1987, but dropped to 26,000 in the same period of 1988, according to figures released by the company. Several calls placed Monday to the company were not answered. In its filing, <ORGANIZATION> Yugo </ORGANIZATION> listed $ 30.5 million in assets and the same amount in liability and equity. Global Motors listed $ 27.4 million in each category. <ORGANIZATION> Proton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> listed $ 10,000 in each. <PERSON> Mabon </PERSON> <PERSON> Nugent </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment banking company which invested $ 10.5 million in <ORGANIZATION> Global </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> and owns 33 percent of the company, said the bankruptcy filing was welcome. `` It is appropriate that the <LOCATION> Yugoslavian </LOCATION> manufacturer of the car has come forward with support necessary for the company to proceed. Hopefully, they will be able to complete a plan of reorganization and continue to serve Yugo dealers and customers,'' the banking concern said. Court papers said the filing was authorized by <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Kole </PERSON>, the company's chief financial officer and acting chief executive officer. He said the company is committed to doing business in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In April 1988, <ORGANIZATION> Yugo </ORGANIZATION> had 300 employees and now has 60, <PERSON> Kole </PERSON> said.

The new rules, approved at a Cabinet meeting, will be put into effect April 1, <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials said. `` Amid the ongoing internationalization and popularization of securities transactions, regulations on insider trading are indispensable for a sound development of our country's securities market by increasing the sense of fairness and transparency in the stock market,'' Finance Minister <PERSON> Tatsuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Murayama </PERSON> told a news conference. <PERSON> Murayama </PERSON> said that to protect investors, companies should `` make an effort to positively open up their company information, while establishing a moral climate to prevent insider trading.'' In <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, large-scale insider trading is limited because of the infrequency of corporate takeovers, analysts say. But leaks of information about company developments to a limited number of investors are believed to be frequent, along with stock manipulation by some large brokerages, financial sources say. The <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> has become the world's largest stock market, exceeding <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in terms of market capitalization. But Japanese law previously lacked a clear-cut definition of insider trading. Under the newly revised <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION>, securities subject to insider trading regulations are company bonds, stocks and warrant bonds issued by domestic and foreign companies listed on the stock exchange, the officials said. They said the new rules restrict advance leaks of `` important information'' concerning companies, including decisions made by board meetings on such matters as mergers and aquisitions, introduction of new products, financing and cooperative agreements. `` Any person who leaks, for example, the news of a company's merger will face up to six months imprisonment or a fine of 500,000 yen -LRB- $ 3,900 -RRB-,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity The new rules say important information will be regarded as public 12 hours after it has been released to more than two news organizations. News organizations include general newspapers, news agencies and broadcasting organizations. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s recent major stock scandal involved a different type of practice _ offering selected key politicians and businessmen stock shares not yet listed for public trading. Once public trading did begin in the shares of <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cosmos </ORGANIZATION>, a real estate company, prices rose and early buyers made large profits. The practice was not illegal, but raised questions of ethics and disguised bribery.

 <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanks </PERSON> has about 30 Yugos on the lot of <ORGANIZATION> Sundance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chevrolet </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lansing </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, and he's wondering what's going to happen to them <ORGANIZATION> Yugo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the troubled importer of inexpensive Yugoslavian-made cars, its parent company and an affiliate on Monday filed for protection under federal bankruptcy laws. <LOCATION> Yugo </LOCATION> officials maintain they want to continue doing business in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and that another marketing system would be set up. The company said the supply of cars, which sell for about $ 5,000 apiece, would continue along with warranty work. That was good news for dealers like <PERSON> Hanks </PERSON>, many of whom tried to talk the company out of filing the bankruptcy papers. `` It's a good little car,'' <PERSON> Hanks </PERSON> said, calling the bankruptcy filing a `` shame.'' <PERSON> Hanks </PERSON> said in a telephone interview that his dealership sells about 400 cars a month, 30 of which are Yugos. But he also said it was possible the dealership would get rid of the franchise if <ORGANIZATION> Yugo </ORGANIZATION>'s price rose too much. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, sales manager of <PERSON> Elhart </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodge-Yugo </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, agreed that the boxy, economy car is a good seller. `` The <LOCATION> Yugo </LOCATION> has done a good job for us,'' he said. `` It's filled a good -LRB- car market -RRB- niche.'' He said the <LOCATION> Yugo </LOCATION> has outsold every model Dodge offers except its popular Caravan minivan. Nationwide, Yugo sales dropped 35 percent in 1988 compared with 1987. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Mackie </PERSON>, general manager of Classic Chevrolet in <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rapids </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, said his organization decided two months ago to drop the car. `` We had written a letter to them to resign our franchise,'' he said. `` Basically, we are sitting with 37 of their automobiles that they are to purchase back from us.'' Co-owner <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Shephard </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> O'Donnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gabriel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, also has bailed out of a Yugo franchise. `` We're done with <PERSON> Yugo </PERSON>,'' he said. `` We canceled in August, took a 90-day extension on parts and warranty and delivered our last Yugo earlier this month.'' <PERSON> Shephard </PERSON> said <PERSON> Yugo </PERSON> still owes him about $ 20,000 for unpaid warranty claims and factory incentive costs for which he put up the money. `` We thought pretty much in October that we would not see that,'' he said. <PERSON> Shephard </PERSON> said he did n't think anything was wrong with the car, it just did n't sell. But Yugos began leaving his lot when he slashed the price to $ 2,900, at a loss of about $ 2,500 per car. `` I'm glad to say that we do n't have any more,'' he said.

 Interest rates on short-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> securities rose in the government's latest auction to the highest level in three weeks. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sold $ 7.2 billion in three-month bills at an average discount rate of 8.33 percent on Monday, up from 8.26 percent last week.

 <ORGANIZATION> Shamrock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has filed a lawsuit to block <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 1.1 billion stock buyback plan, which analysts believe was designed to thwart a hostile takeover by the television and radio concern. <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>, the Disney-owned company that has been pursuing <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> since last summer, filed suit Monday in <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The suit asks the court to prohibit both <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s buyback program and its plan to issue $ 300 million in convertible preferred stock, which also were announced on Monday. <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> said it indicated it had invited two members of the investor group, <ORGANIZATION> Corporate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> L.P. </ORGANIZATION>, to join its board of directors. In its suit, <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> alleges <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s directors `` breached their fiduciary duties by issuing additional, dilutive voting securities to persons friendly to management in the face of <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>'s announced intention to wage a proxy contest at <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s upcoming annual meeting. Since July, the instant photography pioneer has been fighting a hostile buyout offer from Shamrock, which is offering $ 45 a share in a tender offer that values <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> at about $ 3.2 billion. <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>, a television and radio concern owned by the <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Disney </PERSON> family, also has indicated it will wage a proxy fight for control of <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s board at the company's annual meeting in May, and if successful would force the sale of <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> either under its offer or a higher third-party bid. <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> president and chief executive officer <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> called <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s actions irresponsible and a sign of entrenched management. `` The placement of preferred stock, together with the proposed stock buy-back program, is clearly a defensive action designed to park even more <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> shares in ` friendly hands' at the expense of <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s public shareholders,'' <PERSON> Gold </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> stock closed Monday at $ 40.62 -LCB-, up 62 -LCB- cents in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite trading. Polaroid spokesman <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Yanes </PERSON> denied the planned stock issue was a defensive move designed to discourage Burbank-based Shamrock's advances `` It's designed simply to deliver a portion of the company's current value while enhancing the growth prospects for its values,'' <PERSON> Yanes </PERSON> said Companies frequently buy their own stock to reduce the number of shares outstanding and to raise the stock price. Such practices have become common among companies seeking to discourage takeovers. Some analysts said <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s stock buyback was unlikely to attract shareholders unless the market price of <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> stock tops <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>'s $ 45-a-share offer. `` There's no incentive for people to sell the <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> stock,'' said <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> said stockholders would do better to tender their stock to <LOCATION> Shamrock </LOCATION> and wait for the market price to rise. If the stock appreciates, he said, stockholders could withdraw the tendered shares and sell them on the open market. `` The catalyst to all this restructuring is <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>, whether -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> officials -RRB- admit it or not,'' he said. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Enderlin </PERSON>, an analyst with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, predicted <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s stock price would rise due to the repurchase plan. He said the company was prepared to pay more than the $ 45 offered by <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>. `` Unless Shamrock comes back with another increase I think definitely the pendulum has swung to <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> protecting their own company,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION>. The preferred stock to be issued to <ORGANIZATION> Corporate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, a firm managed by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investors <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Wambold </PERSON>, is convertible to common stock at a price of $ 50 a share. The group also received warrants to purchase 635,000 shares of <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> common stock at $ 50 a share. <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> has 71.6 million common shares outstanding. <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors last week rejected as inadequate <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>'s sweetened $ 45 offer, which includes 9.7 million shares issued under <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s employee stock ownership plan. <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> is appealing a <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> court ruling that upheld the <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> employee stock ownership plan. Polaroid is incorporated in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> contends the employee stock was issued specifically to block a takeover. If the plan is invalidated, <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> says, it will raise its offer to $ 3.36 billion, or $ 47 per share.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> voted today to recommend that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirm President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s nomination of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oilman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> as commerce secretary.

But Common Cause said Monday the committee's vote should be postponed until more complete information is obtained on corporate donors to the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The group says it wants to ensure against a conflict-of-interest between those corporate contributors and <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>'s work as commerce secretary. Common Cause says the <ORGANIZATION> RNC </ORGANIZATION> has yet to release a full and accurate list of the people and corporations that gave at least $ 100,000 each to the `` Team 100'' fund-raising drive led by <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>, who was <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief fund-raiser. The Republicans released a list of people who had made contributions, but said much of the money was given on behalf of corporations that were not identified. Common Cause President <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Wertheimer </PERSON> said the information on corporate donors was needed `` to allow the public to be able to identify any possible connections that might arise between the soft-money contributions and any direct interest the contributors may end up having in issues before the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> under Mr. <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>'s leadership.'' <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, responded that he would not delay the vote because it would be wrong to `` raise sand'' over conduct that was allowed under federal election law. <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> did say that he would introduce legislation to limit spending in federal elections. `` The fault here lies with the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and not with Mr. <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>,'' he said.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings expanded nearly five-fold in the final three months of 1988, in part because of improved earnings from refining and marketing operations and a $ 98 million after-tax gain on the sale of the company's downtown headquarters, the company reported. The company said Monday other factors contributing to the rise included increased gains from asset sales and improved chemicals earnings. For the fourth quarter, after-tax profit totaled $ 141 million, or $ 1.21 a share, on revenue of $ 2.6 billion. That compared with earnings of $ 29 million, or 26 cents a share, on revenue of $ 2.3 billion in the same period in 1987. Profits for all of 1988 rose 165 percent to $ 480 million, or $ 4.12 a share, from $ 181 million, or $ 1.56 a share in 1987. <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION> President and Chief Executive Officer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stegemeier </PERSON> said the stronger earnings were the result of higher demand for refined products and improved product margins, although there was some margin slippage at the end of the year. The 1988 results also include a $ 33 million after-tax refund for overpayment of windfall profit tax and a $ 13 million gain from the settlement of certain pension obligations, <PERSON> Stegemeier </PERSON> said. He said the company's refining, marketing and transportation segment recorded earnings of $ 182 million in 1988, up from $ 42 million in 1987. For the fourth quarter, earnings were $ 58 million, up from $ 14 million the previous year.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday its net income for the fourth quarter rose 22 percent as the soft drink company benefited from increased international sales and a drop in costs. Annual earnings for the Atlanta-based company were up 14 percent, going over the billion-dollar mark for the first time in the company's 103-year-history. The previous record was $ 934 million in 1986 before the company spun off its bottling and movie subsidiaries. For the quarter ended Dec. 31, <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 235.5 million compared with $ 193 million a year earlier. After a $ 5.2 million deduction for preferred stock dividends, the earnings were 65 cents per share, compared to 52 cents in the 1987 quarter, when there was no preferred stock deduction. Fourth-quarter revenue edged up 1.8 percent to $ 2.03 billion from $ 1.99 billion a year earlier. The cost of goods sold fell 8.1 percent for the quarter to $ 912.8 million from $ 993.4 million. For the year, net income was $ 1.04 billion from $ 916.14 million in 1987. After a $ 6.43 million preferred stock dividend, earnings per share were $ 2.85, compared with $ 2.43 in 1987 when there was no preferred stock dividend. The company said foreign soft drink shipments grew 7 percent last year, led by combined volume and operating income increases of 26 percent in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and 12 percent in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. Domestically, soft drink concentrate and syrup shipments rose 6 percent and operating income was up 9 percent. Retail case sales advanced an estimated 5 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION>, which includes Hi-C and Minute Maid brands, had a 15 percent increase in volume for its boxed fruit juices. However, volume for frozen orange juice was down 22 percent and chilled orange juice volume fell 6 percent. The company reported a 34 percent increase in operating income growth for the division, however, because of a restructuring in 1987. <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> reported a 57 percent decline in equity income because of lower earnings at <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> resulting from the one-time writedowns associated with restructuring. In December 1987, <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary was combined with <ORGANIZATION> Tri-Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> to form <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which is now a free-standing company in which <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> owns 49 percent of the stock. <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> also owns 49 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the largest bottler of <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> products. Those two companies contributed $ 29.5 million in income for the quarter and $ 48.3 million for the year. During 1988, the company said it repurchased 18.9 million shares of common stock, decreasing outstanding shares by 3.4 percent. In all, the company has bought back 25.5 million of the announced repurchase of 40 million shares.

 The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to extend its deadline and continue negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, averting a walkout by 1,700 miners scheduled for midnight tonight. Union President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> told a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> news conference the union would accept a request by the governors of <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> to call off the strike deadline in favor of continued negotiations. Govs. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gaston </PERSON> <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> made the request last week, asking the union to agree to a 30-to-60-day cooling-off period. <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> promised to comply with that request. At the same time, however, <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> announced the latest development in the union's `` corporate campaign'' of trying to put pressure on <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> through protests and other actions against the company and its business partners. Today's target was <ORGANIZATION> Crestar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, one of five banks that in December 1987 extended to <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> a $ 100 million line of credit. That was one month before the expiration of the miners' contract They have been working wothout a contract since. <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Crestar </ORGANIZATION> boycott began today with the withdrawal of $ 29.7 million from the bank _ $ 23 million by the Bakery and <ORGANIZATION> Confectionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> and $ 6.7 million by the UMW. `` I anticipate that millions more will be withdrawn from <ORGANIZATION> Crestar </ORGANIZATION> to protest its financial support of <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> said. In a letter to the three governors announcing the extension of the strike deadline, <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> thanked them for their support and said the union for the most part has `` walked the road alone'' in its search for a fair settlement to the contract squabble with <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>. And he again called on <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> chief executive officer <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> to meet face-to-face with him to discuss the negotiations. The <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, is the corporate parent of the coal group, based in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. Miners have been on the job with no contract at <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> since last Feb. 1 After <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> refused to sign a wage agreement the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> reached at other major eastern producers. The sides met again Monday, but dd not resolve their differences. Over the past week, the company has been considering a union contract offer made last Tuesday in response to an offer <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> made on Nov. 9. During the year of negotiations, each side had accused the other of hindering progress by refusing to bargain in good faith. <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> had said repeatedly it planned to operate through a strike, perhaps by hiring permanent replacement miners. The union responded with a `` corporate strategy'' in which it tried to pressure <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> through demonstrations and other actions against its business partners.

 Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, flanked by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, today announced formation of special task forces to target `` crime in the suites,'' primarily securities and commodities fraud. The Securities and Commodities Fraud Task Forces, including 15 additional assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys, will be located in six cities: <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> already have undertaken substantial investigations of the markets in those two cities. `` We are undertaking to bring this additional firepower to bear on behalf of investors who might otherwise run the risk of being defrauded or lose confidence in the market,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. He said the task forces were being formed to `` combat what can aptly be called crime in the suites.'' Fraud is being committed `` under the guise of respectability in the financial and securities markets,'' he said. In addition, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> loses more than $ 90 billion a year as a result of tax fraud, and white-collar crime has been a factor in many recent business failures, including many of the bank and savings and loan closings. There was no immediate word on how much the new effort will cost. Those involved in the task forces will be senior, experienced prosecutors who will be replaced in their current jobs by new attorneys, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> S.G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, assistant attorney general in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s criminal division, said at a news conference. The task forces will concentrate on the most complex and difficult frauds, including stock loan frauds, precious metals fraud, `` parking'' of securities with buyers concealing how much of a stake they have in a company's stock, and major bank and brokerage frauds, plus tax evasion, obstruction of justice and perjury, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. `` These investigations are difficult and require the sophisticated efforts of experienced prosecutors,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. `` They are not made by breaking down the door and seizing the evidence.'' Agents from the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> also will be involved in the probes. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, who is leaving his post today after five years, made a name for himself in part by attacking insider trading on Wall Street and has long called for additional money to uncover fraud in the securities markets. <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> supervised a two-year undercover investigation of the nation's largest commodity markets, resulting in allegations that as many as 100 brokers and traders systematically cheated customers and profited themselves in illegal trades. Under the new task forces, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> will get six additional assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys, while the offices in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> will get three each, and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> will get one apiece. An unspecified number of investigators, paralegal workers and other support personnel will be added to those offices as well. In addition to <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> was joined at the news conference by <PERSON> Benito </PERSON> <PERSON> Romano </PERSON>, who becomes interim <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney for <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> on Wednesday after <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> steps down, and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ulrich </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and chairman of the attorney general's <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Varity Makes New Offer for Fruehauf</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Varity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has made a new offer for <ORGANIZATION> Fruehauf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> that would be more favorable for <ORGANIZATION> Fruehauf </ORGANIZATION> stockholders than <PERSON> Fruehauf </PERSON>'s own recapitalization plan, <ORGANIZATION> Varity </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. The total amount of the offer was undisclosed. <ORGANIZATION> Varity </ORGANIZATION> and Fruehauf officials did not immediately return phone calls seeking details. <ORGANIZATION> Varity </ORGANIZATION> called off earlier negotiations on acquisition of Fruehauf in October, citing only its review of Fruehauf's records and assets. <ORGANIZATION> Varity </ORGANIZATION>, formerly <ORGANIZATION> Massey-Ferguson </ORGANIZATION>, is a Toronto-based farm and industrial machinery maker. Fruehauf makes truck trailers and automotive and maritime products, and its <PERSON> Kelsey </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> subsidiary is a leading supplier of antilock braking systems. Fruehauf has struggled with debt since a 1986 leveraged buyout and reported a net loss of $ 41.5 million for 1987. After <ORGANIZATION> Varity </ORGANIZATION>'s earlier offer was called off, <ORGANIZATION> Fruehauf </ORGANIZATION> said in December it would propose recapitalization, deferring some debt and increasing cash available for operations. It also said it would explore other alternatives presented to the company. The new <ORGANIZATION> Varity </ORGANIZATION> offer came in a letter dated Monday from <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Varity </ORGANIZATION>, to <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Combs </PERSON>, vice chairman and chief executive officer of Fruehauf <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> proposed that <ORGANIZATION> Varity </ORGANIZATION> acquire <PERSON> Fruehauf </PERSON> in an exchange of <ORGANIZATION> Varity </ORGANIZATION> shares for <ORGANIZATION> Fruehauf </ORGANIZATION> stock. Holders of Fruehauf notes and debentures would receive a combination of <ORGANIZATION> Varity </ORGANIZATION> shares and new <ORGANIZATION> Fruehauf </ORGANIZATION> debt guaranteed by <ORGANIZATION> Varity </ORGANIZATION>. The offer would be more favorable for stockholders than <PERSON> Fruehauf </PERSON>'s proposed recapitalization, he said. `` They would not be dependent for the value of their securities on the future operations of Fruehauf alone.'' <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> said the offer would remain open until 5 p.m. Feb. 17.

<HEAD>Facsimile Machines Transform Life But Can Create Headaches _ and
Lawsuits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN SCHWARTZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Facsimile machines, the latest office rage, have made it easier and possibly more fun for workers to work, stay in touch, and even order lunch, but they also have fallen prey to human goofs and greed. A presidential candidate used a fax machine to enter the race at the last minute. A <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> radio station accepts contest entries by fax _ and notifies winners the same way. But a leading retailer recently lost a $ 73 million lawsuit in federal court here partly because a confidential document was faxed to the wrong place, and irritation is growing as `` junk fax'' increases. Still, `` Once you have one you ca n't live without it, and you use it more and more,'' said <PERSON> Elliot </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, co-author of `` The Book of Fax: An Impartial Guide to Buying & amp; Using Fascimile Machines.'' The machines convert a page of information into an electronic format, then transmit it via telephone line to another machine on the other end, where it is decoded and printed. The average office fax costs $ 1,000 to $ 4,000. More than 4 million fax machines will be purchased by 1991, and sales are expected to grow at 30 percent a year well into the 1990s, according to King's book. `` To a lot of people the fax machine has become a fact of life in the office,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Crouse </PERSON>, advertising and promotion director for <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s WROR-FM. The radio station has been using the fax to entice office workers to listen. It has been running a contest asking workers to fax in the funniest thing found lying around the office. The chuckle of the day wins, with the victor receiving notification from the station via fax. `` They not only have to send us the fax, but they have to watch their fax machines to see if they've won,'' said <PERSON> Crouse </PERSON>. Office workers can also use the machines to place lunch orders at `` fax food'' restaurants. `` We do a lot of delivery and takeout and for them to just fax over their order, it goes through less hands and it keeps the order more correct,'' said <PERSON> Evie </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, manager of <PERSON> Maxine </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Seafood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cafe </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` It saves us in tying up phone lines.'' She said the restaurant, which got its fax machine in October, gets about half its takeout requests via fax, roughly 15 to 20 orders per day. The portable fax opens up a whole new world to faxaholics. `` I had a guy come in here once who wanted a portable one so he could take it golfing,'' said <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Villaloando </PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Citifax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Northbrook </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. Portable fax machines were used constantly during the presidential election, said <PERSON> Tad </PERSON> <PERSON> Devine </PERSON>, director of delegate selection for <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' Democratic primary campaign and campaign coordinator for vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> Both candidates traveled in planes equipped with fax machines. They also had portable fax for use in their hotel rooms, he said. Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> almost missed his chance to run for the Democratic presidential nomination when his filing papers failed to show up for the primary deadline. `` When it was not there late that afternoon, his campaign was contacted by the secretary of state in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s campaign sent in a fax,'' said <PERSON> Devine </PERSON> But fax fiascos can be expensive. A federal lawsuit that ended in a $ 73 million judgment against <ORGANIZATION> K </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> earlier this month was initiated when a clerk mistakenly faxed a confidential document to <ORGANIZATION> Fashion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, a Pawtucket-based merchandise wholesaler. The document, an estimate of the commissions owed, was intended for K mart headquarters in <LOCATION> Troy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>. K mart is appealing the judgment `` It is a danger,'' agrees King. `` It's like mail without an envelope and you can make a lot of mistakes.'' Just like the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, junk mail is a problem. A <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> legislator recently proposed legislation that would ban the unsolicited use of fax machines to send advertising messages. `` It's a really effective way for people to direct sales and services,'' <PERSON> King </PERSON> said, explaining the 10 percent return on mass faxings is more than double that of bulk mailings. In addition, the `` fax attacks'' cost the solicitor less money than mailings because there are no printing, envelope stuffing or postage fees. The owners of the targeted telecopier, however, gets stung $ 3 to $ 4 for the price of paper, printing and manpower, said King. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Fishman </PERSON>, <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s co-author, envisons another problem _ fax-a-porn. `` Some enterprising young person sometime will enter the business of pornography,'' he said. `` Call up and get a pornographic photograph'' faxed to you.

<HEAD>Cut The Capital Gains Tax?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It appears that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wo n't give up on his idea of cutting the capital gains tax, which pretty much guarantees an explosive battle in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. That battle will erupt because capital gains are seen as something that involve the rich. But either that notion is false or millions of Americans now qualify as rich, and the list grows larger with every year. In truth, capital gains concern anyone who inherited or purchased a few shares of stock or a house or who in almost any other way built a financial estate through ingenuity, hard work or just luck. Under the 1986 tax act, the capital gains tax was raised from a maximum of 20 percent to 28 percent for all earners of capital gains. The increase was 40 percent for wealthy taxpayers, but 100 percent for many poorer taxpayers, who real capital gains rate was only 14 percent or 15 percent. It brought capital gains taxes in line with taxes on ordinary income. That was bad enough, said critics, who also observed other quirks in the situation _ that such taxes can be applied to income never made, to buying power that never existed, and to funds a taxpayer never got a chance to use. Definition: Capital gains are profits realized from the sale of capital assets such as securities or real estate. Often they involve risk, and usually they are the results of long-term investments. For this and other reasons, including the nation's need for such capital investments, gains generally were taxed at less than ordinary income. Consider the consequences now of taxing such long-term gains at the same rate as ordinary income _ income that is taxed during the same year in which it is earned. Assume an investment of $ 5,000 in stock held for seven years. If the appreciation averages 10 percent over that time the investor will have about doubled his money. The capital gains would be $ 5,000; the tax about $ 1,400. While it appears the invester earned 10 percent, he really earned only 6 percent because the value of the dollar changed in that time. Inflation eroded it at a rate of 4 percent a year, an assumption but a very safe one. At 6 percent a year money will not double in seven years. The $ 5,000 sum will grow to about $ 7,100 in buying power. But the investor will pay capital gains taxes as if it had grown to $ 10,000. He will pay $ 1,400 in taxes. Deducting the taxes from the inflation-adjusted total earned leaves him with just $ 5,600 or $ 5,700 _ an average annual gain of $ 100 or less for having risked his money and invested his savings in the American economy. The example is a modest one. Consider, for example, a person who put some money away back in 1970 with the idea of using it for retirement. The investment has since tripled in value to a very tidy sum. Or has it? Consumer price inflation in 1970 was 5.9 percent, followed by 4.3 percent in 1971, 3.3 percent in 1972. Not too bad, but then it hit 6.2 percent in 1973 and 11 percent in 1974. It never fell below 5.8 percent through 1978. Thereafter, the tale becomes grim. Three successive years of double-digit inflation hit, the worst of these years being 1980, when official consumer price inflation measured year to year struck 13.5 percent. By the year 1983, the value of the 1970 dollar had been cut in half and, of course, it has been cut additionally since then, even though inflation has been restrained to an `` acceptable'' 3 - to 5 percent a year The 1970 investor has allegedly tripled his money. Assuming an investment of $ 5,000, he now has more than $ 15,000, although sensible people know that in 1970 dollars it is worth less than half that, or about $ 7,000. Nevertheless, should that investor sell, he has a $ 10,000 capital gain on which taxes must be paid. And that tax will levied at the same rate at which money currently earned is taxed. that is, as if it had current buying power. In short, the investor will be liable for $ 2,800 tax on what in effect is $ 7,000 in terms of the 1970 dollar. He ends up with a net loss.

<HEAD>Control Data Posts $12.8 Million Loss In Fourth Quarter</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday reported a fourth-quarter loss of $ 12.8 million and annual profits of only $ 1.7 million, while its chairman forecast another disappointing year for 1989. The fourth-quarter results of the <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION>, Minn.-based computer maker compared to net earnings in the same period a year ago of $ 10.8 million, or 26 cents a share. Sales for the quarter of $ 933 million were slightly ahead of last year's $ 927 million. It was the second consecutive quarter of losses after four profitable quarters. For the year, <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION>'s net income dropped to 3 cents a share on sales of $ 3.6 billion from the 1987 level of $ 19.3 million, or 45 cents a share, on sales of $ 3.4 billion. The computer maker suffered from poor results in its mainframe, supercomputer and semiconductor businesses, Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON> said. `` Although we anticipate the majority of <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> businesses to be profitable in 1989, the company's overall operating performance will continue to be disappointing until we fix the problems that undermined 1988 results,'' Price said. `` The goal for the coming year is to resolve those problems and lay a foundation that is the basis of strong performance in subsequent years.'' Mainframe computer shipments in 1988 were hurt by delays in getting critical logic ships from a supplier and by soft demand, especially in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, Price said. In July the company temporarily shut down several of its mainframe plants and temporarily idled 7 percent of its work force in response to the trouble. The company's new <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> supercomputer subsidiary had poor 1988 results, and semiconductor revenues were off partly because the data storage market continues to be weak, he said. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Foltz </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the company, said layoffs, attrition and the sale of some businesses in 1988 resulted in a 2.3 percent decrease in <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION>'s work force from 34,500 employees at the end of 1987 to 33,700 at the end of 1988. In addition, the company has told its 27,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> employees that they must take five days off without pay in the first quarter of this year. Other changes at <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> included changes in top management in December, including the appointment of <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Perlman </PERSON> as president.

<HEAD>GATT Panel Backs EEC In Dispute Over U.S. Trade Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An international trade panel has recommended the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> amend its Tariff Act of 1930 to make it comply with international trade rules, the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. It said a disputes panel of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the world trade body, found Section 337 of the act violates international trade rules. The section deals with the right of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to rule on patent violations by importers. The disputes panel said by comparison patent violations of U.S.-produced goods go to federal court where accused parties have a better chance to defend themselves than those before the <ORGANIZATION> ITC </ORGANIZATION>. The panels' finding will be discussed by the full <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Feb. 8, <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Nico </PERSON> <PERSON> Wegter </PERSON> said. `` The commission is, of course, pleased with the fact that the panel shares the view of the commission'' that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> violates international trade rules. Officials at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mission to the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> declined to comment on the ruling that was issued in December but was not made public unitil Tuesday. The panel's ruling stems from a 10-year-old dispute between <ORGANIZATION> Akzo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NV </ORGANIZATION>, the Dutch chemicals group, and <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> over patent rights for aramid fibers. These synthetic fibers are used in the automotive, aerospace, defense and construction industries. In November 1985, the <ORGANIZATION> ITC </ORGANIZATION> blocked imports into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of <ORGANIZATION> AKZO </ORGANIZATION>'s aramid fibers saying the company had violated <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION>'s patent rights <ORGANIZATION> Akzo </ORGANIZATION> complained to the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> commission about the procedure used by <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> to seek protection from foreign competitors under section 337 of the Tariffs Act. In 1987, the commission found the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law to amount to an unfair trade practice. It took the issue to <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> where a special disputes panel was formed later that year. The commission said Tuesday if the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which is made up of officials of the 100 or so <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> member states, adopts the panel's report, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must take the `` necessary measures to rectify as quickly as possible the present situation. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> chemical federation, <ORGANIZATION> Cefic </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> AKZO </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> had settled their dispute while the investigation was continuing. He welcomed the ruling on Section 337 saying it represented was `` increasingly burdensome'' for <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> businesses and said the panel's ruling was `` a victory'' for the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>

<HEAD>French Commission Urges Criminal Probe Of Suspicious Stock Buys</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s stock market watchdog agency on Tuesday recommended a criminal investigation of the insider trading scandal that has embarrassed the Socialist government, but said it could not identify individuals guilty of leaking information that led to suspicious stock purchases. The <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> des </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bourse </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Theret </PERSON>, a businessman with close ties to the governing <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, made `` eminently suspicious'' purchases of stock in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company <ORGANIZATION> Triangle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> just before it was acquired by the French state-owned firm <ORGANIZATION> Pechiney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION>. The COB, in an unusual public report, said explanations by <PERSON> Theret </PERSON> and his associates were contradictory and apparently were made up after the fact, and it appeared that <PERSON> Theret </PERSON> or another official of his investment firm, the <ORGANIZATION> Compagnie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parisienne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Placements </ORGANIZATION>, received an inside tip of the imminent takeover. The agency recommended a criminal investigation, but said it was not able to identify who, in or out of the government, might have provided the information for inside trading by Theret or others. The COB has no enforcement or punishment power, and has no power to investigate outside of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. The agency can, however, investigate locally and recommend prosecution to the state prosecutor's office. Theret's investment firm bought 32,300 shares of <ORGANIZATION> Triangle </ORGANIZATION> stock just before the sale to <ORGANIZATION> Pechiney </ORGANIZATION> and made a profit of $ 1.4 million. Theret has said he decided to buy Triangle stock based on his research into the packaging industry and has denied getting inside tips. The commission also said a close friend of President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, <PERSON> Roger-Patrice </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelat </PERSON>, was among the investors who profited by purchasing Triangle stock at about $ 10 a share in the days just before <ORGANIZATION> Pechiney </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 56 a share buyout offer on Nov. 21. <PERSON> Pelat </PERSON>, his wife and sons made more than $ 350,000 in the deal, the commission said, but it did not accuse <PERSON> Pelat </PERSON> of insider trading or any other wrongdoing. The <ORGANIZATION> COB </ORGANIZATION> said it found `` serious, precise and concordant'' indications of illegal activity, but said it could not identify anyone guilty of leaking word of the deal. Commission chairman <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Farge </PERSON> acknowledged his investigators had been unable to track all the suspicious trading, some of which was conducted by corporations based in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. Because <ORGANIZATION> Pechiney </ORGANIZATION> is state-owned, several high government officials were kept informed of the negotiations with Triangle and government approval was required. Premier <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> and other Socialist leaders have responded to the burgeoning scandal in recent weeks by saying previous conservative governments were involved in more serious scandals than this one, while promising to bring out the truth and punish any wrongdoing. The affair led earlier this month to the resignation of <PERSON> Alain </PERSON> <PERSON> Boublil </PERSON>, Finance Minister <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Beregovoy </PERSON>'s top aide, the government official most closely involved with the takeover. <PERSON> Boublil </PERSON> said he wanted to be free to defend himself more vigorously. A series of newspaper and magazine articles strongly have hinted that <PERSON> Boublil </PERSON> leaked the information. <PERSON> Pelat </PERSON>, who has known <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> since their days together in a German prisoner-of-war camp and in the French Resistance, is one of six people identified in the report as having bought shares during the few days after the Pechiney-Triangle deal was reached and reported to the French government, but before it was made public. <PERSON> Pelat </PERSON>'s stock moves, and nearly all other elements of the commission's report, had been widely reported in French news accounts of the scandal, which has dominated the political scene for weeks. But the commission report, with its extensive examination of Theret's explanation for his purchases, was seen as likely to give new political impetus to the scandal.

<HEAD>Boom Appears Headed for Bust: U.S. Population Growth Likely to Peak
in 2038</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The population boom appears headed for a bust in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, with <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> experts projecting Tuesday that the number of Americans will stop growing in 50 years and then begin to shrink. The prime reason: A decline in births as the post-World War II Baby Boom matures. The aging of that giant generation means that never again will <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> have as many women in the prime childbearing ages of 18 to 34 as it now does, census demographer <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> said. `` After 1995 the population may grow more slowly than ever before _ more slowly than even during the Great Depression of the 1930s,'' <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> said. His study estimated that the nation's population could rise gradually from the current 247 million to a peak of nearly 302 million by the year 2038 and then begin to decline. That is the middle projection of a series of some 30 different possibilities included in the study. The lowest growth estimate would have the population peak at 264.5 million in the year 2020 before starting to decline, while the high-growth scenario would have the nation at 501 million and still growing in 2080. While wary of calling one series `` most likely,'' <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> said that in general, when people ask what the population will be like in the future, he gives them the middle series of projections. The bureau compiles 30 sets of estimates, however, in an attempt to account for varying possibilities in birth rates, death rates, differences between races and ethnic groups, immigration and so forth. According to the middle series, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population will climb for 50 years, peaking in 2038, and then begin a modest decline. During that coming half-century the overall increase is expected to total about 56 million, nearly the same amount the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grew during the last 25 years. After that peak, shrinkage should occur, although it will be `` really quite modest,'' <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> said, with the population falling by only about 10 million over the subsequent 42 years. `` So, obviously, it would n't take very much to make this not happen,'' he added. The projection for slower growth, followed by decline, stems from the fact that `` we have had fertility in this country below replacement level since the mid-1970s,'' <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> said. Currently each women has a lifetime average of about 1.8 births, while it takes 2.1 to keep population stable. `` The main thing keeping the number of births up is the sheer enormous number of women of childbearing age,'' <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> said. But those Baby Boomers are now heading into older age groups that tend to have fewer children, while a much smaller group of young women is coming along into the childbearing ages. Already the number of women aged 18 to 34 has begun to decline, the study said. Peaking at 35.3 million in 1985 it slipped to 35.2 million by 1987 and is expected to drop to 34.7 million by 1990 and by 2080 to be below 30 million. <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> noted that the population projections assume that fertility will become slightly higher in the next few years. This is based on the expectation that many women who have postponed families while attending school and launching careers will decide to have children before they become too old to reproduce. The report also says the nation's elderly population, which has attracted so much attention in recent years, is expected to grow more slowly after the mid-1990s, and then accelerate again after 2010. That slowing is expected because the small generation born in the Depression and war years of the 1930s and 1940s will be moving into this age group. But once the postwar Baby Boom reaches that plateau, the elderly segment will resume the rapid growth it has seen in recent years. Other findings of the new report include: _ The share of the population under age 35 may never again be as large as it is now _ 55 percent That percentage is expected to drop to 48 percent in 2000, 46 percent in 2010 and 41 percent in 2030. _ The white population may begin to decline in 40 years while the black and other races population is expected to continue increasing _ By the year 2030, the population could include as many as 32 million immigrants who entered the country after 1986, and their descendants _ 12 percent of the population Here is a rundown of the projected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population in coming years, based on the middle set of estimates. The <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> estimated the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population at 246,879,546 as of Jan. 1 of this year.

<HEAD>BP Shareholders Approve Buyback of Kuwait Shares</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 British <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> shareholders on Tuesday approved a $ 4.2 billion buyback of more than half the 1.32 billion <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION> shares owned by the government of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. Approval of the repurchase followed a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> government order earlier this month that the <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the London-based investment arm of the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> government, reduce its 21.68 percent ownership in the petroleum company to 9.9 percent. An unexpectedly large turnout at the special meeting and the number of proxy votes cast `` show small shareholders have had an interest in what we've been doing and approve,'' <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> said after the vote. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> had been ordered by the British government to dispose of its BP interest above 9.9 percent within three years, but <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION> said the buyback would remove the element of uncertainty over the pending disposal and ultimately aid the performance of the company's shares. The British government's order to the Kuwaitis came after a ruling in October by the <ORGANIZATION> Monopolies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mergers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> that the big Kuwaiti holding could `` operate against the public interest'' because of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s membership in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> built up its holding by buying partly paid <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION> stock in the months following the government's 7.2 billion pound, or $ 13.2 billion, public offering of <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION> shares in October 1987. The sale by the Conservative government under its policy of privatization coincided with the stock market crash. The offering, which included the government's remaining 31.5 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION>, was seriously undersubscribed. Although the price <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION> will pay the Kuwaitis amounts to 305 pence for each of the 790 million shares owned by <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION> will effectively pay 247 pence a share because of tax credits. <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> said the repurchase would be completed by mid-March.

<HEAD>Norway's Unemployment Nearly Doubles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The number of unemployed Norwegians nearly doubled in one year to a postwar record with 4 percent out of work, the government announced Tuesday. `` The registered unemployment rate increased to an extraordinary level -LRB- in January -RRB-, and the figures are the highest that have been registered in postwar time,'' the government labor agency said. Officials at <ORGANIZATION> Norges </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, the central bank, had predicted the increase, calling it a `` necessary evil'' in an austerity program aimed at reducing inflation and other economic problems. The official January figures of 86,600 jobless did not include 36,700 people involved in government-funded work programs. <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> went into a sharp economic decline in the mid-1980s with the drop in prices of oil, a major export. The last unemployment record was in January 1985, when 79,700 people were officially listed as jobless. The labor agency said the January figure was up 16,900 from last month and up 44,000 from a year earlier.

<HEAD>Borden Posts 15.4 Percent Gain In Fourth-Quarter Profit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Borden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday its fourth-quarter profit rose 15.4 percent despite drought-related costs that severely affected the company's dairy products earnings. For the three-month period ended Dec. 31, <ORGANIZATION> Borden </ORGANIZATION>'s net income totaled $ 93.9 million, or $ 1.27 a share, up from $ 81.3 million, or $ 1.10 a share in the year-earlier period. Revenue rose 9.9 percent to $ 1.98 billion from $ 1.8 billion in the 1987 quarter. For all of 1988, the giant food producer posted a 16.8 percent increase in after-tax profit to $ 311.9 million, or $ 4.22 a share, from $ 267.1 million, or $ 3.62 a share in the previous year. The company's revenue for the year totaled $ 7.2 billion, up 11 percent from $ 6.5 billion in 1987. <ORGANIZATION> Borden </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> R.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ventres </PERSON> attributed the latest gains to `` internal business growth spurred by the benefits of acquisitions,'' including the purchase a year ago of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prince </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which makes pasta products. Strong performances by the company's <ORGANIZATION> Snacks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> and the Grocery and Specialty Products Division, including Eagle Brand products, were largely responsible for <PERSON> Borden </PERSON>'s yearlong gains, the company said. But drought-related costs resulted in a 12 percent slump in operating income for the company's dairy sector, to $ 102.3 million in 1988 from $ 116.3 million in 1987. <PERSON> Borden </PERSON> said profit margins were squeezed, especially in the second half, by unprecedented cost jumps for raw milk. `` Fierce competition at the retail level delayed cost recovery in product pricing,'' <PERSON> Borden </PERSON> said.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The volume of help-wanted advertisements in major newspapers rose slightly in December, indicating little change in employers' hiring plans, a business research group said Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said its Help Wanted Advertising Index rose to 161 last month from 157 in November and 156 in the year-ago month. The board said the index fluctuated in a narrow range throughout the year. The seasonally adjusted index equaled 100 in 1967. The index measures volume of classified ads in 51 major newspapers nationwide and is sensitive to changes in the demand for labor and general business conditions. Conference Board Economist <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON> said, `` The monthly survey data show no change in the labor market conditions that have prevailed for the last year or so. But a change may not be that far off.'' <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON> predicted there may be a slowing in the job market in 1988 following a year in which unemployment hit a 14-year low.

 Church, labor and business organizations opened a campaign Tuesday to inform millions of low-income working families that government checks of up to $ 874 a year may be theirs for the asking. `` Money? For me? From the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>? You're kidding!!!'' read posters and ads aimed at spreading the word about the earned-income tax credit. `` If you're thinking about not filing a federal income tax return because you do n't owe any income tax ... think again! They may owe you.'' `` We are concerned that millions of low-income working families with children may miss out on a valuable benefit they have earned,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenstein </PERSON> told a news conference in announcing the drive. <PERSON> Greenstein </PERSON> is director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a non-profit <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> organization that tracks government actions affecting low - and middle-income Americans The center is coordinating the campaign to make sure that all the 11 million families eligible for the tax credit get it. Dozens of organizations are participating in the campaign, ranging from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Veterans </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, to the <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, to the Children's Defense Fund. About 6.3 million families claimed the credit on returns filed in 1987. If all those eligible claimed it this year, it would cost the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> about $ 6 billion. <PERSON> Greenstein </PERSON> said the special effort to educate poorer families is necessary because many are simply unaware the tax credit exists. Although the 1986 tax overhaul expanded the credit and made it available to more families, the new law also removed up to 6 million poor people from the tax rolls and exempted most of them from withholding and from even having to file a tax return. <PERSON> Greenstein </PERSON> fears _ and the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> supports his conclusion _ that because they had no tax withheld, millions of lower-income families will not file a return. They, thus, would miss the credit. The tax-rate reductions in the 1986 law became fully effective for the first time in 1988, and many low-income workers are receiving for the first time a W-2 form indicating they had no tax withheld. The credit is available to working families who have at least one child living at home and had 1988 income of less than $ 18,576. The credit is for 14 percent of the first $ 6,240 of earnings _ chiefly wages and tips. The maximum credit of $ 874 is allowed until income exceeds $ 9,840; the credit then decreases until income reaches $ 18,576, when it disappears. The benefit is unique because it can exceed a family's total income-tax liability, even if the liability is zero. For example, a woman with one child could have earned $ 6,200 last year, had no tax withheld and owed no tax. If she files a return, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> will mail her a check for $ 870. `` We think it is almost a crime if the people who are entitled to these benefits do n't obtain them,'' <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, executive assistant to the president of the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>, told the news conference. The labor federation and several of its union are participating in the campaign. Young noted that both spouses in a family could earn the minimum wage -LRB- about $ 6,900 each -RRB- and the family could still qualify for a substantial credit. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Daly </PERSON>, head of domestic social policy for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, said each of the nation's 189 dioceses will be asked to spread the word about the credit, including using inserts in church bulletins. The campaign also seeks to inform eligible families that they can receive the credit in their paychecks throughout the year rather than having to wait until the end of the year for a lump-sum payment. Fewer than 1 percent of the families eligible for the credit receive the advance payments. <PERSON> Greenstein </PERSON> also noted that a person who was eligible for the credit before 1988 but failed to claim it may be able to file retroactively and receive the benefit for up to three years in the past.

 The stock market finished higher today in active trading, rebounding briskly late in the session. Analysts said the market succumbed early today to profit-taking in the wake of last week's impressive rally, which continued on Monday. `` We're pretty overbought,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicoski </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jaffray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Hopwood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. `` It just looks like we're undergoing a bout of profit-taking.'' Wall Street's bullish enthusiasm was dampened somewhat by comments today by <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, analysts said. Among other things, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that the potential threat of inflation still persists in the economy. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> chairman had made similar statements last week, but the stock and bond markets were unruffled by them at that time. After the market tested lower levels, however, it bounced back late in the day and again showed the strength characterizing its recent rally. As the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell toward the 2,300 level, a massive buying surge was said to be triggered. `` This is a market that shows resilience,'' said <PERSON> Monte </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, director of research at <ORGANIZATION> Dreyfus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The comeback reinforced market players' belief that many foreign investors and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> institutions are poised to jump on the rally bandwagon. `` I remain bullish on the market,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> DaPuzzo </PERSON>, manager of the retail equity group at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` I think the ingredients are still there for the market to continue with the rally.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday awarded a $ 459.4 million contract to <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, combining in one fixed-price contract its fiscal 1989 order for HARM missiles along with that of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The service, in a brief announcement, said it was buying 2,449 High-Speed Anti-Radiation Missiles, or HARM's, from <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION> this year. That combines an order for 1,319 for itself, another 950 for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and 180 for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said. The sale to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, worth $ 35.2 million, is the first-ever foreign sale of the weapon. The HARM missile is an air-to-ground missile used to attack enemy radars of the sort that guide anti-aircraft guns and surface-to-air missiles. The HARM guidance system is designed to automatically lock on the enemy radar's emissions. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday's contract was awarded to <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION>' <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and would be administered by its <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>. `` Delivery of these missiles will begin in December 1990 and will continue through November 1991,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said.

<HEAD>Office of Fair Trading To Investigate Complaint Against De Beers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Office of Fair Trading said Tuesday it was investigating a complaint alleging anti-competitive practices by a London-based diamond cartel controlled by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s giant De Beers diamond organization. The watchdog body said <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Beers </PERSON> `` appeared to have'' a monopoly on diamond trading in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and it was interested in establishing whether there had been an abuse of the monopoly. <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fields </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, a British mining concern with no diamond interests, acknowledged that it filed the complaint as a defensive move against a stalled takeover bid by Luxembourg-based <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> is 60.1 percent owned by <ORGANIZATION> Anglo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> De </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, the gold and diamond mining interests controlled by the Oppenheimer family of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The British government is expected to rule in the next few weeks whether to allow <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> to proceed with its 2.9 billion-pound -LRB- about $ 5.1 billion -RRB- bid for <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> following an investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> Monopolies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mergers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. A Consolidated Gold spokesman, commenting on condition he was not identified, said the company wanted to point up the `` monopolistic tendencies'' of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s Anglo-American group of companies. De Beers' Central Selling Organization, which controls 80 percent of world diamond trading, has been based in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> for 60 years. As well as selling the stones mined by <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Beers </PERSON> and other South African companies, the organization trades on behalf of diamond producers including <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The Office of Fair Trading said it would first have to establish whether it had jurisdiction over the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Selling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> because although it is based in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Beers </PERSON> is a South African company. There is no time limit on the office's investigation. After it is completed, the Office of Fair Trading may decide to refer the complaint to the <ORGANIZATION> Monopolies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mergers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Selling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> said the Office of Fair Trading notified the organization about the inquiry but had n't yet requested any information. `` It's still early'' in the investigation, said the spokesman, commenting on condition he was not identified. De Beers's shares were unchanged Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> at $ 12 -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB-.

<TEXT>
 Automakers are discriminating against the nation's automobile dealers, who must unite to make buying and selling cars a fairer game in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the president of a dealers' group said Tuesday. `` We dealers are swivel-necked from turning the other cheek, and it simply has to stop,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Tonkin </PERSON>, the 1989 president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` We want automakers to be healthy and profitable, but not by wreaking havoc on the best, most loyal friends they ever had, their dealers,'' said <LOCATION> Tonkin </LOCATION>, a dealer with 10 stores holding 14 automobile franchises in the <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, area. In his speech to about 20,000 peopel attending <ORGANIZATION> NADA </ORGANIZATION>'s annual convention, <LOCATION> Tonkin </LOCATION> singled out the subsidies from automakers to companies that buy fleets of cars. He said he wanted the makers to `` simply tell us ` We will sell to no one for less than we sell to our franchised dealers.''' But company officials for the Big Three automakers said their fleet brokers are franchised dealers. C.N. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>' vice president for customer sales and service, said from his office in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> that all <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s fleet sales are through franchised dealers, except for sales to the federal government `` These people that <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Tonkin </PERSON> was talking to today are the people who deliver all these cars to fleet customers,'' <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Windecker </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Houston </PERSON> each said their companies' fleet sales are arranged through dealers. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s cars for the federal government must go through dealers, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> sells directly to the federal government and the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. But <LOCATION> Tonkin </LOCATION> said dealers who handle fleet sales frequently handle only the paperwork associated with them, not the vehicles themselves. `` While technically what they're saying is correct,'' <LOCATION> Tonkin </LOCATION> said, `` after you go out beyond the dealer that's doing the paperwork, there are dealers who are damning it.'' Automaker officials declined to say how much a subsidy might be worth to a dealer. Around 20 percent of the industry's sales, roughly 1.6 million cars a year, are to fleet customers, the companies said. On other matters, <LOCATION> Tonkin </LOCATION>: _ Called on automakers to pay for space in their showrooms like food and beverage makers pay for shelf space in grocery stores _ Said he was forming a task force to meet with manufacturers hoping to find a way to make customer satisfaction indexes more uniform <LOCATION> Tonkin </LOCATION> said the indexes sometimes discriminate against dealers and should be standardized for the industry. _ Simplify warranties to make them more understandable for car buyers and sellers

 The onslaught of colder weather and an expected drop in meat demand during Lent influenced futures prices for some farm commodities Tuesday, analysts said. Grain and soybean prices were up sharply on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Prices were bolstered by unexpectedly high weekly export inspection figures and a report from <ORGANIZATION> Sparks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodities </ORGANIZATION>, a private crop analyst, that pegged <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s soybean crop lower than <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> estimates, said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` A weather forecast calling for bitter cold temperatures in wheat growing areas supported the wheat prices,'' said <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Luth </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Wheat settled 3 \ cents to 6 -RCB- cents higher, with the contract for delivery in March at $ 4.40 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 3 -RCB- cents to 7 \ cents higher, with March at $ 2.74 -RCB- a bushel; oats were 6 cents to 6 -RCB- cents higher, with March at $ 2.21 -RCB- a bushel; and soybeans were 4 cents to 12 -RCB- cents higher, with March at $ 7.72 -RCB- a Livestock and meat futures prices were mostly higher on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Cash prices were helpful for both cattle and hog futures, said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gidel </PERSON>, general analyst with G.H. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, but enthusiasm was limited by the propect of diminished consumer demand for meat during Lent, a 40-day religious period which begins Feb. 8. `` The cold weather forecast has been a factor in the marketplace,'' said <PERSON> Gidel </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` There should be less farmer movement of animals to market once the colder temperatures set in.'' Cattle settled .10 cent to .42 cent higher, with the contract for delivery in February at 74.72 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .08 cent to .30 cent higher, with March at 84.47 cents a pound; live hogs were .05 cent to .80 cent higher, with February at 43.35 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were .25 cent lower to 1.00 cent higher, with February at 39.52 cents a pound. Precious metal prices were lower for the fourth straight session on the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` The further declines were in response to strong dollar gains, which were accomplished by -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman -RRB- <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>'s anti-inflationary statements to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> today,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Steel </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.

 The dollar surged to three-month highs Tuesday after <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit would shrink in coming months without a decline in the dollar's value Gold prices, meanwhile, fell to their lowest level in two years, continuing the downward trend that began last Friday when they broke below $ 400 an ounce. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> also said that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts to boost interest rates would not lead to a recession, but would extend the current expansion by keeping inflation under control. Currency dealers took the remarks to mean that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> central bank was unconcerned by the dollar's recent rise and was willing to keep interest rates tight, something that would make dollar-denominated investments attractive. `` It was <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> today,'' said <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtin </PERSON>, assistant treasurer of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Australia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Testifying before the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> also reiterated his statement of last week that the current rate of inflation is too high and said he expects a further substantial contraction in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit. Dealers have been focusing on firm <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates this year rather than the budget and trade deficits that preoccupied them last year. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar fell 0.60 yen to a closing 129.13.

<TEXT>
 Energy futures prices declined Tuesday due to weather and other factors as investors awaited new statistics on domestic petroleum supplies. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the March contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, fell 26 cents to close at $ 17.03 after falling 45 cents on Monday. Among refined products, the February contract for unleaded gasoline lost 1.16 cents to settle at 47.72 cents a gallon, while domestic heating oil slumped 0.31 cent to a settlement price of 52.28 cents a gallon. The prices of other contract months also declined. Traders said the reopening of the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> pipeline after a partial closing on Monday due to sub-freezing temperatures, contributed to the drop in heating oil prices. Near-month contract prices had jumped on Monday as investors anticipated a surge in demand due to the partial shutdown as well as the blast of cold temperatures that hit the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Heating oil and gasoline prices also lost ground as investors adjusted their positions on the last day of the February contract, analysts said. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiedler </PERSON>, chief energy broker for <ORGANIZATION> E.D. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Man </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the decline in crude prices was due partly to technical corrections following several weeks of steadily rising prices since November's agreement by the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> Exporting Countries. The accord, which took effect Jan. 1 and extends for six months, set an oil production quota of 18.5 million barrels a day for the 13 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members. At the time the accord was reached, <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> was producing more than 22 million barrels, far more than the market could absorb. The excess forced prices to the $ 12 range, below the $ 18 benchmark price set by <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>. Traders said they also anticipated a buildup in energy stocks when the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> released its weekly report after the close of trading on Tuesday.

 The stock market finished higher Tuesday after rebounding briskly late in the trading session. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 18.21 points to 2,342.32, its highest close since the October 1987 market crash and its third straight finish over 2,300 since the collapse. The widely watched blue-chip barometer had lost as much as 15 points earlier in the day. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by nearly 2-to-1 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 960 up, 541 down and 493 unchanged. `` This is a market that shows resilience,'' said <PERSON> Monte </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, director of research at <ORGANIZATION> Dreyfus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The comeback reinforced market players' belief that many foreign investors and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> institutions have been reassured by a strong dollar and apparently sound economy _ and are ready to jump on the Wall Street bandwagon that began rolling last week. `` I remain bullish on the market,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> DaPuzzo </PERSON>, manager of the retail equity group at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` I think the ingredients are still there for the market to continue with the rally.'' Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 194.05 million shares, up from 167.83 million in Monday's session. Analysts said the market weakened early Tuesday from profit-taking in the aftermath of last week's impressive rally, which continued on Monday. Wall Street's bullish enthusiasm also was dampened somewhat by comments Tuesday by <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, analysts said. Among other things, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that the potential threat of inflation still persists in the economy. After the market tested lower levels, however, it bounced back late in the day and again showed the strength marking its recent rally. As the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell toward the 2,300 level, a massive buying surge was triggered.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, dissatisfied with its earnings, on Tuesday announced a $ 275 million streamlining program under which it will cut 2,000 jobs, trim its electronic typewriter business and stop selling medical image-making equipment. The <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, Conn.-based copier giant said a charge to cover costs of the program was recorded in the fourth quarter of 1988, resulting in a $ 77 million loss for the quarter. Without the pre-tax charge of $ 275 million, profit in the quarter would have risen 8 percent, <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> stock rose 37 -LCB- cents a share to $ 62.37 -LCB- in consolidated <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading. <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> lost money last year in electronic typewriters; document workstations; and medical image-making, which uses an unusual copying process called xeroradiography, according to <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kearns </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive. `` We are not moving as rapidly toward our objectives as we feel we must,'' <PERSON> Kearns </PERSON> said in a news conference, explaining the streamlining program. The losses were partially offset by a good reception for its new 50 Series of copiers and healthy profits in the financial services business, which accounts for 30 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> revenue, the company said. <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> said its loss in the fourth quarter contrasted with a profit of $ 155 million, or $ 1.43 a share, a year earlier. Without the charge, it said, profit would have been $ 167 million. Revenue rose 6 percent to $ 4.4 billion from $ 4.15 billion a year earlier. For all of 1988, <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> said its earnings fell 33 percent to $ 388 million, or $ 3.50 a share, from $ 578 million, or $ 5.35 a share, a year earlier. Without the fourth-quarter charge, profit would have risen 9 percent to $ 632 million. Revenue rose 9 percent to $ 16.4 billion from $ 15.1 billion. The biggest portion of the fourth-quarter charge, $ 140 million, comes from writing off excess manufacturing capacity at its electronic typewriter plant in <LOCATION> Fremont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and disengaging from the <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> business, which is based in <LOCATION> Monrovia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> will continue to provide service and supplies to existing customers of its medical equipment Another $ 100 million of the charge comes from the cost of reducing overhead and employment. <PERSON> Kearns </PERSON> said the company could not yet say how many of the 2,000 job cuts would have to be achieved by layoffs, vs. retirements or voluntary resignations. The jobs that are being eliminated are in staff rather than in sales or manufacturing, <PERSON> Kearns </PERSON> said. The cutbacks in <LOCATION> Fremont </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Monrovia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, will not involve big job cuts because employment has already been reduced there, <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> said. The company said the market for cheaper and medium-priced electronic typewriters has shrunk much faster than expected, leaving the industry with excess capacity. <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> said it hopes to cure the losses in its document workstation business by gradually dropping its own workstations and switching its software over to industry-standard workstations made by <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Microsystems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Separately, <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> said it was reorganizing its management. It said <PERSON> Wayland </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON>, an executive vice president, will head a new marketing and customer organization. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>, who was hired from <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in December, will head development and manufacturing and <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> will head a new unit, <ORGANIZATION> Integrated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION>.

 The price of <ORGANIZATION> Houghton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mifflin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> stock soared Tuesday after a group led by wealthy <PERSON> Texan </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> disclosed it recently increased its stake in the publisher to 5.6 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Bass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> said in disclosing its holdings that its latest purchase was for investment purposes, and the company pointed out that <ORGANIZATION> Bass </ORGANIZATION> had been an investor in <LOCATION> Houghton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mifflin </LOCATION> for some time. Nonetheless, Wall Streeters remembered that it was the <ORGANIZATION> Bass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>'s bid last May that led to the takeover of another publishing giant, <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, at a price about 80 percent higher than the company's stock had been trading. In <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading, <ORGANIZATION> Houghton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mifflin </ORGANIZATION> shot up $ 8.87 -LCB- a share to $ 45.25. At that price, the company's 14 million shares are valued at about $ 633 million. The Bass disclosure follows two years of sweeping changes in the publishing business that has seen <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> fall to British publisher <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Harper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Row </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> yield to <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Grolier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> sell to <ORGANIZATION> Hachette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Harcourt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jovanovich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, another publishing giant, underwent a costly recapitalization in 1987 to avoid being acquired by <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassan </PERSON>, who follows publishing companies for <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> demonstrated his interest in the publishing business with his initial <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> bid and his earlier acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Howell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an information services and publishing concern based near <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` I do n't know what his intentions are, but he has the interest and the deep pockets to acquire the whole thing if he so chose,'' <PERSON> Kassan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Boksen </PERSON>, who follows media companies for <ORGANIZATION> Raymond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Houghton </PERSON> <PERSON> Mifflin </PERSON> could command a price in the mid - $ 50 a share range should a buyout effort be made A woman answering the telephone at <ORGANIZATION> Bass </ORGANIZATION>'s offices in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, said it was company policy not to comment on its business plans. Boston-based <PERSON> Houghton </PERSON> <PERSON> Mifflin </PERSON> is a leading educational publisher and also publishes general interest books and educational and word-processing software. It ranked fourth in the nation behind <ORGANIZATION> Harcourt </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Schuster and <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> based on 1987 educational revenue, according to the trade newsletter Educational Marketer, published by <ORGANIZATION> Knowledge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Kassan </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Houghton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mifflin </LOCATION> has been a well-run company with `` a fair earnings performance'' over the past two years <LOCATION> Hougton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mifflin </LOCATION> earned $ 24.1 million, or $ 1.70 a share, on revenue of $ 368.3 million in 1988. Nonetheless, <PERSON> Kassan </PERSON> said the company is vulnerable to a takeover because it has a relatively small amount of its stock in the hands of company insiders and is `` clearly a leader'' in the elementary school reading market. The elementary school market stands to improve over the next few years, industry analysts believe, as a growing number of children reach school age. In its filing with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Bass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> said it purchased 161,200 shares of <LOCATION> Houghton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mifflin </LOCATION> stock between Jan. 10 and Jan. 27 at a prices ranging from $ 34.21 to $ 36.80 a share. It said the purchase leaves it with 790,200 common shares of <LOCATION> Houghton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mifflin </LOCATION>, or 5.6 percent of its 14 million shares. In its statement, <PERSON> Houghton </PERSON> <PERSON> Mifflin </PERSON> said, `` We do not see anything unusual in the <ORGANIZATION> Bass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>'s filing. <LOCATION> Houghton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mifflin </LOCATION> has other large stockholders, most of whom have been investors for a long time.'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON>, secretary for the company, declined comment when asked if the company's board had met to discuss the matter. The company adopted as poison-pill takeover defense plan in December. Last May, the Bass Group prpoosed to acquire <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> for $ 64 a share at a time when the company's stock had been trading at about $ 50 a share. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> acquired <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> last fall at a price of $ 90.25 a share, or about $ 2.5 billion.

<HEAD>7-Eleven To Accept Payment Of Utility Bills</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Utility customers who do n't pay by mail will soon be able to pay their bills at some 7-Eleven stores. National Payments Network of <LOCATION> Paramus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Southland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s 7-Eleven was the first national chain that had agreed to let the company install computer terminals to handle its electronic payment system. National Payments Network caters mainly to poor and elderly people who pay their utility bills with cash in person rather than sending checks by mail, according to <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, vice president for sales and marketing. Utility companies in 18 states already accept bills paid through more than 2,000 locations where the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Payments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> has outlets. Those are mostly mom' n' pop stores or small, regional chains, <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said. Four 7-Eleven stores in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area have already tested the National Payments Network system. Other markets will be added as time goes on, he said. Since 7-Eleven stores are franchised, some may choose not to participate. Although many supermarkets and other retail outlets accept payment of bills, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Payments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> gets money to billers faster because it is electronic. That can make a difference if a utility customer is threatened with cut-off. In some areas, 50 to 60 percent of all customers pay their utility bills in person, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Payments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> said in a news release.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Carlyle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a Washington-based investment partnership, on Tuesday made a new, higher offer for <ORGANIZATION> Fairchild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Chantilly </LOCATION>, Va.-based defense and space electronics contractor. <PERSON> Carlyle </PERSON> made what it called a friendly offer to purchase all outstanding shares of <ORGANIZATION> Fairchild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> at $ 16.30 per share, or more than $ 230 million assuming 14.4 million shares are outstanding. Fairchild's stock fell 25 cents a share to $ 14.75 in consolidated <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading. The new price per share is the same as <ORGANIZATION> Fairchild </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it had agreed to pay to acquire the 25 percent stake held by its largest shareholder group. Fairchild, attempting to stave off a takeover threat by the <ORGANIZATION> Carlyle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, announced Monday that it intended to buy back $ 75 million worth of stock and securities held by the big shareholder group, which is headed by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Soros </PERSON>. <PERSON> Carlyle </PERSON> countered with its offer Tuesday. It said that if the big shareholder group was getting $ 16.30 a share for its block, the rest of Fairchild shareholders were also entitled to get that much per share. `` We request that you weigh this proposal in light of your fiduciary responsibilities to shareholders, not management,'' <PERSON> Carlyle </PERSON> said in a statement. Fairchild said Monday it planned to sell the common stock it will acquire from the <ORGANIZATION> Soros </ORGANIZATION> group to its employee stock ownership plan. Fairchild said that step could make an acquisition that is not approved by the board of directors more difficult. A partnership controlled by the <ORGANIZATION> Carlyle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> owns 9.99 percent of Fairchild common shares. Its original offer was $ 15.50 a share, which amounted to a little more than $ 220 million for the common stock. The total acquisition cost to <LOCATION> Carlyle </LOCATION> under the original and new offers would be higher because of the cost of acquiring other securities or taking on Fairchild debt.

 A former junior securities analyst convicted of inside trading in a major fraud scandal will pay back more than $ 127,000 in illegal profits under an agreement approved Tuesday by a federal judge. In addition, a college friend of the 24-year-old trader, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>, was accused in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> of making $ 30,000 in profits from illegal information supplied by <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> in a separate scheme. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> approved a final settlement in which <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>, without admitting or denying wrongdoing, agreed to pay $ 127,585 to satisfy claims arising from his role in what the government has called one of the biggest inside trading frauds in history. Under the settlement between <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, a court-appointed receiver will oversee and distribute the money to cover claims by investors who said they lost money because of <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>.

In a settlement with the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> also approved Tuesday, <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> agreed to pay back $ 20,000 in illegal profits. He did not admit or deny guilt. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s civil complaint alleges that <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> violated anti-fraud provisions and received non-public information from <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> about upcoming tender offers and other pending corporate action. The alleged illegal transactions occurred via telephone between <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, who knew each other as undergraduates at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>, from July 1986 through at least September 1987, according to the complaint. `` We're saying -LRB- <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> -RRB- knew this was inside information,'' <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON> <PERSON> Larson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>, then a junior analyst with the prestigious investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, pleaded guilty to conspiring with Taiwanese businessman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> to profit in the stock market on secrets about pending corporate takeovers. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> made about $ 19 million in illicit profits and paid <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> $ 200,000. At the time, <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> also pleaded guilty to a separate, smaller insider trading scheme with an another party, now identified as <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> complaint states that <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> made at least $ 30,000 from the information and paid <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> $ 4,000. <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> allegedly traded in the securities of at least six publicly held companies: <ORGANIZATION> Lehigh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Rexnord </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Colt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Carter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hawley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Burlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The charges against <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> were first disclosed last June. At the time, the amount of allegedly illicit profits and the government's requested penalties, totaling $ 76 million, made it the second-largest securities fraud case behind the $ 100 million in illicit profits and penalties surrendered by jailed speculator <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> in 1986. The Wang case was considered important because much of the activity came during the height of publicity surrounding <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>. In December, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> agreed to plead guilty to six felonies and pay a record $ 650 million in fines in the largest securities fraud case on record.

 <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it is changing the name of its 7,400 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> service stations to `` BP'' by 1991 to better reflect its status as the largest producer of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> subsidiary of the London-based <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> now operates retail stations in 26 states under Sohio, Boron, Gulf and BP logos. `` I think BP is in many ways the invisible giant of corporate <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> president and chief executive officer. `` We are the major player in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> upstream oil, one of the most successful and innovative oil companies here and indeed worldwide. We are far bigger than houshold names in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> like <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Goodrich </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Sherwin-Williams </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. `` Upstream'' refers to the exploration and production side of the oil business, in contrast with `` downstream'' operations, which refer to refining and marketing. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> said BP <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> also has changed the names of its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exploration, refining and marketing and chemicals businesses to reflect the BP label. BP <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> operates about 750 service stations in the Northeast which are identified by the BP logo, with its green shield and two bright yellow letters. In addition, it has 1,100 Sohio stations in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, 600 Boron stations in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and western <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, and 5,000 Gulf stations in the Southeast. BP <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> acquired the Gulf stations from <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 after <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> purchased <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and sold assets to avoid antitrust problems. It also recently acquired <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> stations in three <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> states that will convert to the BP brand. <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> said it plans to redesign some of the service stations according to a new format. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> said the company `` conducted extensive research, both nationally and internationally,'' before deciding to unify its businesses under one name. He said use of the name `` BP'' in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would provide the company with a `` consistent identity.'' <LOCATION> BP </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, based in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, moved its headquarters from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> after the company purchased controlling interest in Cleveland-based <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> in 1987.

<HEAD>Tribune Co. Reports 67 Percent Jump In 4th Quarter Net Income</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday its fourth-quarter profit increased 46 percent, sparked by improved newspaper and newsprint results and a lower income tax rate. Net income for the last three months of 1988 amounted to $ 62.9 million, or 84 cents a share, compared to $ 43.2 million, or 56 cents a share, for the fourth quarter a year earlier, the company, which publishes the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement. Fourth-quarter revenue rose 8 percent to $ 625 million from $ 581 million in 1987. For the full year, net income rose 49 percent to $ 210.4 million, or $ 2.78 a share, up from $ 141.5 million, or $ 1.80 a share, for 1987. Full-year revenue rose 9 percent to $ 2.33 billion from $ 2.15 billion a year earlier. The 1987 results included pre-tax charges of $ 21.7 million for the fourth quarter and $ 40.1 million for the year relating to employee severance charges at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> said. Excluding those charges, net income per share increased 18 percent for the fourth quarter and 34 per cent for the year. The 1988 improvement reflected record operating profits and a reduction in the effective tax rate, the company said. Operating profit for the company's newspaper business rose 58 percent to $ 92.4 million as revenue rose 6 percent to $ 422 million in the fourth quarter. For the year, the newspaper oprating profit was $ 263.7 million, up 37 percent, while revenue rose 7 percent to $ 1.6 billion. Weakness in the national spot advertising market led to a 3 percent decline in television revenue for its broadcasting and entertainment group, which operates <ORGANIZATION> WGN-TV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, the company said. The group's operating profit for the fourth quarter was $ 16 million, down 4 percent from 1987, as revenue fell 1 percent to $ 126 million. For the year, the broadcasting and entertainment group's operating profit rose 24 percent to $ 77.8 million as revenue rose 4 percent to $ 506 million

 <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> urged its stockholders in full-page advertisements in major newspapers Tuesday not to sell their shares to <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which has mounted a $ 2.6 billion takeover bid. In addition, several companies that may be interested in making a competing offer for <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> have been reviewing the natural gas company's data. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors on Sunday rejected Coastal's $ 42-a-share bid `` Coastal's offer of $ 42 per share is inadequate. Therefore: Do not be stampeded into any hasty decision,'' the ads in the <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION>, The <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> and the Wall Street Journal state. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Wichlep </PERSON> declined to comment on the number of firms that have reviewed the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> data. `` All I can tell you is that the data rooms were open on Saturday, Sunday and Monday, and we have had people in them every day,'' <PERSON> Wichlep </PERSON> said Monday. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, a Houston-based natural gas transmission company, said last week it planned to contact about 50 companies it believed may be interested in making a competing offer to the bid by Houston-based Coastal. <PERSON> Wichlep </PERSON> said no special efforts are being used to screen potential competing bidders. Each company, however, is required to sign a confidentiality agreement.

<HEAD>Du Pont Gets Patent for CFC Replacements</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has received a patent on a compound blend that could accelerate the replacement of halogenated chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, which damage the earth's ozone layer, a spokesman said Tuesday. The company said the three-component blends of environmentally acceptable compounds will have no adverse effects on the environment, compared to CFC-12, one of the products suspected of depleting the ozone layer. <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> is the largest maker of CFCs in the world and has said it will cease making the chemicals by the end of the century. Scientists say CFCs have the potential to damage the environment, including decreasing the ozone layer, a shield that protects the earth from ultraviolet light. Under the Montreal Protocol treaty, countries producing CFCs have agreed to reduce <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> production by 50 percent by 1998. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has signed the agreement. The new blends could be used for existing medium-temperature food display cases, vending machines, water coolers, home refrigerators and freezers, and automobile air conditioners _ all of which make up about 30 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> market in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The new blends would gradually be placed in items that use CFCs as they wear out. `` Otherwise we would not be able to phase out production -LRB- of CFCs -RRB- until all the equipment was off the market,'' said <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> manager of the alternative development program. `` We will still work to find an alternative for new equipment. This would go in parallel with it,'' he said. `` We have received a patent on the technology which says the blend works. But it will take a couple of years to test it in operating systems to define all the changes that might be required in a refrigerator or car and then we have to finish the process development,'' <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> said. The new technology was made public Monday at a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heating </ORGANIZATION>, Refrigeration and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conditioning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Candidate components for the blends include HCFC-22, HFC-152a and HCFC-124. <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> said HCFC-124 is a new product. `` Mix those three together and you get something very close to what we had with CFC-12 as far as performance,'' he said. <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> said the blends were more energy efficient than HFC-134a, the leading single-product candidate alternative for CFCs. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> plans to introduce a series of alternative products in a three - to five-year period beginning in 1990 Complete phaseout of CFCs may take until the turn of the century, the company said.

<TEXT>
 Car dealers from both sides of the world have some straightforward advice for their <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> friends _ learn how to sell used cars. More than 100 auto dealers and manufacturers representatives from 16 foreign countries were among thousands of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automobile dealers who attended the 72nd annual convention of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which ended Tuesday. Visiting dealers from <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, with almost the same words, said they were struck by how little attention <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dealers paid to selling cars that have some miles on them. `` You have no idea how to sell a used car,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> dealer from <LOCATION> Melbourne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. `` I think we can teach the Americans how to sell them.'' `` I think we can sell a used car better than you can,'' said <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> <PERSON> Winter </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> dealer from <LOCATION> Newcastle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. In separate interviews, White and Winter said used-car sales make up half or more of their dealership volumes, and speculated that the difference may be because <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drivers do n't treat their cars as well. <ORGANIZATION> NADA </ORGANIZATION> figures show that used-car sales accounted for 6.3 percent of all vehicle sales in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1987, the latest year for which figures are available. Two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> auto dealers said the proliferation of used-car auction houses and used-car businesses not affiliated with a franchised operation is probably the reason. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Dudley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, who sells <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Cadillac </ORGANIZATION> and Oldsmobile cars, said there was discussion at the <ORGANIZATION> NADA </ORGANIZATION> convention about preparing a car for resale. <ORGANIZATION> Bayer </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Grindstaff </PERSON>, owner of <PERSON> Grindstaff </PERSON> <PERSON> Chevrolet </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Elizabethton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, said in interviews that the condition of a trade-in is a major consideration of whether the car is kept on the dealer's used-car lot or sold elsewhere. Prices also are a big difference in cars sold in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and overseas, the dealers said. Governmental regulations and duties jack up the prices of cars in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> sometimes by 100 percent, <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. He added the regulations also make some vehicles too expensive for him and his fellow dealers to handle. `` We'd love to have these vans,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> said after seeing some of the customized van conversion displays on the <ORGANIZATION> NADA </ORGANIZATION> show floor. `` But you ca n't get them in.''

<HEAD>Contracting For New Construction Rebounds 8 Percent In December</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Contracting for new construction rebounded 8 percent in December, marking a departure from the general sluggishness of 1988, according to a report Tuesday. `` Despite its strong finish, 1988 was a year of generally softening construction activity, as the value of all newly started work fell 2 percent short of the 1987 peak,'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>, vice president and chief economist of F.W. <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement. <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> said the 1988 decline ended a five-year period of continuously expanding construction contracting. He predicted the market would decline again this year. The big factors in the drop were overbuilt commercial properties and limited public funding, according to F.W. Dodge, a unit of <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. An additional factor this year is higher interest rates, <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> said Construction of highways and other public works projects contributed to an 18 percent increase in the non-building category in December over November. For the year, the category fell 1 percent from 1987. Residential building rose 7 percent in December but was about even for the year. Contracting for non-residential buildings rose 4 percent in December but was down 5 percent for the year.

<HEAD>Robert Bass Busiest Of Wealthy Brothers</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Houghton Mifflin</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The billionaire Bass brothers are often described as classic passive investors, but their business ventures have kept them among the nation's 400 richest people. The Bass dynasty traces its roots to the forays of wildcatter <PERSON> Sid </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, who made a series of successful oil strikes in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Upon his death in 1959, he willed most of his money to his partner and nephew, <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bass </PERSON>. After vastly expanding <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>'s holdings, <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> retired in the late 1960s and left the family empire to his four sons, who each inherited $ 2.8 million. They combined assets to form <ORGANIZATION> Bass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION>, which was managed by eldest son, <PERSON> Sid </PERSON> <PERSON> Bass </PERSON>. With bold moves from the oil patch into stocks and real estate, the brothers added to their collective and individual fortunes. Among their most lucrative ventures, the Basses netted an $ 850 million capital gain after helping to thwart a 1985 takeover fight for <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Also that year, the family liquidated <ORGANIZATION> Bass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION>, its primary investment vehicle, and divided the assets four ways, freeing the brothers to cut some individual deals Since then, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> has focused much of his energy on the information sector. In 1985, he led a group that made a $ 205 million investment in Cincinnati-based <ORGANIZATION> Taft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> that was worth $ 718 million two years later. He and two other shareholders divided <PERSON> Taft </PERSON>'s assets, with the Bass group getting $ 157.5 million in cash, a television station in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and two large cable television properties. In 1988, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> was instrumental in prying away the <LOCATION> Westin </LOCATION> hotel chain from <ORGANIZATION> Allegis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 1.53 billion. In March, he sold the Plaza Hotel in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> to fellow billionaire <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> for $ 410 million. Last May 17, he reached an agreement to purchase <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Howell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a publishing information services company in <LOCATION> Skokie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. On the same day, a group that he led proposed to buy <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION> The move put the publishing giant in play and it was acquired last fall by British publisher <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> for $ 2.5 billion and gave the <ORGANIZATION> Bass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> a gain of about $ 75 million on its holdings before expenses. Most recently, the <ORGANIZATION> Bass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> put up $ 350 million for the bailout of insolvent <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The brothers zealously guard their privacy, persistently refusing interviews and shunning transactions that would require much financial disclosure. They have been described as atypical <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> tycoons with their conservative style and reserved manner. In <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, they are universally revered for their civic investments. <PERSON> Sid </PERSON> is director of the generous <PERSON> Sid </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> Foundation. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> often described as the family maverick, has been more interested in arts and environmental projects. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> is working with <PERSON> Sid </PERSON>, while <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> has taken an interest in some political projects. `` The big difference in the Basses _ and most people like the Basses _ is that they're really not looking for any credit for what they do. They do it because they think it's what they should do and what's good,'' said <PERSON> Dee </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> lawyer and longtime family friend. Despite their financial muscle, the Basses are n't the strong-arming type, preferring to work with the management of target companies, as they did in the Disney situation, <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> noted.

 Foreign investment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which soared to a record of $ 58.1 billion reported in 1987, is set to go even higher for 1988 according to <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Apcar </PERSON>, director of investment analysis at the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` How much the increase will be depends on the data we're still collecting for the last few months of the year,'' he said in an interview Tuesday. `` It was about $ 30 billion for the first half of 1988, and I'd guess about $ 20 billion for the first half of 1987.

That was about $ 6.6 billion. In 1987 <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> spent nearly $ 8 billion for the 45 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> that it did not already own. That put the total of British acquisitions for the year at $ 21.2 billion. Figures were identified for only 117 of the 249 transactiona. As has been the case for the past three years, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was the most active investor with 490 separate deals. Of these, 235 carried idenifiable prices totalling 13 billion. `` While <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> will continue to be the source for most Asian investments for the foreseeable future, it is interesting to note that other Asian-Pacific investors, especially from <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, have increased their activity here -- the number of transactions doubled and the value quadrupled in 1987,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s report. It was issued last Friday. `` Foreign investment makes an important contribution to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy,'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON>, named by President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as his top economic adviser, said last week. `` By helping to build productive plant and equipment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, foreign investment contributes to current and future increases in jobs, productivity and growth ... `` Concerns about foreign ownership are somewhat exaggerated. By the end of 1987, measured net foreign assets in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> amounted to some 3.1 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> netwealth on an historical cost basis.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s report said the trend toward the growth of foreign investment began in 1983, with the recovery from the recession of the previous two years. The total number of deals had peaked at about 1,200 in 1981 and then dropped sharply. In 1987 the total was 1,328, with values reported for 588 of them. That was an increase of 26 percent over the year before. The report attributed the big rise since 1983 to: _ The drop in the international price of the dollar after 1985, which made it cheaper for foreigners to buy in this country _ Eagerness by many <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> firms to become more profitable and avoid takeovers by getting rid of divisions and subsidiaries they no longer wanted _ Tthe belief by foreign investors that they must invest in the world's largest consumer market in order to stay competiive in <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON> said that although the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has become a debtor country -- with larger assets owned here by foreigners than Americans own in other countries -- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> direct investment in actual property and equipment remains greater than foreign direct investment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The figures are reversed when indirect investments such as stocks and bonds are tasken into account.

 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and lawyers representing thousands of black employees in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> announced Tuesday they had tentatively settled a bias suit against the automaker that could give the plaintiffs payments totaling $ 3 million. The two sides agreed upon a proposed consent decree to end the case, but <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> did not admit it had discriminated against blacks in promotions and pay raises, company spokeswoman <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Molloy </PERSON> said. The proposal provides for distribution of $ 1.6 million to about 2,800 former <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> employees, and raises averaging $ 1,000 a year for about 1,000 current employees, plaintiffs' attorney <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> said. <PERSON> James </PERSON> told a news conference the proposed decree also requires five years of monitoring to ensure that black salaried employees get their fair share of promotions and pay increases. <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, another attorney for the plaintiffs, said the tentative agreement `` reaffirms the importance of class-action civil rights litigation, especially in the current unfriendly political climate towards civil rights in general.'' The suit, filed in 1983 by four employees, was a class action on behalf of 10,000 salaried black employees who worked for <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> between 1982 and 1986 in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. Those states were chosen for the suit because <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> employees there made a manageable-sized group for the legal action, and because <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> plants and offices in those states account for 75 percent of the company's salaried employees, <PERSON> James </PERSON> said. Members of the class will be notified of the proposed agreement over the next two weeks and be given a chance to lodge any objections they may have. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Feikens </PERSON> then will schedule a hearing on whether the decree should be approved, <PERSON> James </PERSON> said. The decree was submitted to <PERSON> Feikens </PERSON> about two weeks ago and <PERSON> Feikens </PERSON> gave his preliminary approval Tuesday, <PERSON> James </PERSON> said. `` This will help blacks to achieve a more equitable position in upper management and also middle management,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, one of the four original plaintiffs. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, now pastor of <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carmel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Flint </LOCATION>, was employed at <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> AC </ORGANIZATION> sparkplug subsidiary in <LOCATION> Flint </LOCATION>. He told the news conference that after starting in 1956, he worked his way up from janitor to supervisor of warehousing and shipping at the AC plant, but found that whites had better paychecks and higher job expectations. Also present were two other original plaintiffs, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodson </PERSON>, sales engineer at <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Allison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transmission </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kitchen </PERSON>, an employee of <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s Chevrolet-Pontiac-GM of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> group in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, who both reported similar experiences The fourth plaintiff, <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Huguley </PERSON>, formerly on <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s design staff in <LOCATION> Warren </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, left <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> for a job with <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benz </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> said.

 Federal aviation officials ordered airlines Tuesday to inspect all of four types of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> airliners built in the last eight years after wiring mix-ups were found on four more planes. In its most far-reaching order to date on the possibility of cross-wiring and cross-plumbing in airline safety systems, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> gave airlines 25 days to complete the testing of both engine and cargo hold safety systems in 741 aircraft. `` This will easily affect most airlines,'' said <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON>. The inspections were ordered for 472 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s, 33 Jumbo 747s, 123 757s and 113 767s manufactured after Dec. 31, 1980. Previous <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> orders prompted by the discovery of fouled-up wiring or plumbing in several <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> aircraft throughout the world were limited only to plumbing and wiring on individual types of airliners. Wiring and plumbing problems became the subject of <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> orders after British authorities speculated the pilot of a British <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> 737 was deceived into shutting down his only good engine in a crash that killed 44 people in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> Jan. 8. Authorities have not concluded what caused both engines to be shut down in the British plane, but since the crash, cross-wiring of engine or cargo hold fire warning systems has been found in other planes. Inspections ordered earlier by British authorities covered <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> A320s as well as <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s, but faulty wiring has been found only in <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> aircraft, all of which are built in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiminez </PERSON> said the aircraft builder had no immediate comment on the latest order. Officials of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and several airlines had said they agreed with previous orders as prudent measures to ensure safety. The newly ordered tests are not expected to disrupt airline schedules and can be completed anytime over the next 3 -LCB- weeks while the airliners are undergoing routine maintenance. Under the `` airworthiness directive'' issued by the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> office, airlines are ordered to repair and report any defects to the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> said the four additional problems were found either during work done under previous directives or in independent testing by airlines. They included faulty wiring on three 757s, he said, including one case of an incomplete circuit that would have kept a fire extinguisher from operating and two cases of cross-wiring. One would have indicated the wrong engine was overheating and the other would have set off the fire extinguisher to the wrong engine, <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> said. The fourth case involved cross-wiring that would have indicated fire in the wrong engine of a 737, he said. <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> said that while foreign airlines flying <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> aircraft are not required to follow the directives, most of them will conduct the tests.

 The second trial of <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on stock manipulation charges opened in federal court in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> Tuesday. `` This is a case about cheating in the stock market,'' Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowenson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> told the jury picked for the second trial. <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION>, a major manufacturer of specialty chemicals and building materials, and its vice chairman, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON>, were indicted last July for allegedly manipulating the stock of <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in 1986.

 <ORGANIZATION> Centaur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, stymied in its $ 765 million effort to buy <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday that holders of more than 34 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION>'s stock have called for a shareholders meeting, at which Centaur hoped to replace the chemical company's board <ORGANIZATION> Centaur </ORGANIZATION> said it had delivered to <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> proxies from shareholders owning approximately 34.6 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION>'s outstanding stock Under <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> law, a special meeting must be called if one is requested by the holders of at least 20 percent of a company's outstanding voting stock. State law requires the company to call the meeting within two months of the request, <ORGANIZATION> Centaur </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> officials said they were `` in the process of reviewing the demands to determine whether they have been submitted by the requisite shareholders and whether they are in a form that would be effective.'' At the meeting, <ORGANIZATION> Centaur </ORGANIZATION> said, <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> shareholders would be asked to remove the directors, reduce the board from 11 to five members and eliminate the requirement that directors also be shareholders. In addition, the shareholders would be asked to elect five new directors proposed by Centaur. Candidates nominated by Centaur would likely be more sympathetic to the partnership's offer. Centaur, whoise principals are <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> financiers <PERSON> Abbey </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> and <PERSON> Melvyn </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrin </PERSON>, launched a $ 100-a-share bid in mid-December for the 6.98 million shares of common stock it did not own. At the time, the group owned about 12.7 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION>'s shares In an effort to thwart the bid, <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> spent $ 403.8 million to buy 4.75 million shares, or about 40 percent of those outstanding. <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> stock closed Tuesday at $ 106 a share, up 25 cents in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite trading. <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> is fighting the Centaur bid in court, claiming disclosures made by the group in its tender offer and the solicitation of proxies from <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION>'s shareholders were false and misleading.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar maintained its strength against the Japanese yen Wednesday while share prices plunged, discouraged by the yen's weakness, dealers said. The dollar, which opened at 130.58 yen, up a strong 1.45 yen from Tuesday's 129.13-yen finish, moved mainly between 130.30 -.67 during the early session It was changing hands at a slightly lower 130.32 yen shortly after midmorning.

Currency dealers said the strong dollar opening in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> followed an overnight surge in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> which was prompted by comments from <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> who said current exchange rates were tolerable.

 Banks and savings institutions were braced Tuesday for a possible proposal from the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to raise their insurance premiums as a way to rescue the government fund that insures savings and loan associations. A White House official said Tuesday night the prevailing thought in the administration is that such an approach `` is one of the more attractive'' solutions. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity said that increased risk for the insurer should translate into higher premiums for the institutions. White House officials were convened in a meeting late Tuesday by chief of staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> in a meeting that focused on what recommendations to make to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on the S & amp; L situation. ` Things are a little scary to us,'' said <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Guenther </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Guenther </PERSON> said he interpreted comments over the weekend by <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> as indicating the administration was backing away from its controversial suggestion that depositors pay a fee of about 25 cents on every $ 100 in their accounts. Meanwhile, several members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> called for a quick infusion of $ 2 billion into the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> so that regulators could liquidate more insolvent S & amp; Ls while <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> debates proposed reforms. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, responding to questions in a Sunday television interview, had defended the deposit fee idea as if he were talking about an increase in the premium that institutions have been paying since 1934. He `` seemed to be moving away from a deposit fee to an increase in banks' premiums,'' <PERSON> Guenther </PERSON> said in an interview. Senior administration officials are saying they will urge President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to propose a premium hike rather than a fee aid by depositors, according to Tuesday's editions of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, which cited unidentified sources, and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> intends to present at least an outline of his <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L plan when he addresses <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Feb. 9. So far he has indicated no preference among the many options. `` If I were to make a prediction, my guess is those premiums are going up,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>. `` Somebody's going to end up having to pay them. My guess is it will probably be the institutions, but the depositors will pay them indirectly. `` We'll bury this -LRB- deposit fee -RRB- proposal on the one hand and dig it up through another hole,'' he said. The administration has told members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> it likely will propose selling bonds for about $ 45 billion. The difficulty comes in raising the $ 7 billion to $ 9 billion needed each year to pay off the bonds. The S & amp; L industry and many members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> advocate using tax money, an alternative the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is trying to avoid. <PERSON> Guenther </PERSON> said an increase in premiums for both banks and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls would be unfair because about two-thirds of the money generated for <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls would come from banks. He estimated that a 25-cent increase in banks' 8.3-cent premium would push as many as 750 profitable banks into the red. To the extent that banks and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls pass on the cost to their customers through lower interest rates on deposits, it would encourage depositors to put their money in uninsured money market mutual funds offered by brokerage firms, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION>, the largest S & amp; L trade association, has said it can not pay more toward the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION>'s problems and at the same time raise more capital from investors as a buffer between losses and insured deposits. At the congressional hearings, Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>., noting an estimate that insolvent S & amp; Ls are losing $ 1 billion a month, said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should give regulators about $ 2 billion immediately so they can liquidate some institutions rather than rescuing them with promissory notes and loss guarantees `` I have to believe that an immediate infusion of about $ 2 billion for the next six months or so would save us money in the long run,'' he said. Sen. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, agreed, saying, `` It's probably going to be six, seven, eight months at best'' until <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> acts on a reform package. Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., while not specifically backing <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>'s proposal, said, `` I think we have to consider acting more rapidly. The committee chairman, Sen. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, D-Mich., is against spending any money on the problem without tying it to reforms needed to prevent the problem from reoccurring But he said regulators were free to ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for more money. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Fulwider </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, said the agency would wait until the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration presented its proposal before deciding whether to ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for interim financing. The bank board has already advocated that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> allow it to speed up the sale of the remaining $ 5 billion in previously authorized bonds rather than spread the borrowing through 1990, as now required.
