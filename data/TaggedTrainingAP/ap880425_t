 Three tobacco companies in a cigarette liability suit will ask again for a mistrial following a judge's opinion that narrowed the claims against them, lawyers said Monday Lawyers for <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Lorillard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> will file papers this week for a mistrial in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON>'s ruling last Thursday, said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parrish </PERSON>, a lawyer for <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Lorillard </ORGANIZATION>. The companies have sought at least four mistrials since court proceedings began Feb. 1 and twice have sought to have <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON> removed from the case. All those efforts were unsuccessful. <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON> last week dismissed charges brought by <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> on behalf of his wife, <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, who died of lung cancer at age 58 in 1984 after four decades of smoking the defendants' cigarettes. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> had charged that the companies caused his wife's death by failing to market a safer product or do enough research on smoking. Although the judge ruled there was not enough evidence to support the claims, he decided that the evidence could lead to a finding that the companies engaged in conspiracy to cover up the dangers of smoking. The companies say the jury could not decide fairly on the remaining contentions because so much evidence on the safer cigarette and research issues has been introduced. <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON> also let stand allegations that <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> failed to warn Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> about the dangers of cigarettes, but threw out the charge against <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Lorillard </ORGANIZATION> because she did not smoke their cigarettes after 1966, when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> mandated warnings on cigarette packs.

<TEXT>
 Twenty-seven union members began a fast Monday as part of the two-month-old strike by thousands of construction workers demanding that the government grant wage increases and better working conditions. About 4,500 construction workers belonging to four opposition labor groups have been on strike since Feb. 25. The 27 hunger strikers began their fast at the General Workers Confederation headquarters in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunez </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> and the Sandinista government's representative in talks with domestic opposition groups, called plans for the hunger strike `` a political publicity show.'' The construction workers went on strike after the leftist government decreed new wage scales and raised prices for basic staples on Feb. 14 as part of reforms intended to combat inflation, which reached 1,500 percent last year. Government officials have called the strike illegal, and Labor Minister <PERSON> Benedicto </PERSON> <PERSON> Meneses </PERSON> said only 600 workers have walked off their jobs. Monday night, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said negotiations with the strikers had been suspended. A statement said the unions were seeking `` to return to former payment systems that were eliminated precisely because they ran against the logic of the economic reform measures.'' It called on the strikers to return to work `` with the guarantee they wo n't be the object of any reprisals.'' The strike was called by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Confederation </ORGANIZATION>, the Autonomous Workers Central of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Confederation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> and Unity Central. They claim a membership of 100,000. There was no immediate response from the government to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s message to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Monday in which he threatened to expand the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embargo against <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. But on Sunday, President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said that if the embargo continued, the Sandinistas would prohibit further shipments from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of equipment and other assistance to Nicaraguan organizations. The embargo had been set to expire April 30. It permits <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid and independent donations of supplies to `` democratic organizations,'' including newsprint and equipment for the opposition newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 A lawyer for rock singer <PERSON> Mick </PERSON> <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> said Monday that there was only the `` barest, scintilla of evidence'' that <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> ever heard a song he is accused of pirating in his 1985 hit `` Just Another Night.'' A federal court jury got the case Monday and deliberated 3 -LCB- hours before retiring for the evening. The jury listened to several tapes and reviewed <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON>'s travel schedule for early 1983, when reggae musician <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Alley </PERSON>'s song was broadcast in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> area. Testimony showed <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> was in the area for five days in January and February of that year. Alley is suing <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON>, maintaining that <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> infringed on his copyright of a song with the same name. Two alternate jurors, who were dismissed at start of deliberations, said it seemed to them that <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> had developed his song independently. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Parcher </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON>'s lawyers, said the only similarity between <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON>'s song and <PERSON> Alley </PERSON>'s 1979 song were the title and the theme of a man spending one more night with a woman, which is `` certainly not original.'' <PERSON> Parcher </PERSON> said there was only the `` barest, barest, scintilla of evidence'' that <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> ever heard <PERSON> Alley </PERSON>'s song and added that his client had `` no motive to steal <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Alley </PERSON>'s song.'' <PERSON> Alley </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Alley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> had several mutual friends and acquaintances, and said the songs' similar choruses were `` the certain spark that made the songs memorable. If the jury decides <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> infringed upon <PERSON> Alley </PERSON>'s copyright, damages would be decided in a second trial unless a settlement were reached. <PERSON> Alley </PERSON>'s lawyers say <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> netted as much as $ 6 million from the song.

 <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON>'s, whose clubby confines have provided refuge for a generation of creative minds and famous faces, celebrated its first quarter-century Monday with a celebrity bash. <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON>, the rotund proprietress who rewards loyalty and fame with choice tables, expected her `` nice, neighborhood restaurant'' to be filled with people whose names have filled gossip columns for years. For the party, the checked-cloth-covered tables were removed, the ceiling was filled with balloons, and rotating spotlights were set up outside. A crowd of onlookers watched as celebrities filed by: <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Segal </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Lumet </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawford </PERSON>, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Maas </PERSON>, <PERSON> Eli </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, <PERSON> Iman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Chung </PERSON>, <PERSON> Raquel </PERSON> <PERSON> Welch </PERSON>, <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dee </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiegs </PERSON>, <PERSON> Halston </PERSON>, <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Southern </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kosinski </PERSON>. `` The Eighth Avenue subway at rush hour is a picnic compared to this,'' said <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> in the jam-packed interior. `` These people are used to being treated like kings here. Tonight they are treated like cockroaches.'' And this was early by <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON>'s standards: 10 p.m. `` This place is a living <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>,'' said bartender <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>. But a glitzy night of revelry is hardly what the regulars think of when they think of <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON>'s. A comfortable tavern chockablock with posters, photos and book covers donated by its celebrated clientele, <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON>'s has evolved from a writer's and artists' hangout to a required stop in the city's see-and-be-seen circuit. Saturday night was typical: <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Finney </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paloma </PERSON> <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON>, among others. <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> was there a couple of weeks ago. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> opened his cinematic valentine to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, `` <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>,'' with a scene set in <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON>'s. He's a regular, <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> said, because `` He loves to people-watch. It's comfortable, nobody bothers him, we make him what he wants.'' The food, critics love to point out, is undistinguished. It's the restaurant `` where you get the least for your money,'' according to the Zagat Restaurant Survey And its reputation, deserved or not, is that service can be rude and inattentive if you've never made the best-seller list. Even writer <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Plimpton </PERSON>, among the most loyal of regulars, said, `` I'm afraid you do n't get treated very well if you do n't have a pencil in your top pocket.'' Nevertheless, it usually fills up by 9 p.m. with stars, stargazers, yuppies and just neighborhood folks. Those at the bar can nurse $ 3.50 beers and watch the scene. In a city where formality sometimes chokes the fun out of a meal, <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON>'s is a relaxing, familiar retreat, its regulars say. `` It offers an ambience of camaraderie that is centered on <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> herself _ she's the den mother there,'' said author <PERSON> Gay </PERSON> <PERSON> Talese </PERSON>, adding: `` It's like a boarding house, you've got the round table, and you do n't need a reservation, if you're a friend of hers.'' If you're not, you'll sit farther back. Detractors and celebrity-watchers alike make too big a deal out of the place, <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> said. `` I think a lot of people just come in to have dinner,'' she said. `` And you have a good time. A good bottle of wine, a nice plate of pasta _ I mean, that's life.'' When she plunked down $ 10,000 for the bar in 1963, she already knew some show folk, writers and artists from her days as a waitress and cafe manager in <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>. `` Actually, what I did was just bring the Village uptown,'' she said. `` Then, it was barely going, a rather sleepy place up there,'' <PERSON> Plimpton </PERSON> recalled. `` Friends got their friends to go. It was just one room, very quiet, and we would play darts. `` <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> made sure it was a very informal, non-frantic atmosphere. Now it's a bit different, and more expensive.'' Overall, however, it's much the same as it was 25 years ago, said <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON>. Regulars can count on a good table, and count on her being there. `` I'm not changing it all the time,'' she said. `` I'm not going with the current trend.''

 A group of Panamanian dissidents is planning to undertake a military operation against strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> by the beginning of next week, an opposition leader said Monday. Ambassador <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON>, who has maintained his loyalty to ousted President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, told reporters the group is made up of very knowledgeable officers who have many friends in the Panamanian Defense Forces, or PDF. <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> gave no details, but the group apparently is comprised of high-ranking defectors from the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> who came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> shortly after <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s crisis erupted two months ago with <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s ouster. One is <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Col. <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Villalaz </PERSON>, who has been living in exile in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for the past five weeks. He claimed that he and other <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> pilots flew more than 90,000 pounds of weapons from <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> before he defected. <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON>, who has refused to relinquish the embassy to a replacement envoy appointed by the new government in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, said the dissident group has set up a `` military command'' and has `` intimate knowledge'' of the Defense Forces. `` We are very confident that the military actions will have the help, the support of people within the PDF,'' <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> said. `` This is an asset we never had before.'' A military coup attempt against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> last month was put down quickly. Asked why he was disclosing a planned military operation at a news conference, <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is aware that his opponents will not give up the struggle against him. He indicated that he did not believe that the disclosure would hurt the chances for the success of the plan. <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> said the plan is being worked out on the assumption that no assistance from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or other outside countries will be necessary. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have said for weeks that opposition to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> has been growing but that the dissident elements have been unable to agree on a plan for his ouster. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has imposed a series of economic and diplomatic sanctions against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> over the past two months, and officials have become increasingly frustrated over <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s ability to survive these pressures The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> quoted an unidentified <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration official as saying that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> would be relaxed `` within a week or so.'' The official said the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was considering a list of possible exemptions, including payment of utility bills and `` normal administrative fees and costs'' such as gasoline excise taxes, rental fees and airline landing fees, The Times reported in its Tuesday editions. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is under indictment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug smuggling charges. Some in the administration favor a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military move against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> but several proposals which have been passed on to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> have been given a hostile reception. <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> said that among the seven new cabinet officers appointed on Sunday by <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s successor, President <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>, were several with pro-Cuban leanings. At the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not view the <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> government as legitimate, and she therefore declined comment on the reshuffling. Asked about the shutoff Sunday of electricity to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy annex in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> does not believe embassy operations will be affected. The electricity to the annex and to the apartments of at least 45 embassy workers was cut off because of non-payment of bills. As part of an attempt to deprive Panamanian authorities of cash, the administration has ordered a ban on all payments to the government by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens and organizations.

<HEAD>Ficus Trees Growing Wild In South Florida</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The ficus tree, long considered sterile, now has a way to reproduce on its own, and scientists in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> are bracing for an explosion of the lush, iron-rooted titan of the tropics. The ficus benjamina, or weeping fig, may be a finicky house plant, but it grows very large very fast in hospitable climates. Its dense crown snuff out plants below, and its notorious roots can muscle through pavement to strangle other large trees and choke pipes. Ficus had been held in check by their inability to reproduce _ until now. Tiny insects from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and tropical regions have found their way to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and are allowing the trees to pollinate the wild seeds, which are spread by birds and animals that eat the small berries. A single tree can produce millions of seeds a year. `` You get the idea it's just a rain of these things coming down all the time,'' said <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> <PERSON> McKey </PERSON>, tropical biologist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION>, where ficus have been seen sprouting on stone walls and sidewalk cracks. Until such insects as the female fig wasp came to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, ficus could only be reproduced in plant nurseries from other cuttings. That meant the spread of ficus was limited to where property owners planted them. Most of the wild seedlings spotted so far are small, but the growth has been widespread. They have been seen dotting lawns and forests throughout <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and north to the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area. `` I think we're going to see our landscape change,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a researcher at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>'s subtropical research station in <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION> It's too soon to tell whether they'll be mostly a suburban nuisance or begin to crowd out native vegetation in unspoiled areas, scientists say. `` They might become a pest in our nature preserves and hammocks,'' <PERSON> McKey </PERSON> said recently. `` Otherwise, the habitat is going to be in <LOCATION> suburbia </LOCATION> in our landscapes, where everything else is unnatural.''

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> says his communist government wants better relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and would even consider accepting military aid from a nation now supporting thousands of Afghan rebels. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> also confirmed on Sunday that guerrillas fighting his Soviet-backed government had captured a garrison near the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> border after a four-month siege. The guerrillas said the victory opened a new, direct supply route for weapons into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. In a speech to a visiting Soviet delegation and a group of private American citizens, <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must stop providing military aid to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> if it wants the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to stop arming <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s demand appeared more rhetorical than practical. His army's vulnerability to attacks by Pakistani-based Afghan guerrillas would become even more pronounced if <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> lost <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s backing Expounding on a `` formula of symmetry,'' <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> suggested Soviet aid to his government continue at the same level as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistance to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. If `` there must be a cutoff of aid for the Afghan government, there must be a cutoff of all American aid to the Pakistani government,'' <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> told the two groups at the end of a week-long conference on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has agreed to start withdrawing its estimated 115,000 troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on May 15 under a U.N.-mediated agreement signed April 14 in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and several other countries have been aiding the Afghan guerrillas via <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> arms the Afghan military forces. Each superpower has reseved the right to continue its assistance as long as the other one does. Throughout his address to the American and Soviet delegations, <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> stressed his government's friendship with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which shares a 1,400-mile border with this central <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> nation. But he said repeatedly that his government sought friendlier ties _ and specifically private investment _ from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Talking later with reporters, he said: `` We would like good relations, politically, economically, culturally with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, even including military aid to our country to defend its sovereignty and its territorial integrity.'' Guerrilla leaders in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> said Saturday their fighters captured <PERSON> Barikot </PERSON>, base of the Afghan army's 55th brigade, on Friday. The garrison is in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s northeast <LOCATION> Kunar </LOCATION> province. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> confirmed that government troops evacuated the garrison but described the incident as `` a hange of position'' rather than a defeat. Later Sunday, <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> attended a ceremony marking <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s April 27 communist revolution and reiterated his call for reconciliation with the rebels `` Now more than any other time, we are hopeful for peace and national reconciliation,'' he was quoted as saying by <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kabul </ORGANIZATION>. For the guerrillas, the capture of <LOCATION> Barikot </LOCATION> would open a major weapons supply route from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s border town of <LOCATION> Arando </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s northeastern province of <LOCATION> Nuristan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kunar </LOCATION>. The guerrillas, who were not direct party to the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accord, have vowed to continue fighting until <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s government is overthrown. The Soviets intervened in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979. The Afghan president, whose robust, fleshy build gives him the appearance of a football player gone slightly to seed, flashed broad smiles and gestured expansively as he met the Soviet and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> groups for two hours at Arg Palace in the heart of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. Throughout his speech, <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, who replaced another Soviet-backed Afghan leader in 1986, denounced the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for supplying the guerrillas with high-powered Stinger missiles. The Afghan government repeatedly has accused the rebels of using Stingers against civilian Afghan aircraft. The head of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> delegation, former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, defended the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` It was not the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that introduced high-tech weapons into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> White </PERSON>, who is now president of the non-government <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` Stingers ... are terrible weapons, but their objectives are to destroy machines of war that have rained death and destruction on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> said.

 The visit last week of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Cardinal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> marked the latest in a series of moves indicating greater government acceptance of religion in this communist nation.

One woman, <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON> <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Padron </PERSON>, said her husband, <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON>, had been imprisoned 22 years simply for being a practicing <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>. But when asked if she was afraid to be at the <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>, she said: `` Nervous? No, we are not nervous here. No, that was in the past. It's different now. The hands of the communists are easier _ not so harsh.'' <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> met with <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> on Wednesday night and, according to the cardinal, agreed to grant more visas for foreign nuns to come to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. Last month, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> authorized 19 foreign priests and an expatriate Cuban clergyman to work in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, along with the 210 priests already in the communist nation. Last year, the government allowed importation of 30,000 Bibles. And in 1986, the leadership called on citizens to respect the beliefs of churchgoers. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> now has an office of religious affairs, and <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> has made no secret of the fact that he would welcome a visit by the pope. There apparently is more than one reason for this relaxation. The number of Roman Catholics has decreased to an acceptable level, by government standards. When <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> siezed power in 1959 about 85 percent of Cubans were Roman Catholics. Now Roman Catholics make up an estimated 41 percent of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s 10.2 million people. In addition, the government has realized that it's possible to be loyal both to the church and to the revolution. `` Theoretically it is possible, and in reality it also is,'' Education Minister <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> told reporters while touring <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>'s historical colonial section with <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>. Even <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> told reporters, `` All of us in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would be revolutionaries, I guess. We are the product of a revolution. I've never thought of myself as a bad Catholic for that reason.'' <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s treatment of religion began changing around 1985 after the publication of the book `` Fidel and Religion,'' by the Rev. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Christo </PERSON>, a Brazilian priest. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> told <PERSON> Christo </PERSON> he never opposed the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chuch </ORGANIZATION> as an institution _ only those `` militant Catholics ... from the rich class that supported the counterrevolution.'' He described as `` models for Communists'' the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> nuns who work in Cuban hospitals and mental asylums. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said he drummed the idea of the church's resourcefulness into <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> during their talk, and <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> responded eagerly <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> welcomed the idea of having an American clergyman as a liaison between the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government and Cuban political prisoners in an attempt to get the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to accept the prisoners, the cardinal said. The two also discussed the possibility of church assistance in helping <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> obtain medical supplies unavailable on the island nation. Closer church-state relations and especially a papal visit would boost <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s image abroad. `` The church could be very very helpful in explaining to the world at large what is legitimate in the revolutionary government here in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said. Government officials turned out in force to greet <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, and the cardinal indicated the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> would pay close attention to this in deciding whether <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> should be added to the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>'s future itinerary. The reaction in churches and on the street to <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>'s presence gave credence to the cardinal's comment that the faith in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> is still solid, despite years of restrictions One elderly woman clutching rosary beads rushed up to pastor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>'s secretary, as he walked through the streets of <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> and told him what a wonderful thing the cardinal's visit was. `` No political system, no ideology, is going to be ultimately successful in driving -LRB- the faith -RRB- out,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said. `` Success could be achieved for a period of time, but the seed is there, and it keeps springing back into flower.''

<TEXT>
 A recent series of books and articles and a sharp political debate have bared some of the darkest and most sensitive moments of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s fascist past. The treatment of Jews, the conduct of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the plight of Italian soldiers left to choose sides between the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> and the Allies all have come under scrutiny. Some of the issues are being used as fuel in current political maneuvering, particularly in the struggle between the Communists and the Socialists for dominance of the Italian left. Others have surfaced as <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s Jewish community prepares to mark the 50th anniversary of the racial laws enacted by <PERSON> Benito </PERSON> <PERSON> Mussolini </PERSON>'s fascist dictatorship, which foreshadowed deportations to Nazi death camps. The controversy involving the alleged complicity in war crimes of President <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> in neighboring <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> brought a reminder that Italian as well as Nazi troops were occupying the <LOCATION> Balkans </LOCATION>. The probing has touched some raw nerves. When <PERSON> Renzo </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Felice </PERSON>, a leading historian who wrote a highly respected biography of <PERSON> Mussolini </PERSON>, lectured at <ORGANIZATION> Rome </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, he was heckled and harassed by leftist students. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Felice </PERSON> recently suggested anti-fascism was mainly serving the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and should be abandoned. But other books praise Italians who fought fascism. `` We all looked at ourselves as anti-fascist and on the side of the Allies,'' says <PERSON> Furio </PERSON> <PERSON> Colombo </PERSON>, the president of <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION> and a <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> lecturer who wrote the preface to the Italian edition of American historian <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuccotti </PERSON>'s book `` The Italians and the Holocaust.'' The book, published here in March by <ORGANIZATION> Mondadori </ORGANIZATION>, gives generally high marks to Italians, noting that <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> shares with <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> the merit of the highest percentage of Jews saved. But it also makes the point that Italians bear a share of guilt. More than 8,000 Jews were deported and only about 900 of them survived. `` It should n't be possible any longer to boast of the ` minimum number' of Italian Jews put to death,'' said <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> in his preface. `` Only one Italian Jew persecuted -LRB- and there were thousands -RRB- would already represent a crime serious enough to force a collective rethinking of the past.'' Any confusion about Italians coming to terms with the past can perhaps be attributed in part to the shifting loyalties that evolved as <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> became bogged down in World War II, leaving the country in a `` no man's land'' between winners and losers at the end. <PERSON> Mussolini </PERSON> came to power in 1922, launched an invasion of <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> in 1936 and took <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> into World War II on the side of <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germany </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. He was ousted from power in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> in July 1943 after Allied forces landed in <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION>. In September 1943, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> surrendered unconditionally to the Allies. In the meantime, the Germans helped <PERSON> Mussolini </PERSON> escape from prison and established him in a puppet regime in the north. Italian partisans captured <PERSON> Mussolini </PERSON> and his mistress, <PERSON> Clara </PERSON> <PERSON> Petacci </PERSON>, on April 27, 1945, shot them and hung their bodies upside down at a gasoline station near <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>. One of the bitterest quarrels to emerge has pitted Communist and <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials over whether <PERSON> Palmiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Togliatti </PERSON>, who led the Communists from 1927 until his death in 1964, had abandoned the party's founder, <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramsci </PERSON>, to fascist prison. The allegations center over whether <LOCATION> Togliatti </LOCATION>, from his exile in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, had not tried to press the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to negotiate the freedom of <PERSON> Gramsci </PERSON>, known more as a liberal thinker than the party boss. `` <LOCATION> Togliatti </LOCATION> was neither a saint nor a hero,'' said former Socialist Premier <PERSON> Bettino </PERSON> <PERSON> Craxi </PERSON>, drawing the rage of the Communist leadership. Historian <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Felice </PERSON>'s point is that <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> is ill-served by a continued use of anti-fascism as a political reference point, as if anti-fascist meant democratic. `` I do n't say you have to forget fascism,'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Felice </PERSON> said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` I say that today, that the use of the label anti-fascism has allowed the Communists to present themselves as the other parties. It has given them a common heritage.'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Felice </PERSON> also contends that the postwar laws forbidding re-establishment of the <ORGANIZATION> Fascist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> are anachronistic, since there is a neo-fascist party, the Italian <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, which has consistently gathered around 6 percent of the vote. The historian also told <ORGANIZATION> Milan </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Corriere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> della </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sera </ORGANIZATION> that the `` myth'' of fascism is over, noting that <PERSON> Mussolini </PERSON>'s granddaughter, a budding actress, recently posed topless in an Italian men's magazine Others disagree that it's time to move on. <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, for example, said that while he may agree with <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Felice </PERSON> intellectually `` some signal still has to be given'' about the evils of fascism. The Jewish community of about 40,000 plans major commemorations this fall of the enactment of the racial laws that expelled Jews from government positions and the military and put restrictions on their work, schooling and possession of property. `` It's too soon to say let bygones be bygones,'' said <PERSON> Tullia </PERSON> <PERSON> Zevi </PERSON>, president of the Union of Italian Jewish Communities. Jewish leaders note that until 1938 the Jewish community was fully integrated in Italian society, holding important posts in the military and government and even the Fascist Party. Another a point of controversy is whether <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> <PERSON> Pius </PERSON> <PERSON> XII </PERSON> did all he could to save the Jews. The <PERSON> Zuccotti </PERSON> book praises the efforts of individual priests to protect Italian Jews. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>, which has repeatedly defended the efforts of the pope, on April 13 ran excerpts in its daily newspaper from a new book by a German historian contesting allegations against <PERSON> Pius </PERSON> <PERSON> XII </PERSON>. The newspaper, <PERSON> L'Osservatore </PERSON> <PERSON> Romano </PERSON>, called it a `` vibrant and direct response to the denigrators of the pontiff.''

 <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Nightline'' tonight begins a week of shows live from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, including a three-hour panel discussion in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> before an audience of 700 Israelis and Palestinians. `` Good Lord only knows'' how the live discussion will turn out, said `` Nightline'' anchor <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Koppel </PERSON>, who has done shows in previous years from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. `` This just seemed like one of those subjects that is so rich and meaty it really ca n't be covered in an hour or two over here, so we're going to spend a week over there,'' said <PERSON> Koppel </PERSON> before leaving for <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> from which most of the shows will be broadcast. Monday night's one-hour broadcast will feature an interview with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>, as well as other guests not yet lined up as of this weekend. Likewise, guests for the `` town hall meeting'' on Tuesday had not been determined. <PERSON> Koppel </PERSON> said participants would include Israelis and Palestinians, though selection of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> representatives was difficult because Israeli government officials will not participate if there's anyone sympathetic to the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> involved. The trip was planned last year, <PERSON> Koppel </PERSON> said, before the recent violence on the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> prompted new interest in the conflict between <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> and Israelis. `` What we're trying to do is make it clearer to an American audience what the different positions are and also make it clear what you're dealing with is not a homogenous Israeli point of view or for that matter a homogenous Palestinian point of view. There are shadings,'' said <PERSON> Koppel </PERSON>. `` Part of what we're going to try to do out there, and I'd say probably the most important thing we going to try to do is provide a context that critics of television, I think quite correctly, have suggested we have not been providing over the past couple of years.'' The rest of the week's schedule was not set, though <PERSON> Koppel </PERSON> said he hoped to interview King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>. That show would originate from <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. As far going to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> itself, <PERSON> Koppel </PERSON> said, `` I'm sure I'll be taking a few field trips.'' <PERSON> Koppel </PERSON> said officials in the region had been cooperative so far, but he added: `` I've spent too much time in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> to take anything for granted. I'll find out when I get on the air.''

Before he left, in <LOCATION> Tblisi </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION>, he delivered an overt message on religious freedom, attending the Georgian Orthodox Cathedral here Sunday and <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sophia </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> on Saturday. Even at a lavish lunch here with dozens of writers, singers and artists, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> went out of his way in a toast to say: `` I could feel, in a sense, I was in the presence of the Creator.'' In <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> also visited <PERSON> Babi </PERSON> <PERSON> Yar </PERSON>, the Nazi killing ground in World War II, where tens of thousands of Jews and other Ukrainians were slaughtered. `` We have to say to ourselves always, never again,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> vowed. In <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sophia </LOCATION>'s, a cathedral that <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> authorities have converted into a museum, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said the majestic building `` just shows you the commitment of and power of religion.'' In an evolving human rights policy, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> has kept up <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pressure on the Soviets to expand Jewish emigration while pressing for more freedom of religious practices for all citizens. <LOCATION> Tblisi </LOCATION>, a relatively relaxed city far from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, has functioning churches and even two jewish synagogues. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, addressing the patriarch, <PERSON> Iliya </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, and the congregants who jammed the small cathedral, said he understood their desire for `` progress in belief, in religion.'' `` ` You must be meaning progress in the spread and acceptance of faith because it has an immense continuity,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said, `` It could n't be more evident them being here in this church.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> reported little progress in the talks, which focused on a treaty that would halve <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet arsenals of strategic nuclear weapons. The goal had been to complete the treaty by May 29 when President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> journeys to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for a summit meeting with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. But officials have expressed doubt the pact will be ready by then because too many disagreements remain.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s spokesman suggests that there is `` something really unseemly'' about efforts to promote this or that person as the ideal vice presidential candidate. Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is even more blunt. `` The nominee makes that decision,'' he says. But the people who are promoting various running mates as the only real hope for the Republican or Democratic ticket in the fall are not easily discouraged. To begin with, they tend to be people who thought neither <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had a chance of surviving the primary season. Depending on their place on the political spectrum, they spent much of the past year dreaming that <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> or <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> or <PERSON> Jeane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON> would bring some excitement to the presidential race. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was saddled with the `` wimp factor,'' with Iran-Contra and his unwillingness to talk about where he differed with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. He was giving new definition to the phrase `` loyal to a fault.'' And <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>? Was the country ready to turn from <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to the governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, the state that is a national symbol of liberalism? And talk about dull _ <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> often seemed to put himself asleep. Despite the skeptics, here they are _ as close to a sure thing as you get in American politics. The <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> primary on Tuesday should give <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the 1,139 delegates he needs to claim a majority at the Republican National Convention next August in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. That same primary should give <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> a fourth straight primary victory and convince most of the remaining doubters that the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor will be the candidate chosen in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> in July to recapture the White House for the Democrats. But the skeptics still doubt either man can win in November without considerable help from a carefully chosen running mate. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has a perceived problem of geography. Not since 1976, when Georgian <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> was at the top of the ticket, has a Democratic presidential candidate carried the South. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> carried 10 of 11 Southern states in 1976, but four years later lost 10 of 11 states in the region to <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. This year, conventional wisdom is the Democrats need to carry the South. Southern legislators came up with the dubious idea of a Southern regional primary as the way to ensure that the party would pick somebody acceptable to the South. But the big winners on Super Tuesday were <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, the favorite of the white Southern establishment, also did well but never could win a major state outside the region. To bolster his Southern strength, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is being urged to choose from a small group of <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> senators _ <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> or <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> is viewed as the party's most impressive spokesman on national security issues, an area where <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is seen as potentially vulnerable. But on domestic policy <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> is a Reagan Democrat. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> have more basic credentials _ each comes from a state that is high on the Democrats' short list of those their nominee must carry in November. Neither <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> nor his party has to worry as much about geography. After all, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is from practically everywhere _ claiming ties with <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, where he was born; <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, where he grew up; <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where he now has a home; and <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> where he has a home and a burial plot. In obvious contrast to the Democrats, the Republicans have been looking unbeatable in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> in recent presidential elections. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> makes a lot of Republicans nervous. Some think he's a weak candidate; others find him ideologically suspect. The party's conservative wing wants a signal from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that he is a loyal conservative who wo n't ditch the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> agenda if he becomes president. What they now view as the clearest signal would be the choice of one of their own as his running mate. Few people set conservative hearts aflutter like <PERSON> Jeane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON>, the hardline former <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador. So now comes <PERSON> Curt </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinkscales </PERSON>, a conservative activist, who has formed an unauthorized committee to draft Mrs. <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON> for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> ticket _ an effort the former ambassador disavowed through a spokesman. `` She believes the decision on the vice president should be solely that of Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Salter </PERSON>. Nor was it encouraged by <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON>, spokesman for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` These efforts are sometimes embarrassing to the people that they're allegedly designed to help,'' he said. `` There's just something really unseemly about trying to force somebody onto a ticket ... to throw them forward in an effort they have n't sanctioned themselves. About the only politician who regularly campaigns for the vice presidential nomination is <PERSON> Endicott </PERSON> <PERSON> Peabody </PERSON>, the former governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> who now resides in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. However, Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, who was a conservative favorite in the early stages of this year's presidential campaign, now is coming as closed to <LOCATION> Peabody </LOCATION> as he can get. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> denies he's running for the vice presidency, but makes no secret that he'd love to have the job. `` Anybody in the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> would have to look upon the vice presidency with interest,'' he said. `` But _ and it was a very large but _ I said I do n't expect it.''

<TEXT>
 Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is facing serious obstacles in his effort to overhaul the troubled, inefficient Soviet economy and things are n't likely to improve anytime soon, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence agencies. `` <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s ambitious program to create a modern, more dynamic Soviet economy ran into trouble in 1987,'' says a joint study by the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. `` The short-term outlook for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s economic program is not good,'' concluded the study, which was released Sunday by the congressional <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` The real loser in 1987 appeared to be the consumer, who _ now three years into <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s economic program _ has seen almost no increase in his standard of living,'' the study said. The main problems last year were poor weather and resistance to change in the huge, slow-moving Soviet bureaucracy, said the report. As a result, the Soviet gross national product grew only 0.5 percent last year, compared with a 3.9 percent increase in 1986, which was the first full year of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s term. The gross national product is the total value of all goods and services produced and is a key measure of an economy. By contrast, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> GNP grew by 2.9 percent in both 1986 and 1987, but the American economy is much larger and exact comparisons are difficult to make. Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, D-Wis., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the study shows `` the Soviet economy did not pause last year, it stumbled This does not mean that the reform program is necessarily doomed or that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will be ousted.'' `` It is still too soon to pass judgment on the reforms or on <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s leadership,'' <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> said. The study predicted that unless <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> can turn things around, he faces trouble. `` Tension within society and the leadership will increase,'' it said. `` Bureaucrats will become increasingly frustrated by loss of privileges and status and by demands that they show greater initiative. Military leaders are likely to become more and more uneasy if benefits from the industrial modernization fail to materialize. `` Soviet citizens will need to see some improvement in living standards if the regime is to achieve necessary gains in worker productivity and avoid widespread discontent,'' the study said. `` Failure to head off these tensions would, at a minimum, make it more difficult to pursue his economic program vigorously and could ultimately call into question his strong political position at home,'' the study said. The study was presented April 13. The <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> released a declassified version. When <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> took over in March 1985, the study noted, he inherited an aging, backward, extremely inefficient economy. He made reform a top priority. Last year's problems were caused by a combination of factors, the study said. `` Familiar problems with poor weather and transportation bottlenecks were compounded by the disruptions caused by the introduction of economic reforms,'' it said. Agricultural output fell because of bad weather. Industrial quality control measures also `` proved to be particularly disruptive, especially early in the year.'' Thus, industry only grew 1.5 percent and the civilian machine-building sector did n't grow at all

 Gov. <PERSON> Arch </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> is finding that perhaps his toughest opponent in his re-election bid is the image he helped create for himself. The almost mythical <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> benefited from an influx of federal funds and a healthy economy as he opened highways, constructed buildings and created jobs during his first two terms from 1969 to 1977. But he has been criticized during his third term as skippering a rudderless ship awash in financial problems that the captain can not or will not control. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, 65, faces his first serious political challenge in May 10's <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primary in which he is seeking an unprecedented fourth term. His opponent, <LOCATION> Morgantown </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Raese </PERSON>, is an aggressive campaigner who has capitalized on the state's woes. `` Everybody changes as they mature,'' former state <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Strange </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>. `` I think the real changes are the circumstances and conditions in which he's operating. `` Number one, he does n't have the money that was available either through federal funding or the state's economy. And secondly, he does n't have the team of department heads and advisers he had in the first eight years.'' <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s administrative abilities have drawn the most fire. Even administration officials concede that when <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> was returned to office in 1984, people expected a miracle turnaround that <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> has been unable to produce. The governor can point to a record of hard work, a gradual reduction in the unemployment rate and increased industrial development, but the days of major announcements have ended. A spokesman for the state <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, for instance, says the state has lost 36 major plants between 1979 and 1986, idling 4,450 workers, and said 28,000 manufacturing jobs were lost in the plants that remain open. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s first two terms were marked by a burgeoning economy. Federal money poured into the state, and <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> took the credit. He seemed to be everywhere at once, opening 225 miles of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s 515 miles of interstate highway, overseeing construction of the state Science and Cultural Center on the Capitol grounds, and luring new businesses. The myth of the all-knowing, all-seeing leader is one that he helped cultivate in a state where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans 2-1. Even a 1976 federal extortion indictment did not slow him. On the day he was indicted, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> called a news conference to announce he would seek a third consecutive term, although the state constitution appeared to prohibit it. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> was acquitted, but the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> barred his re-election bid. He left what he said was a $ 234 million budget surplus, a booming interstate highway building program and reasonably strong coal, steel and glass industries. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> opened a law practice and ran unsuccessfully for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1978 and governor in 1980. When <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> again entered the governor's office for an unprecedented third term in 1985, he found the state in much different shape. The unemployment rate hit 18 percent the year before as the state's economy hit rock-bottom. The state faced a $ 250 million debt in the unemployment compensation fund that had been run up by Democratic Gov. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON>. The Legislature had enacted huge tax increases. And federal funding for highway construction and other projects dwindled. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> asked the Legislature for a myriad of economic tools to attract business, and later claimed success. He says he has attracted more than $ 1 billion in development money during each of the past two years, and that the unemployment rate dropped below 11 percent in 1987. Critics, however, scoffed at his economic announcements, saying thousands have fled seeking jobs elsewhere. A <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> study found the state lost 52,600 of its 1.9 million residents since 1980. Raese, a newspaper publisher and coal and limestone company owner, calls himself a conservative, pro-business candidate. He says <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> has failed to adjust spending to the state's dwindling tax income. `` Arch <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> is just a credit card governor,'' <PERSON> Raese </PERSON> said during a recent interview. `` He's marching to an old liberal tune of the late 1950s and early 1960s.'' According to a poll released today, <PERSON> Raese </PERSON> holds a substantial lead over <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> among Republicans and independents, 54 percent to 30 percent. Sixty-nine percent of the Republicans surveyed rated <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s performance as governor as poor or fair. The poll, conducted by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Charleston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mail </ORGANIZATION> and WSAZ-TV, had a margin of error of 4.4 percentage points.

<HEAD>Acid Rain Threatens Northeast Coastal Waters</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Scientists have concluded that acid rain is one of the main pollutants threatening marine life in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> coastal waters, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday. Up to now, most experts have assumed that agricultural runoff and sewage were the major culprits responsible for the increasing number of mass killings of marine life along the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> coast </LOCATION>, the newspaper said. But a new report prepared by scientists of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, a nonprofit environmental group, shows for the first time that acid rain is also contributing to the problem, according to the newspaper. Acid rain comes from nitrogen oxides in emissions from automobiles, power plants and other industries. The oxides are converted into nitric acids and nitrates in the atmosphere. Nitrate salts and other nutrients encourage the growth of algae, which in turn use up oxygen needed by other plants and animals living in the coastal waters, according to the report. `` It is choking off the ocean's nurseries,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Oppenheimer </PERSON>, an atmospheric physicist for the environmental group and a co-author of the report. `` It is shutting down the playground for millions of Americans.' `` It is a regionwide problem, and it is only going to get worse because of the projected growth of nitrogen emissions,'' he added. The study focuses on <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> and its tributaries and found that atmospheric sources account for 25 percent of the nitrogen pouring into the bay each year. Fertilizers account for 34 percent, sewage and other industrial discharges 23 percent, and animal wastes, including runoff from land and evaporated ammonium from manure that travels through the atmosphere, 18 percent. If current trends continue, atmospheric nitrates will constitute 42 percent of annual nitrogen deposits into the bay by the year 2030, according to the report. The conclusion of the report was endorsed by other scientists who have read drafts of it, including <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, an ecologist with the <ORGANIZATION> Waste </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Stony </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brook </LOCATION>, according to the Times. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Hidy </PERSON>, director of the environment division of the <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> _ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> a </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> utility </ORGANIZATION> companies that emit large amounts of sulfur and nitrogen from their plants _ called the report's findings `` an interesting and surprising hypothesis that needs to be verified.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiese </PERSON> has seen the Vietnam War twice: first-hand as a gunner on a helicopter, and through fleeting images captured by soldiers on 8mm home movie film. <PERSON> Wiese </PERSON>, 38, estimates he has collected 1,000 hours of amateur footage during the last decade. Some of it is entertaining and some is boring but little is gory. All of it helps neutralize the nightmare of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Wiese </PERSON> says. He has pieced together some of his best footage in a 90-minute videocassette being test marketed in the <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> area. The tape, `` Helicopter Gunship Assault,'' is the first of what <PERSON> Wiese </PERSON> hopes will be a series of at least six tapes. `` In 90 percent of the film, it's unknown to me who took it or where it was taken,'' he said. `` But still, everybody wanted to watch it because what a soldier would take a picture of over there just to show mom was not what they were showing on the news.'' To <PERSON> Wiese </PERSON>, who spent seven months behind a machine gun aboard an Army helicopter, the film `` is the best therapy I ever had. It's like reliving a nightmare If you relive it long enough, it's not a nightmare anymore. I've watched this 300 times, and I'm never bored. `` ` Nam was such a hard story for everybody to tell people back home about,'' he said. `` This makes the memories bubble out of you.'' Some footage shows soldiers escaping the war on a muggy day by landing their helicopters on a riverbank and taking a swim. Another scene shows helicopters dropping down to rescue patrols under attack. There are scenes of helicopter gunships firing at ground targets and receiving return fire. Most of the footage is remarkably intact after 20 years; little of the color has faded. One pilot shows the hut he made from scrap wood and discarded rocket boxes after his tent rotted through. Another narrates as a dog yaps in the background. `` If you watch over to the left, you'll see the tracers coming up at us,'' he says. `` There they are.'' <PERSON> Wiese </PERSON> says he has come across few gory scenes. `` I have some helicopter accidents,'' he says. `` I got aftermath of an ambush. But actual combat footage, I do n't have much,'' he said. `` Soldiers were paid to keep their heads down.'' <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> was the first war in which soldiers could carry a lightweight camera with automatic shutter control and focusing capability. Still, <PERSON> Wiese </PERSON> says very little 8mm footage was shot in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. His first three reels were purchased for $ 1 each at a flea market. `` They were very boring,'' he said. `` I wanted at one time to collect photographs _ I lost my own collection,'' he said. `` And everyone has photos. But the 8mm stuff is real rare.'' So he started placing ads in local papers and national publications asking veterans to send him their film. He then transferred the film to VHS tape, returning one tape and the original film to the owner, and keeping a copy for himself. When possible, he got the soldiers to send an audio cassette narrative. <PERSON> Wiese </PERSON>, who formed a company called `` <ORGANIZATION> Vietnam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION>,'' has the owner sign an agreement giving him rights to the film. `` I promise to give them a royalty on each cassette,'' he said. He hopes to place his videos in libraries. `` I'm no <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Wiese </PERSON>. `` My intention is a real simple one: to collect this film and save it. I think some of it is worth being preserved. `` And it's great to get a bunch of guys together and sit down and watch this. You just ca n't believe the lies these guy will tell from their war stories.''

<TEXT>
 A young man was shot to death Sunday in a gang-related scuffle as he stood in line for the movie `` Colors,'' police said. A 17-year-old was suffered minor injuries outside the Regency Cinema when the bullet passed through the 19-year-old's head and hit her, said Lt. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wim </PERSON>. `` Colors,'' which stars <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvall </PERSON> and opened nationwide April 15, portrays the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Crips </LOCATION> and Bloods gangs. It opened amid fears it would inspire more bloodshed, but until Sunday little violence materialized. The assailant, a man in his 20s, wore a red handkerchief denoting membership in the Bloods; the victim wore the blue handkerchief of the Crips, <PERSON> Swain </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Swain </PERSON> the gunman had gotten out of a car and approached the 19-year-old, asking, `` Are you a ricket?'' Swim said the word is a derogatory term for the <LOCATION> Crips </LOCATION>. The victim's girlfriend stepped between the two, a scuffle broke out involving two of the gunman's companions and the victim's brother-in-law, and the victim was shot in the head as he started to run, police said Police and sheriff's deputies have kept up a presence at theaters in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and other places with gang problems during the screening of the movie, and some theaters across the nation have declined to show the film. Minor scuffles at an opening in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> led to 13 arrests.

<HEAD>Dropping Water Table Means Long-term Changes in Plains</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 It was part of what explorer <LOCATION> Zebulon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pike </LOCATION> in 1806 called the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> High </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> where grass was the natural crop and buffaloes roamed far and wide. <PERSON> Pike </PERSON>'s adventures along the <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> gave rise to a notion at the time that the huge region of low rainfall, short grass and few natural water holes was a natural barrier that would limit <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> westward expansion. Farmers tried to tame it with the plow, but often drought and crop failure dominated the huge region, generally west of the 100th meridian. Dryland farming, the settlers found, was a precarious business in the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION>. It began to change after enterprising farmers tapped underground water supplies for large-scale irrigation. A huge, invisible lake _ the <LOCATION> Ogallala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aquifer </LOCATION> _ was a gold mine for parts of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>. But for years the underground water level has been receding, forcing deeper drilling and greater pumping costs. Already irrigation has become uneconomical for many. `` In order to maintain a viable agricultural economy, this area must return to a dryland type of production,'' says <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> economist <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> in the current issue of <LOCATION> Farmline </LOCATION> magazine. `` How soon the transition will be made depends somewhat on how willing farmers are to change their irrigation practices.'' <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> said `` it seems reasonable to assume'' that some irrigation will continue for a number of years. New technologies and more drought-tolerant plants may help for a time. `` Whatever the time, though, adjustments must be made in order to be ready when the wells run dry,'' he said. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> and a colleague, <PERSON> Mindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrulis </PERSON>, in the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> studied an area of the high plains in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, which included seven irrigated counties and eight neighboring dryland counties The irrigated counties included <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Crosby </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hale </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Lamb </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Parmer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Swisher </PERSON>, while the dryland counties were <ORGANIZATION> Baylor </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Cottle </PERSON>, <PERSON> Foard </PERSON>, <PERSON> Haskell </PERSON>, King, <PERSON> Knox </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stonewall </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Throckmorton </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> said the irrigated counties enjoyed an economic boom in the 1940s and 1950s as irrigation became widespread. A move to `` center pivot'' systems made it possible to nearly triple yields of cotton, wheat and corn on land previously farmed without irrigation. By 1960, the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> high plains had become one of the most irrigation-dependent areas of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But the nearby dryland counties, which lie just to the east of the <LOCATION> Ogallala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aquifer </LOCATION>, have never had enough water from surface or below-ground sources to develop agriculture based on irrigation. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> said that has been apparent from their economic performance beginning in the 1940s. `` The economy of the dryland farming area continued to stagnate and periodically worsen, because of the lack of water for crops,'' <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> said. `` One effect has been a continued heavy outmigration of rural people.'' For example, between 1940 and 1984, the total population of the dryland counties was cut in half and employment was reduced by a fourth. In contrast, <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> said, the irrigated counties experienced rapid economic growth and development during most of the 1940-84 period. Despite a small decline in the last few decades, total population in the mid-1980s exceeded 100,000 people, a 38 percent increase from 1940, and employment at about 41,000 was up nearly 80 percent. Meanwhile, in the dryland counties that were n't blessed with an abundance of water, farms grew larger and fewer in order to maintain their incomes, and population dropped by 32 percent from 1940 to 1959. `` Dryland farming does not require a large labor force, nor can it support a large rural or urban population,'' <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> said. `` Thus, there was little inducement for people to move into the area or, having been born there, to stay. More and more people found employment elsewhere.'' But by 1960, the fast-track development of the irrigated counties slowed down. From 1959 to 1978, he said, the value of farm products sold increased about 60 percent, compared with a tenfold increase in the previous 19 years. And by 1978, almost 2,400 irrigation farmers had gone out of business and 140,000 acres of cropland had been taken out of irrigation. Rising costs of energy took a toll. The tough times continued among dryland farmers, too. Population in those counties dropped by more than a fourth from 1959 to 1978, total employment was down more than a tenth, and 31 percent of the farm operators went out of business, <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> said. In the 1980s, the financial situation for farmers across the nation deepened as debt piled up, land values declined and interest rates edged higher. Between 1978 and 1984, the total value of farm products sold dropped 4 percent in the irrigated counties, while they increased about 10 percent in the dryland area. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> said the population of the irrigated counties in 1978-84 declined about 3 percent, and total employment decreased for the first time since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The trends were much different in the dryland counties. Farm income rose 22 percent, compared with an 18 percent decline in the irrigated counties. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> said that was because the proportion of total farm sales from wheat in the dryland areas tripled from 1978 to 1984 because of government price support programs. And dryland farm operations cost much less. In fact, he said, per capita income in the dryland counties in 1984 was higher than it had ever been in the irrigated counties. Unfortunately, the long decades of decline in the dryland counties had resulted in a grim bottoming out. `` So many people have left that the economy has finally stabilized, and most of those who remain are those with the jobs that are still available,'' <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Star Wars, MX, Midgetman Up for House Consideration</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> will revisit familiar battlegrounds this week when it takes up a massive <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget bill and tries to decide how much to spend on Star Wars and nuclear missiles such as the Midgetman and MX. `` We do n't seem to be able to decide anything once and for all,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, D-Wis., as he looked forward to the annual debate over how much money to authorize for the largest single agency of the federal government It will take at least two weeks for the Democratic-controlled chamber to plow through the huge bill and the 240 amendments which already have been proposed. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget sparks long debate each year, <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> noted, because <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules require that amendments be germane to the subject of the bill at hand. That tends to limit debate on other measures, but <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> said, `` Anyone who wants to offer an amendment on just about anything can find something in the defense bill that it is germane to.'' The bill authorizes the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to spend $ 299 billion in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, an amount that was set five months ago. White House and congressional leaders agreed on the overall figure in December as part of a package designed to reduce federal deficits. The agreement on the overall budget `` left us free to concentrate on smaller issues,'' <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> noted. It also speeded up the process of writing the bill, which normally does n't go to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor until June or later. The $ 299 billion is $ 33 billion less than the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> had expected to have, and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> has ordered reductions in a number of programs to meet that goal. While the total budget is less than the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> wanted, the huge bill includes money to buy another Trident missile-firing submarine, two more attack submarines, the first of a new class of Seawolf subs, 180 F-16 jets, 42 F-15s, 72 Apache attack helicopters, 611 M-1 tanks, 550 Bradley Fighting Vehicles, and three <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> destroyers. The measure which passes the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> will eventually have to be reconciled with the bill the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approves. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has just begun the process of writing its defense bill, meaning the measure is n't likely to reach the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor until mid-year or later. As in past years, one of the major battles will be over the budget for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Star Wars program, known formally as the Strategic Defense Initiative. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> sought $ 4.8 billion for the program, which is receiving $ 3.9 billion this year. But <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>'s committee cut the figure to $ 4.0 billion, barely above the current budget and $ 600 million less than the amount set last week by a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee. `` I expect we'll have moves on the Star Wars budget from both the right and left,'' said <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, explaining that conservatives will try to increase the SDI budget while liberals will seek to cut it. During the committee consideration of the bill, there were four amendments to set the SDI budget and at least that many are likely to be offered on the floor. Another contentious issue is the Midgetman versus MX fight. Both the nuclear weapons are land-based missiles and are designed to replace the aging Minuteman as part of the nation's atomic deterrence force. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> originally wanted 100 of the 10-warhead MX weapons, but <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approved only 50 for basing in western silos and said the Pentagon should develop the single-warhead, mobile Midgetman because it would be easier to hide from Soviet attack. Now, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> is proposing to build 50 more MX weapons and put them aboard trains to make it tougher for the Soviets to find the missiles. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> sought $ 840 million for the railroad version of the MX and $ 200 million for research into Midgetman. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said the latter amount was included only to meet a congressional request to keep the program alive until <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s successor can make a decision on its future. But <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>'s committee gave $ 500 million each to Midgetman and MX and `` you'll see a number of amendments to re-divide that pie on the floor,'' he said. `` I do n't know where we'll come out eventually on that one.'' The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> will also consider a variety of arms control restrictions, similar to those which were added on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor last year. One would require continued <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> adherence to the unratified SALT II nuclear arms treaty, a pact that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> says he will no longer follow. Another would block all but the smallest tests of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear weapons, while a third would continue a 3-year-old moratorium set by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on testing of anti-satellite weapons. The administration opposes all three measures.

<HEAD>Slow Trains Slowing Senate Business</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Members of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> have been trying to put their legislative affairs on a faster track but have been stymied by a problem some of their constituents have long faced _ slow trains. In the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s case, the problem is a 30-year-old subway system that links two of the three <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> office buildings to the Capitol. The senators complain the subway trains just do n't move often enough and fast enough to get them to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> chambers for roll-call votes. Now, a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee has asked the Capitol architect to come up with a full report on the costs of modernizing the subway system. An early estimate of the price tag: $ 10 million. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> made its first stab at making legislating a more orderly affair in February, when it put itself on a new work schedule. One of the changes was to limit roll-call votes _ which sometimes took an hour or more while the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> waited for an absent member to arrive _ to a strict 15 minutes each, no exceptions. Shortly after the new rules were enacted, several members complained that they had arrived at the station at the <ORGANIZATION> Hart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Building </ORGANIZATION> _ some four blocks from the Capitol _ with a minute or two to spare to make a roll call, but the subway car was jammed with visitors. They had to wait for the car to return _ a round trip takes about five minutes _ and they missed the vote. Half of the 100 senators have offices in the <LOCATION> Hart </LOCATION> building. After complaints were made, new rules were issued for the subway: No one but senators can ride during roll-call votes. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> also called on Capitol Architect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> to study the subway system and seek a long-term solution to the problems facing senators coming from the Dirksen and <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> office buildings. The <ORGANIZATION> Russell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Building </ORGANIZATION> has its own line with two sets of tracks. White recommended to the committee last week that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> replace the current two-train shuttle system with a new system of four small trains following one another at one-minute intervals over what he described as a `` pinched loop.'' The vehicles would stop at each station in <LOCATION> Dirksen </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>. The current system has one car on the track to <ORGANIZATION> Dirksen </ORGANIZATION> and one on the track to <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, returning on the same line. White said the new system could be completed in about 30 months and would provide `` a greatly improved, frequent, fast and convenient service to and from the Capitol.'' White rejected another proposal for a moving sidewalk which he said would not be fast enough to handle the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s needs. After White estimated the cost of the new subway at $ 10 million, Sen. <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Garn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION> asked: `` Now what do you estimate the real cost to be?'' White replied that his estimate was conservative. Chairman <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, D-Ky., then asked White if he thought the cost would be more than $ 10 million White replied that he thought it would be less. <PERSON> Garn </PERSON> was n't convinced. `` Having been here 14 years, I have yet to see anything that did n't cost more than we originally estimated,'' he said.

<HEAD>Administration Softening Position on Fair Housing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is softening its opposition to Democrat-sponsored fair housing legislation but still opposes provisions it says would deny the right to trial by jury and be unfair to elderly people, according to a Housing and Urban Development official. Another administration objection _ that a new ban of discrimination against the handicapped could force landlords to accept drug addicts or alcoholics _ was addressed in two amendments passed last week. The bill, expected to be voted on Tuesday in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, would toughen enforcement of the Fair Housing Act of 1968 and expand it to ban discrimination against handicapped people and families with children in rental or sale of living space. A similar bill has been introduced in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The administration had introduced its own fair housing legislation and favors an expansion of the act which now bans discrimination on the bases of sex, ethnic origin or religion. But it is wary of the version now being discussed in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, believing it may be unconstitutional and unfair to some landlords, tenants and home buyers, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> general counsel <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON> said in an interview Friday. The committee last week rejected changes that would have met some administration objections, but it tentatively approved one excluding abusers of controlled substances from being classified as handicapped. Another amendment would allow landlords or sellers to reject people `` whose tenancy would constitute a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals.'' <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON> said there is broad agreement that discrimination against the handicapped should be added to the law. But he had said in a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> last week that the Democratic version `` does not clearly allow those who provide housing to exclude individuals with current impairments, such as current drug abuse, that pose a threat to property or safety of others.'' Major objections to the bill have come from the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> which opposes the setting up of an administrative law judge system to handle discrimination cases, rather than having them go to a regular jury. <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON> said that despite strong objections to parts of the proposed bill, the administration is taking a softer stand than it has in the past. But he said it has not altered its major objections to the Democratic proposals. `` We are not saying anything about a veto at this point at all,'' he said. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has submitted four bills to amend fair housing laws _ in 1983, 1985, 1986 and this year. <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON> said the current Democratic bill is `` not the one that we would prefer.'' But he indicated the administration wants fair housing laws expanded before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> leaves office. <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON> said the administration supports the idea that discrimination cases can be brought for single incidents rather than requiring that a pattern of discrimination be proven, which is required under the 1968 law. But he said the administrative law judge plan does not pass `` constitutional muster.'' <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON> noted that the provision banning discrimination on the basis of `` familial status'' is designed to protect families with children. But he said in the letter, `` This provision intended to ensure fairness may well have substantial unfair effects'' on older Americans and people without children. The bill allows retirement communities or buildings where all the tenants are over 62 to ban children, but singles communities that also have younger people in them would have to accept families with children. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Neas </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, which endorses the Democratic bill, said that despite administration opposition, he expects bipartisan support for the final measure. `` This administration, led by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>, has compiled the worst civil rights record of any administration in half a century,'' <PERSON> Neas </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. But he said the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has failed in all previous efforts to limit civil rights and `` we believe once again a strong bipartisan consensus will reject this one.''

 Organizers expect tens of thousands of Christians to gather in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Friday for a rally and prayers for the future of the nation and the scandal-plagued evangelical movement. The <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> rally, which will be held on the grassy Mall, will lead into a seven-day, around-the-clock prayer vigil called National Praise and Prayer Week that will end at 6 p.m. on May 5. `` We're gathering to ask God to heal our country and heal our church,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gimenez </PERSON>, pastor of <ORGANIZATION> Rock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, and chairman of the rally's national steering committee. The rally's aim, <PERSON> Gimenez </PERSON> said, is to show repentance `` because the church has gotten away from the statutes of holiness,'' to reconcile differences among Christians and to restore the church to leadership. `` We as Christian leaders have a responsibility to our country,'' <PERSON> Gimenez </PERSON> said. `` But we've been ineffective lately because we've had trouble within our own ranks. We need to get back.'' <PERSON> Gimenez </PERSON> said he decided to organize the rally before the sex-and-money scandals brought down three of the best-known television evangelists _ <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>. But, he said, he believes the rally will help the Christian cause as well as help the country. `` I heard the voice of the Lord speak to me and say we should have a gathering,'' he said. <PERSON> Gimenez </PERSON> says he got a similar message from God nearly a decade ago, leading to the first prayer meeting on the Mall in 1980, which attracted an estimated 200,000 people. `` We went to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to pray at that time because our country was in trouble,'' <PERSON> Gimenez </PERSON> recalled. `` We felt we should gather to ask forgiveness and to bring healing because our economy was in bad shape, our citizens were being held prisoner in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. `` And lo and behold, our economy improved and our citizens were released.'' This time, he said, `` we're finding many of the same problems _ the Iranians, our economy is getting shakier, we have a drug epidemic.'' Although the rally is dedicated to reviving old-fashioned Christian values, it will rely on the latest in technology to get the message across. Nine huge screens, similar to those in baseball parks, will line both sides of the Mall and stand behind the stage. The screens will display the activities on stage and videotapes of people the audience will be praying for. The stage, according to a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> press release, is capable of seating a 1,500-voice choir, a 100-piece orchestra a hundreds of dignitaries and Christian leaders. <PERSON> Gimenez </PERSON> estimated the cost of organizing the rally at $ 1.3 million. Among the scheduled speakers are singer <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON>, TV minister <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> radio show host <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gimenez </PERSON> said the rally will not have any political overtones. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> was a speaker at the 1980 rally but is n't on the schedule this time because he is running for the Republican nomination for president, <PERSON> Gimenez </PERSON> said. And, he added, while the rally is pro-Christian, it is not against other religions. `` This is a <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> rally,'' he said. `` We are not in opposition to other religious groups. This is a free country. They can have rallies, too.'' One major difference between the coming rally and the 1980 gathering is in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>' attitude. Eight years ago, the council joined more than a dozen other religious organizations in issuing a statement accusing <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> organizers of trying to `` Christianize the government.'' This year, according to the Rev. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>, the council's executive director, rally sponsors `` sought our assistance from the beginning and they assured us that this will not just be a big splash and then they'll leave town `` They have agreed to help us develop drug treatment centers that will be operated by local churches and they've agreed to help develop and support a Christian network office that will promote fellowship among Christians and meet human needs, like those of the homeless,'' <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> said. `` We've also been assured that this will not be a political forum for a political candidate.'' The rally will begin at 6 a.m. on Friday and last until 6 p.m.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Jehovah </ORGANIZATION>'s Witnesses congregation met in the church built in two days by about 650 people. Volunteers and congregation members from across <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> began work Friday on the 4,600-square-foot Kingdom Hall in Grand Haven Township. It was near completion Sunday afternoon, said <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Newell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Olive </LOCATION>, a member of the congregation's building committee. `` We had our first meeting at 2 o'clock, and we're just finishing up the landscaping work, spreading a little bark around,'' <PERSON> Newell </PERSON> said. `` Everything came off beautiful. The -LRB- township -RRB- inspectors were very impressed with the project and excited to be part of it.'' About a third of the 650 <ORGANIZATION> Jehovah </ORGANIZATION>'s Witnesses who worked on the project were skilled tradesmen who performed carpentry, plumbing and electrical work, he said. Site and foundation work was done ahead of time. The new Kingdom Hall will seat 237 people, and cost the congregation $ 170,000 to build.

<TEXT>
 Over $ 3 billion worth of loans planned by intergovernment banks to raise the standard of living in 20 countries are also likely to damage natural resources and the environment, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government says. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is the biggest contributor to the banks, which are a major source of aid to poor countries. By law, a list of loans considered dangerous by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> will be distributed to other donors such as <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the leading countries of western <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> obtained an advance copy. AID is particularly concerned about projects that dam up big rivers in the tropics, that build roads into undeveloped parts of the world and that try to develop rural areas. One of the biggest loans on the list would provide $ 420 million from the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> for a dam on the <LOCATION> Narmada </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, second only to the <LOCATION> Ganges </LOCATION> in sacredness to Hindus. It will displace 120,000 people, irrigate about 720,000 acres of land and generate 1,000 megawatts of electricity. The agency says the project could also increase the risk of earthquakes, of waterlogging the soil and of transmitting water-borne diseases including malaria and cholera. As many as 96,000 acres will be cleared of forest and submerged. `` We continue to have concerns about this project and will pursue them again with -LRB- World -RRB- Bank management as one of our top priorities,'' the agency says. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has asked for such `` early warning'' reports to be made every six months. `` We do not consider the list all inclusive,'' the agency explains. It adds that the object is to encourage better planning of new loan projects with the environment in mind. Six of the loans would go to <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, including one from the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> for $ 120 million to help a government effort that has moved over 1.2 million families out of the overpopulated islands of Java and <LOCATION> Bali </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agency says it is worried about insufficient help to people being moved, displacement of those who already live near the new settlements, danger to water supply and to wildlife. Another controversial project also involves the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, and its continued support for a major overhaul of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s electric power system. It involves a loan of $ 500 million. The agency says it is concerned about the impact on <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s Indian populations and the region's `` sensitive ecosystem. British and West German officials joined the Americans in talking to the bank's management in January. They were told that the loan had been delayed until September or October, mostly for economic reasons. The potential value of the 31 loans could be much higher than $ 3 billion. No estimates were available for five of them. Others are for major projects on which the banks have already made loans and may make more in the future.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was getting his early morning exercise walking down a <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> street, when someone gave a cry of recognition: `` Hey, is n't that <PERSON> Caliguiri </PERSON>?'' No, it was n't <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Caliguiri </PERSON>: It was the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination. `` I guess the mayor and I look alike,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said as he described the Sunday morning greeting. `` There's an old saying in Italian: ` One face _ one race.' We're all part of the same family.'' Far ahead in the polls here for Tuesday's primary, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said the incident shows `` we need to do a lot of work to make sure people know who <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is on the ballot.'' The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor himself is working hard _ taking a whistle-stop train tour across western <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> on Sunday and making a six-city flying tour of the state today. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is looking for a fourth straight big-state win here over his surviving competitor _ <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> _ to tighten his grip on the front-runner's crown and widen his margin in the delegate count. `` If we can win big here Tuesday, it will give us a tremendous boost,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told a big crowd of students on the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> State University campus, who were welcoming back his wife, <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> graduate. Through the cold, cloudy day in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greensburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Johnstown </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Altoona </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> hit over and over again on his message of good jobs and economic development in a region devastated by changes in the steel and coal industries. `` If we ca n't bring good jobs and economic opportunity back to the Johnstowns of this country, then there is something the matter with us,'' he told a crowd there. `` I believe we can. I believe we're going to.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> drew the parallels between <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s economic troubles of the past and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s troubles of the present. `` As a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Englander </LOCATION>, we went through the same kind of pain and economic distress as you have,'' he said in <LOCATION> Greensburg </LOCATION>. `` Our communities have come back and these communities are going to come back.'' Drawing on the two weekend debates between the Democrats, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> talked of how he and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> agree on many issues. `` Instead of investing in a lot of exotic weapon systems of very marginal value, we've got to take these resources and put them _ as both Rev. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and I said Saturday _ into our infrastructure.'' But on Sunday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> brushed off suggestions from <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> that he should put out a budget. `` You ca n't prepare a budget now for next year _ that's absurd,'' he told reporters on the chartered <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> train, nicknamed the `` <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Presidential Unlimited. And <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> resisted pressure from a new <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> tactic, urging massive new spending on education, drug control efforts and other programs. The front-runner went down his own list of education programs _ which he says involve only modest spending increases _ while <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said the federal government should double its spending on education. `` We're not going to run the nation's school system from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` The thing a president has to do is to set some priorities and get after them.'' The Democratic candidate also took a couple of swipes at <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, saying that the Republican nominee-to-be seems more interested in building aircraft carriers than in rebuilding the nation's railroads and highways. `` Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was critical of me ... because I oppose spending $ 36 billion on two supercarrier task forces that we do n't need and we ca n't afford,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` If he thinks that's where we ought to put our scarce resources, then so be it. But it's going to be a fundamental issue in this campaign. `` I think I know where the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are _ they are tired of crumbling bridges, congested airports, jammed highways, homeless people on streets and in doorways ... and they want a change.'' If <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is the Democratic nominee, perhaps he will get a wish expressed wistfully in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. `` All of you know me. I suppose we'd all like to suppose that I'm a household word,'' he told the small crowd. `` I'd like one of these days to come to <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> and hear, ` Hey, is n't that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>?'''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> says predictions that the Star Wars missile defense system wo n't work `` are like saying 10 years before we had helicopters that helicopters were doomed to failure.'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> on Sunday defended the administration program to create a hi-tech space shield against Soviet missiles, saying a panel of non-government experts believes the system is `` fundamentally sound.'' He disputed a report in Sunday's edition of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> that quoted an unpublished congressional study as saying the system would `` suffer a catastrophic failure'' if it were used against a multiple missile attack from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` That's about `` like saying 10 years before we had helicopters that helicopters were doomed to failure,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said in an interview on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Week with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>.'' The study was conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assessment </ORGANIZATION>, a non-partisan scientific arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said he had a panel of non-government technicians and engineers evaluate <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION>, and it concluded that `` the program is fundamentally sound and that we can build a militarily effective SDI -LRB- strategic defense initiative -RRB- program, and that is the goal.'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has been studying the congressional report, which he described as long and complex, but he said there has been no official comment on it. He said SDI is `` a program that we are currently designing. It has not even entered the developmental stage, much less the deployment stage.'' Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported in Monday's editions that a high-level Pentagon panel has recommended to <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> that he sharply cut the proposed initial SDI deployment from a system of space-based weaponry to a less costly and much less effective system of ground-based rockets. Quoting unidentified senior <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials, the newspaper said the panel directed by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s senior scientific advisory group, has told <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> that such a ground-based defense is worth pursuing as an initial step. Last September, then-Defense Secretary <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> approved the acceleration of six SDI programs, the first decision to push Star Wars technologies from pure research toward development. The six projects then entered what is known as a `` demonstration and validation'' phase, in which various components needed for a working system would be tested. No decision has been made on which of the six would be the first deployed. The six programs, which had been recommended by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acquisition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s highest internal review panel, include: _ The ground-based surveillance and tracking system, a missile that could be fired into space to obtain tracking information on missiles approaching the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ The space-based surveillance and tracking system, a satellite system that would be deployed in space to identify and track enemy missiles _ The boost surveillance and tracking system, another type of orbiting satellite system that would provide an alert if enemy missiles were launched _ The re-entry vehicle interception system, small missiles that could be fired from the ground to intercept and destroy enemy missiles during the middle and latter stages of their flight _ The space-based interception system, small `` kinetic kill'' rockets on an orbiting platform in space The rockets could be fired at enemy missiles shortly after launch and would destroy them through a direct collision. _ And the battle management-command, control and communications system, the `` brains'' of any Star Wars defense This would consist of a series of high-powered computers that would be programmed to select targets and direct weapons against them. In the interview Sunday, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said the Post story on the report by the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assessment </ORGANIZATION> `` took selected quotes out of that report'' and drew conclusions from them. `` What you're reading from is some kind of a leaked document,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said it had obtained the report's `` summary chapter.'' The newspaper said the report shows that detailed computer instructions needed to destroy thousands of warheads streaking towards the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> probably can not `` be produced in the foreseeable future.'' The overall conclusion of the report is that, despite five years and $ 12 billion worth of scientific research, `` many questions remain about the feasibility of meeting SDI goals,'' which include the ability to ward off a Soviet missile attack and eventually eliminate the threat posed by Soviet missiles.

<TEXT>
 Inmate <PERSON> Dora </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeters </PERSON> used to spend her days at the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Reformatory for Women in <LOCATION> Marysville </LOCATION> dreaming about life outside prison walls. She's still serving time for manslaughter, but now she spends her days in this city 50 miles from prison renovating dilapidated houses with other inmates. The work is done under the supervision of trained carpenters, not corrections officers. `` It's a nice feeling to be trusted like this,'' she said recently, sitting on the front stoop of a house she is helping rebuild. `` It's a good feeling to work with your hands. One day there's nothing there. Soon, the job is finished and you're proud of what you've done.'' Ms. <PERSON> Teeters </PERSON>, 29, who was convicted in 1984, is one of about 120 inmates from the women's reformatory and <ORGANIZATION> Lima </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> who have worked for <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>'s Rehab Project. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Berger </PERSON> is the mastermind behind the project, a non-profit organization founded in 1977 that buys and renovates 15-20 abandoned houses each year. The homes sell for $ 25,000 to $ 35,000, usually to low - and middle-income families <PERSON> Berger </PERSON> started using work-release inmates in 1983 with minimum-security male prisoners from the <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> prison. That was interrupted when the state changed the rules for honor inmates, said <PERSON> Berger </PERSON>, the organization's executive director. He called officials at the women's reformatory and they agreed to participate, marking the first time female inmates were used in such a project in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. `` The whole purpose was to teach fundamentally untrained people how to build housing,'' he said. Under the guidance of the five full-time Rehab Project employees, the women do all the carpentry work, from gutting to finishing. They do n't do electrical work or plumbing, both licensed trades, or major excavation or floor covering. In the last 11 years, the project has helped rehabilitate 160 houses. In his office in an abandoned church, <PERSON> Berger </PERSON>, a former seminary student, said about 7,000 of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>'s 18,000 houses need extensive repair. Rehab Project targets houses in different neighborhoods, hoping others will spruce up their houses themselves. When the program began, Rehab Project bought abandoned houses, bid repair work to contractors and then sold the houses. That changed in 1979 when the organization became dissatisfied with the quality of the work and realized it could not recoup the cost of the extensive repairs needed. So for the last nine years, it has used volunteers. The program currently uses 20 inmates but has a commitment from the corrections department to expand to 80. Once in place, those crews will be able to renovate 30 to 40 houses a year. Rehab Project not only allows prisoners freedom to work, it improves self-esteem and teaches a trade, <PERSON> Berger </PERSON> said. `` We have watched teriffic transformations happen with people who have been out with us; people who had never imagined themselves doing this kind of work; people who had never had one inkling that they could be up on a roof, not just working, but somehow knowing how to install roof shingles, installing furnaces, installing new dry wall and finish,'' he said.

 It was a typical night at <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON>'s, that ordinary restaurant with the extraordinary clientele: <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> was at his table. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Finney </PERSON> held court at another. <PERSON> Paloma </PERSON> <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON> stopped by. And owner <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> table hopped, playing the amiable host, the worldly-wise wisecracker, the sounding board to the stars. That was Saturday. Tonight is expected to exceed even the starry standards of <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON>'s as friends help celebrate the first quarter-century of the cluttered <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> restaurant. Among those who said they'll be there: actresses <PERSON> Raquel </PERSON> <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, director <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Lumet </PERSON>, developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, writer <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> and model <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiegs </PERSON>. `` This place is a living <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>,'' said bartender <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>. <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON>'s, a watering hole for writers, a wellspring for gossip columnists and a favorite target of food critics, remains an anomaly in the fickle world of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> restaurants. It's a friendly-looking place with a reputation, deserved or not, for rudeness. It has lasted 25 years despite universally bad reviews. And though it is filled with beautiful people, it may seem a dingy dump to those who know of it only through the gossip columns. `` Just a nice, neighborhood restaurant,'' is how <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> describes it. `` A good bottle of wine, a nice plate of pasta _ I mean, that's life.'' Author <PERSON> Gay </PERSON> <PERSON> Talese </PERSON>, a regular from the start, said, `` There's no officious maitre d' in black tie, saying, ` Wait at the bar while I see about a table.' Here, you have the bespectacled, stout and smiling <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> greeting you and saying, ` Of course there's a table for you.''' Of course _ for him. For <PERSON> Talese </PERSON>, that means one of the large round tables along the right-hand side, <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON>'s Wall of Fame, so to speak. Though it's not true that tables are hard to come by, it is true that the prominent ones are kept open for the regulars. Others are shunted to the rear. `` I'm afraid you do n't get treated very well if you do n't have a pencil in your top pocket,'' said author <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Plimpton </PERSON>, whose colleagues at the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Review were among the first regulars. A few weeks ago, it was American Literature 103 along the wall: <PERSON> Talese </PERSON>, <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Mailer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Vonnegut </PERSON>, <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. `` Writers do tend to get together, somewhat like grackles, and what better telephone wire than the tables at <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON>'s?'' said <PERSON> Plimpton </PERSON>. When <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> plunked down $ 10,000 for a Hungarian bar in the unfashionable <LOCATION> Yorkville </LOCATION> section in 1963, she already knew some show folk, writers and artists from her days as a waitress and cafe manager in <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>. `` Actually, what I did was just bring the Village uptown,'' she said. One day, the artist couple <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Motherwell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Frankenthaler </PERSON> stopped by, and `` they kept coming in. And they would bring their friends.'' Once primarily a writer's haunt, it has become a requisite stop for celebrities from all walks, from Prince <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> to <PERSON> Prince </PERSON>, <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> to <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, who set the opening scene of `` <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'' in <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON>'s, comes because `` he loves to people-watch,'' <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> said. `` It's comfortable, nobody bothers him, we make him what he wants. Anyone who wants to spend $ 3.50 for a bottle of beer can stand at the bar and people-watch, too, and listen to the stories. Like the time <PERSON> Mailer </PERSON> and a lady friend were asked to leave after arguing with <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> over whether he could unscrew a light bulb above their table. `` As he got up, he said, ` Put the bill on my tab,''' <PERSON> Plimpton </PERSON> recalled, `` and <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> said, ` You have n't got a tab here, <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>.' He reached into his pocket and threw a handful of change _ there was a great clattering of coins on the floor _ and by now it was a bit of a melee.'' <PERSON> Mailer </PERSON> vowed never to return, and in fact had his own restaurant for a while. `` But they always get pulled back, somehow,'' <PERSON> Plimpton </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Pravda: Two Years Later, Problems Remain At Chernobyl</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two years after the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> power station was the scene of the world's worst nuclear accident, nepotism, sloppy repairs and drunkenness are rampant at the facility, Pravda charged. The problems cited by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily were similar to those the government blamed for an explosion and fire at the plant on April 26, 1986. Last July, three officials in charge of the plant during the accident were convicted of gross negligence and sentenced to 10 years in a labor camp. Pravda said on Sunday that during the last two years engineering jobs at the plant have been handed out to medics, teachers, veterinarians and people without any higher education. It also accused Chernobyl's managers of trying to `` resolve at any cost'' obstacles to full electricity production at the plant `` to the detriment of the quality of repair and maintenance of extremely intricate equipment.'' `` Judging from all this, the leadership ... has not learned a lesson from the past,'' Pravda said. `` It's as though there has n't been an accident. The explosion at the plant 80 miles north of the Ukrainian capital of <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> killed 31 people, spewed radiation around the world and forced the evacuation of 135,000 Soviets living nearby. The scathing attack in Pravda was a departure from the numerous articles appearing in the Soviet press before Tuesday's anniversary. Previous stories have stressed the extensive safety equipment installed at <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION>, improved worker training, the decrease to safe levels of radiation and the return of people to surrounding areas. Pravda began by reporting safe radiation levels at the plant and the production of 21 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity there since the accident. But then the focus turned to criticism by the <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> region's <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> committee of `` Kombinat,'' the organization supervising the plant and cleanup around it Plant equipment was repaired without technical supervisors and was not tested before being put into service despite serious defects, the newspaper said. Some safety measures planned on the reactor No. 4 at the plant were not carried out because of <ORGANIZATION> Kombinat </ORGANIZATION>'s negligence, Pravda said. That reactor, in which the explosion occurred, has been sealed in concrete laden with radiation sensors. Other official reports have stressed the danger from the No. 4 reactor has been neutralized. `` Leadership posts were given to people who had criminal records, who had been excluded from the party or had received strict party penalties,'' Pravda said. `` Units were headed by people not able to cope with the business they were entrusted with: medics, teachers, veterinarians and people not having any higher education were working in engineering posts,'' Pravda said. Discipline was slack, the newspaper said. `` In the ` Kombinat' amalgamation, drunkenness, thievery and violations of labor discipline have not been reduced,'' it said. Pravda did not say whether any corrective action had been taken, other than to report that <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> party leaders reprimanded <PERSON> Kombinat </PERSON>'s head, and indicated he had been fired `` <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ignatenko </PERSON> displayed liberalism and political immaturity in the evaluation of the lack of discipline: multiple violations of organizational and financial discipline, protectionism, nepotism, moral breakdown of leaders,'' the paper said. The article indicated that plant managers tolerated the shortcomings because of a widespread problem in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> industry: pressure to fulfill a production plan. The government has said it must increase the production of nuclear power plants to meet the country's electricity needs. The Chernobyl plant, with two of its four reactors now operating, has been ordered to generate 19.9 billion kilowatt-hours this year. Hints of problems at the plant first came in December. <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukyanenko </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> head in <LOCATION> Slavutich </LOCATION>, a new town for plant workers near <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION>, told a newspaper that sloppy work, poor discipline and safety violations at the plant contributed to 36 accidents over a 10-month period, three of them fatal. <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Semyonov </PERSON>, deputy head of the Chernobyl clean-up commission, denied at a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> news conference on Wednesday that any major accident or deaths occurred at the plant since the 1986 explosion.

<HEAD>Labor Party: Voters Will Have Final Say On Peace Pact</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KARIN LAUB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The left-of-center <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> adopted a campaign platform saying <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will never completely withdraw from the occupied territories and that voters will be asked to approve any <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace settlement. The platform for November's election appeared to be more hard-line than the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> peace initiative initially backed by <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the foreign minister in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s coalition government. The platform adopted Sunday apparently was aimed winning over voters on the right who might consider the party too `` dovish.'' Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>, meanwhile, told the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday that 1,700 Palestinians, more than one-third of the 4,900 arrested since protests began Dec. 8, were being held without trial for up to six months. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> media said <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> also criticized the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> during the Cabinet meeting, saying it was hampering army efforts to deport more Palestinian agitators. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has deported 20 Palestinians to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since Dec. 8 and ordered the expulsion of at least four others. Also Sunday, the army lifted a four-day ban that had prevented Arabs in the occupied lands from traveling to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The army also permitted the delivery of gasoline to the occupied areas for the first time in more than a month. No major clashes were reported between Arabs and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers in the occupied lands on Sunday. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> platform promised voters a final say, either through elections or a referendum, on any <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace settlement, said <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Michal </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>. The platform, written by <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, also says <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will never withdraw completely from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> it captured in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war, Ms. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. It calls on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to seek direct negotiations with a <LOCATION> Jordanian-Palestinian </LOCATION> delegation, to be preceded by an international peace conference with strictly ceremonial functions. The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> would not participate in the talks. A negotiated interim agreement on limited self-rule for the 1.5 million Palestinians in the occupied lands would remain in effect for up to five years. The document also specifies that a final settlement should allow no <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, preserve all Jewish settlements there and maintain <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> as the united capital of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. It says areas with a high percentage of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> residents may be turned over to Palestinian-Jordanian control. These specifics in the platform go beyond the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> peace initiative, which do not dictate any such terms. The section on settlements remaining intact presumably would conflict with the views of the American government, which has consistently urged limiting Jewish settlements in the occupied territories. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>' call for giving <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> voters a final say on any peace plan has not been stated before. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> peace initiative also has never directly said that any international peace conference would be strictly ceremonial in function. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> head of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc said on Sunday that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would `` never part with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>.'' In a speech to the central committee of his <ORGANIZATION> Herut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> also suggested that gradual and limited <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> self-rule was as far as he was willing to go. Labor and <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> are in the fourth year of a fragile coalition. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> traded jobs in October 1987. Also Sunday, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> asked the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> for an additional $ 162 million to cover the cost of combating the Arab uprising, said spokesman <PERSON> Eitan </PERSON> <PERSON> Haber </PERSON>. He would not elaborate, and it was not immediately clear if that sum represented all the money the ministry has spent in connection with the uprising since Dec. 8, or only a part of it. Last month, the <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said the uprising has cost <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> $ 312 million in lost production, lost exports and added security costs. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> also said 165 Palestinians have been killed in the uprising, including 147 by the army. According to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> figures, the Palestinian death toll has reached 173. An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier and Jewish settler also have died.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>'s government is battling to win crucial legislative elections and overcome revelations of high-level corruption and widespread public distrust. The governing <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is expected to win the largest number of seats in Tuesday's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> election, but it may have trouble retaining its majority. Government failure to keep control would be a major boost for the opposition. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, who began a five-year term in February, says the government must retain control of the assembly to keep its promises of sweeping democratic, social and economic reform. He accused the opposition of dividing the nation and fomenting unrest. `` I still believe that the history of hate and darkness can never be resolved through revenge and that love and reconciliation are the only cures,'' <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> said during the campaign. Surveys by leading South Korean newspapers indicate the governing party may fall short of its goal of winning 125 of the 224 assembly seats to be decided by voting. The surveys indicate it was assured of about 65 seats and was neck-and-neck in about 80 other districts. The assembly's remaining 75 seats will be divided on the basis of how many votes each party gets. The assembly's power was increased by a new constitution and the president can no longer dissolve it. But the rival opposition parties have repeatedly failed to unite against the government and they are seen as having little chance of winning. The rival parties depend largely on regional support. Many opposition supporters are disillusioned by the disunity and squabbling for power between main opposition leaders <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON>. They drew a combined 55 percent in December's presidential race, but their individual candidacies both trailed <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s 36 percent plurality The two Kims symbolically resigned after the loss, but remain in control of their parties. The opposition has tried to discredit <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> and his party with a corruption scandal involving former President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s younger brother, <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyung-hwan </PERSON>, was charged on March 31 with embezzling a fortune in cash, stocks and land while he headed the semi-official Saemaul development program. A government probe uncovered extortion, influence peddling and theft. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Reunification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> claim the government has exposed only part of the corruption. Opposition leaders allege <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> and other top leaders helped cover up corruption when they served under the Chun administration. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON> told a rally, `` The DJP's call for overwhelming support for what they describe as social stability is nothing but a clear-cut expression of its determination to prolong rule by military officers tainted by political interests.'' The government has fought back by insisting the issue was raised because of <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s promise during the presidential campaign to expose corruption under his predecessor. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has experienced significant political liberalization since last summer and most controls on political activity have been dismantled. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> has promised full democracy as quickly as possible. But <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> has not won broad public acceptance. Many Koreans are distrustful of <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> as a former general who helped put <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> in power with military backing in 1980. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> has attempted to cut his ties to <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> and his authoritarian rule. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, who hoped to retain some power, was forced to give up his remaining posts as a result of the corruption affair and his hard-line loyalists in the party were purged. Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets last June in massive protests against the Chun government. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> backed opposition demands for elections at the height of the violence. Electioneering for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> has been restricted by limits on the number of rallies and bans on most forms of street campaigning. `` A uniquely lackluster atmosphere prevailed in stumping rallies,'' The <ORGANIZATION> Korea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> reported in an analysis. Candidates from all the parties have wooed voters with cash, meals, day trips and other gifts that are a customary part of electioneering. Newspapers calcuate millions of dollars have been spent. Scattered violent clashes between rival supporters have marred some rallies and the government warned it would not tolerate unrest. But the campaigning has been far less violent than in last year's presidential election. `` The politicians should not disappoint the people of this nation anymore,'' said political analyst <PERSON> Rhee </PERSON> <PERSON> Chong-ik </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 The first round of the presidential election was a historic moment for two political parties. The far-right <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> achieved unprecedented support, and the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> tumbled to an all-time low. Perhaps most important for the future of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> was the 14.5 percent won by <PERSON> Jean-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. The party has emerged as a significant new force in French politiics with its strident anti-immigrant, `` French first'' campaign. `` Nothing ever again will be done in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> without the voters of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>,'' exulted <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON>, 59, after the results became clear in Sunday's election. He said there has been a `` radical transformation of the national -LRB- political -RRB- landscape.'' Premier <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, who will face <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> in the May 8 runoff, won only 19.9 percent of the vote and desperately needs <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> support if he is to have any chance of overtaking the president, who scored 33.9 percent. <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> has vowed he will not do a deal with <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> for his backing, but he may have no choice but to do so despite the nearly universal condemnation it will bring him. <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> says his instructions to his voters will depend on what <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> says and does in the coming week. While <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON>'s performance was a surprise, well above the 10 percent to 12 percent he had been accorded in pre-election opinion polls, the 6.8 percent won by <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Lajoinie </PERSON>, the official <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> candidate, was predictable and confirmed the steady decline that began in 1981. The stodgy, tightly structured <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has been losing members for a decade, essentially because it has failed to adapt its language to a changing French society which is better educated, more sophisticated and less doctrinaire. The Communists were hampered by the candidacy of <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Juquin </PERSON>, leader of a splinter reformist movement who won 2.1 percent. The poor showing of the official <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> candidate could lead to further internal party dissension of the sort that led to the rebellion by <PERSON> Juquin </PERSON> and others over the past four years. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which once was the major force on the French left accounting for more than a quarter of the vote, began to fall significantly with the 1981 presidential election when party Secretary General <PERSON> Georges </PERSON> <PERSON> Marchais </PERSON> won only 15.3 percent of the vote. That fell to 11.3 percent in the 1984 election for the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and 9.8 percent in the 1986 National Assembly election. Sunday's score was the lowest registered by the <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in a national election since the party was founded in 1920. The previous low was 8.4 percent in the 1932 legislative vote. In the 1974 presidential election, <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> won a minuscule 0.7 percent. In 1981, he was not even able to gather the 500 signatures of elected officials necessary to get on the ballot. But in 1984, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, thoroughly vilified by all of the traditional parties, nearly equaled the Communists in the European vote with 11 percent and matched them in the 1986 legislatives with 9.8. <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> <PERSON> Megret </PERSON>, <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON>'s campaign manager, called 1988 `` a major turning point in the political history of our country.'' <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Bachelot </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> deputy in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, said the score was `` not just the most remarkable event of the first round of the presidential elections, it is the essential political event of the post-war period.'' The combined vote of <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, head of the conservative Rally for the Republic party, and former Premier <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Barre </PERSON>, supported by the center-right <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, totaled less than 37 percent, a serious setback for the traditional rightist parties. Though <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> rejects making overtures to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, he boldly addressed <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON>'s favorite themes in a short television appearance after the election was over. He appealed to `` all those who want security to be assured, and delinquence, criminality and terrorism to be fought with all necessary firmness, our national identifity to be preserved and clandestine immigration also to be fought ...'' Political analysts generally agreed that <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON>'s newfound support was based as much on a widespread dissatisfaction with traditional parties as his anti-immigration and law-and-order stands. `` I am a little ashamed for <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> that a man like <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> ... has won 4 million votes,'' said <PERSON> Marchais </PERSON>. `` That poses a problem for me and that poses a problem for my country. He has taken votes from the working-class electorate.'' He added that <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> had `` no reason to be proud'' of a man whose policy is `` founded on racism.'' <PERSON> Lajoinie </PERSON> stressed that he `` waged my campaign not to be elected, but to affirm demands for new policies.'' He added: `` In that context is is obvious that the real influence of the <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> goes very far beyond the results that we registered today.''

 Your county government spends an average $ 426 apiece to provide each of its residents with public services, according to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. And the largest counties spend even more. A survey of county governments released Sunday found spending by counties averaged $ 426.22 per resident nationwide in the 1985-86 fiscal year. But counties with populations of 500,000 or more spent an average of $ 503.99 per resident, while counties of fewer than 100,000 spent $ 383.12 per resident, the report found. Seven counties spent more than $ 1,000 per resident to provide services, the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> noted. They were lead by <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, Md. which spent $ 1,684 per resident. While education generally is a small share of most county governments per resident spending, the report found it made up as much as half of the spending for the four counties with the largest per capita expenditures.

 A government economist says it would be less costly to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy to add a gasoline tax of 2 or 3 cents than to steer car buyers away from purchasing big cars. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleit </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> staff, says the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy would lose $ 4.80 for every gallon of gas saved in dissuading people from buying big cars while just as much fuel would be saved by an additional tax on gasoline of 2 or 3 cents a gallon. `` People clearly get pleasure from buying large cars and I do n't see anything illicit in that at all,'' <PERSON> Kleit </PERSON> said in an interview about his report, `` The Impact of Automobile Fuel Economy Standards. He said the report represents his own views and not those of the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> which published it as Working Paper No. 160. Current Transportation Department standards require manufacturers to meet a 26 mpg fuel efficiency standard. But that standard will increase to 27.5 mpg for the 1989 model year unless the department acts to make changes. The lower standards, imposed in 1975, were meant as a fuel-saving alternative to higher taxes on fuel or imported crude oil. But environmentalists who want to see less fossil fuel burned support the higher standards. But opponents of the higher standards, including auto safety proponents, estimate that a 1 mpg increase in the standard for 1989 cars could mean an extra 220 to 390 deaths a year for a decade because the large cars people might be discouraged from buying are generally considered safer than small ones.

<HEAD>Report: States Should Provide Prenatal Care For Poor Women</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee says it is costing the government three to 10 times more to provide neonatal intensive care and other health and education expenses for babies born prematurely than it would to provide care for pregnant women with incomes below the federal poverty level who have those babies. And the panel, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, recommended Sunday that states be required to provide prenatal health care to prevent premature births. The committee said only 26 states are currently taking advantage of a two-year-old option to extend Medicaid to all pregnant women with incomes below the federal poverty level. `` Since the majority of women below the poverty line can not possibly afford health insurance, it is necessary to require Medicaid coverage for pregnant women below the federal poverty line,'' the report said. Citing various studies, the report said professional prenatal care, not including labor and delivery fees, costs about $ 400, while the lifetime cost of health and custodial care for a low-birthweight handicapped infant can amount to 100 times that much. About 40,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> infants born each year die before their first birthday, a rate higher than many other industrialized nations.

<HEAD>Report Says Sexual Harassment of Women in Marines Still a Problem</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A task force report says it's up to the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> commandant to set the tone that will help remedy continuing sexual harassment of women in the corps. The report released Sunday said existing directives and the corps' primary grievance system are `` appropriate tools to implement <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> policy on this issue'' but emphasized that the commandant must convey that sexual harassment will not be tolerated in the service. The Task Force on Women in the Marine Corps, formed in September 1987 at the request of then-Secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, also said the corps did not have a `` significant problem'' with fraternization. The report recommended certain steps to improve the quality of life for female Marines, including solving the problem of shortage in uniform items and lengthy delays in filling special orders, ensuring full investigation when homosexual conduct is suspected and allowing a pregnant Marine to request a 30-day delay in the notification of her commander by the medical officer. Women account for about 10 percent of the nation's 2.1 million military personnel.

<HEAD>Israel, US Company Push For Export Permit For Air-Launched Bomb</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense contractor and the Israeli government are trying to get the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to grant the company an export license so it can aid <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in designing an air-launched armor-seeking eapon system. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have refused to issue the company the necessary license because they say the system would violate a six-year ban on the sale of `` cluster bomb'' technology to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. In the memo from C.R. <PERSON> Bergwin </PERSON>, director of export license administration for <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> to under secretary of state for security assistance, science and technology the company argues that the ban should not apply to the $ 50 million contract. `` In order that we may proceed with the program, we urgently require an interpretation that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government's cluster munition policy does not apply to our contract,'' <PERSON> Bergwin </PERSON> wrote. He said the company believes that the 1982 ban was aimed at cluster bombs designed to be used against people, not against tanks and armored vehicles. The White House imposed the cluster bomb ban on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 1982 after evidence surfaced that the devices were used by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> against civilians during its invasion of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, an apparent violation of assurances <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had previously given <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> residents who get a mysterious ache or pain are apt to grasp for the easy explanation _ radiation from <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION>. Such is one of the lingering scars of the world's worst nuclear accident: a fear of what long-term health problems will result from the explosion and fire two years ago at the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear plant, 80 miles north of <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION>, the Ukrainian capital. A <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> resident, speaking during a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> visit on condition of anonymity, said some people blame everything from headaches to toothaches on radiation from <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION>. This is despite the government's repeated assurances that radiation levels in the region are normal and safe. Doctors in accident-affected regions are spending most of their time `` combating radiophobia,'' the government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> reported in February. A Soviet pediatrician said last August that more than 2,000 healthy children were born to mothers who lived around <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> during the April 26, 1986 disaster, which killed 31 people and spewed a cloud of radioactivity worldwide. But an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> doctor who treated some <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> victims, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gale </PERSON>, wrote April 1 in Pravda that the accident's long-term effects can not be predicted. He guessed that problems could include birth defects, genetic deviations and an additional 6,000 cancer victims in the next 50 to 70 years. Although a Pravda report on Sunday criticized nepotism, drunkenness and sloppy repairs at the plant, other reports marking the disaster's second anniversary portray life returning to normal. They say Chernobyl's reactors are generating electricity again and people are living nearby in once dangerously radioactive areas. But the fear of nuclear power remains. Taking advantage of Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s campaign for `` glasnost,'' or more openness on some issues, nuclear power opponents have been speaking out and in some cases halting construction of new nuclear plants `` Who will say that each of these atomic power stations, built or planned, does not conceal another potential Chernobyl?'' Ukrainian writer <PERSON> Oles </PERSON> <PERSON> Honchar </PERSON> asked at a conference last October. The government's answer: `` One can say now with confidence that even a recurrence of the errors which were made in Chernobyl would not lead to such a disaster,'' Nuclear Power Minister <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukonin </PERSON> told the Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> last week. Officials say the public's fears are unjustified. Plans call for doubling by 1990 the amount of electricity generated by nuclear plants from the 1985 level of 28 million kilowatts. Part of the increased production is from the Chernobyl plant itself. But the resumed production reportedly is not without its costs. <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukyanenko </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> head in <LOCATION> Slavutich </LOCATION>, a new town for plant workers 35 miles from <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION>, said last December that sloppy work, poor discipline and safety violations at the plant contributed to 36 accidents over a 10-month period, three of them fatal. <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Semyonov </PERSON>, deputy head of the Chernobyl clean-up commission, denied at a news conference last week that any major accident had occurred at the plant since the 1986 explosion. Last July, three officials in charge of the plant during the accident were convicted of gross negligence and sentenced to 10 years in a labor camp. The government blamed the accident on human error in shutting down safety systems to conduct unauthorized experiments. In January, the ruling Politburo put the accident's cost at $ 13.8 billion. Another price paid was in people's shaken faith in the government's ability to harness nuclear energy safely. The newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Komsomolskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> said nuclear plants once lent prestige to a city, `` but that was before Chernobyl.'' Popular opposition has prevented building two nuclear plants near the Ukrainian city of <LOCATION> Odessa </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Byelorussian </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Minsk </LOCATION>. Construction of a nuclear plant in the Russian city of <LOCATION> Krasnodar </LOCATION> was halted because residents complained it was in an earthquake-prone area and too close to a nature preserve. Public complaints appear to have been at least partly behind the government's May 1987 decision to stop building two additional reactors at <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION>. Thirty Ukrainian scientists, writing Jan. 21 in the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Literaturnaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ukraina </ORGANIZATION>, criticized on ecological grounds the government's plans to add reactors to three other plants. They accused the government of ignoring the `` bitter lessons of Chernobyl.''

 Political rivals have staged scattered attacks with fists, rocks and firebombs, injuring scores of people in the 18-day campaign for Tuesday's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> elections. Exact injury figures were not available, but as of today, police reported 87 cases of election-related violence nationwide, with 140 people detained and 77 of them formally charged so far. On election eve, an opposition party accused police themselves and governing party members of beating up about a dozen ranking opposition members in a dispute over campaign tactics. Firebombs and rocks have been thrown at campaign rallies and at political party offices, and rival supporters have clashed over such things as the content of campaign leaflets and the placement or removal of posters. Anti-government students shouting `` Down with the military dictatorship!'' have hurled rocks and firebombs at riot police, although student protests are a regular feature in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. On Sunday, police said they arrested four students in the southeastern city of <LOCATION> Taegu </LOCATION> for allegedly throwing a firebomb at a governing party candidate as he spoke at a rally. No one was reported injured. <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> <PERSON> Il-yung </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, expressed his regret in a statement today over corruption and violence in what he called an overheated campaign. In a news conference in <LOCATION> Pusan </LOCATION> today, opposition leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON> called the government a `` gangster regime,'' saying it was resorting to violence to try to win Tuesday's election. He charged that governing party workers had beaten up or kidnapped eight people in <LOCATION> Pusan </LOCATION>, including the son of his fellow <ORGANIZATION> Reunification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Kwang-il </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON> said the governing <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> had organized about 100 gangs in each election district to intimidate opposition members. In <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Reunification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> spokesman charged in a statement that police and governing party members beat up a dozen <ORGANIZATION> Reunification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members when 30 opposition members, including some candidates, went to a police station on Sunday to protest the detention of student volunteer campaign workers for allegedly pasting opposition stickers on governing party posters. Last Thursday, in his first news conference since taking office in February, President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo accused the opposition parties of fomenting unrest. In a warning to both sides, he said: `` Whoever violates the law and destroys <ORGANIZATION> democratic </ORGANIZATION> order must be punished severely in the name of the people.'' Tens of thousands of police in full riot gear turned out to guard nearly 170 joint campaign rallies over the weekend that marked the end of major campaign activity. Today, campaign rules barred candidates from speeches or house-to-house visits, but handing out of leaflets still was permitted. Press reports said 20 governing party members beat up six supporters of opposition leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> early today in <LOCATION> Haenam </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>, and 70 <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> members retaliated by throwing firebombs and rocks at a district governing party office, injuring two of its members. In <LOCATION> Chongsong </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, police today said they were looking for five governing party members on charges of breaking into a district office of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and beating up candidate Nam Sang-kul and three other people. There also were press reports in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> of opposition party members seizing governing party members, claiming they were distributing leaflets that slandered opposition candidates. Police reported detaining 173 people throughout the country in connection with non-violent election law violations, and formally charging 120 of them. The cases have involved tearing or pasting over election posters and allegedly slanderous campaign leaflets.

 President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> has distanced himself from the modern <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> he founded and projected a new centrist image in his effort to defeat conservative Premier <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> in the May 8 runoff. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> is very much an insider in French politics despite his leftist label. The bald, avuncular incumbent is a veteran of four presidential elections, has held many Cabinet posts and enjoys one of the highest status symbols in French society as a former fighter in the World War II resistance. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, 71, was first elected May 10, 1981, in a Socialist tidal wave that ousted center-right President <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Giscard </PERSON> d'Estaing. A month later, the same tide pushed out conservatives and centrists who had held power in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> for 23 years. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> also has known presidential defeat. He was beaten by Gen. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaulle </PERSON> in 1965 and by <PERSON> Giscard </PERSON> in 1974. But from 1981 to 1986, <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> and his Socialists wielded political control in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. That ended in the March 1986 legislative elections, when voters returned rightists to power in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, creating for two years what the French call `` cohabitation.'' The Socialists' early free-spending policies were abruptly reversed and stiff austerity measures instituted. High unemployment also dragged down the president's popularity to as low as 27 percent at midterm. With the Socialist legislative defeat in 1986, <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> began to take on a new face. He slipped into the role of elder statesman, developing an image as the wise grandfather above the day-to-day battles of governing. He distanced himself from his party, abandoned revolutionary rhetoric, and began to reach out to the political center. His popularity soared again, consistently reaching an approval rate of 55 percent or more. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> was born Oct. 26, 1916, in <LOCATION> Jarnac </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. He earned degrees in law and letters in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. He was drafted in 1938 and shot and captured during the <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> invasion of May 1940. Escaping from a prisoner-of-war camp in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, he returned to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. The Germans were occupying the Vichy zone of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> helped create a resistance network. His career-long feud with <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaulle </PERSON> began during the war when <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> refused to merge his resistance group with <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaulle </PERSON>'s. It was also during his resistance days that he met <PERSON> Danielle </PERSON> <PERSON> Gouze </PERSON>, whom he married in 1944 shortly after the liberation. During the chaotic post-war Fourth Republic, <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> held 11 Cabinet posts, including interior and justice minister. In the early 1970s, <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> took the moribund <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and built it into a major force. But the Union of the Left he forged with the Communists fell apart in 1977. It was not until the final days of the 1981 presidential election that the two major leftist parties again joined to defeat <PERSON> Giscard </PERSON> and oust the conservatives. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> shocked much of the West when he brought Communists into his government. But that new union lasted only until 1984 when the Communists pulled out in a dispute over economic policy.

<TEXT>
 Whatever artist <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> touched during his lifetime _ from brightly painted cookie jars to a 1974 Rolls <PERSON> Royce </PERSON> _ seems to have turned to gold by frenzied bidding at an auction of his collection of art and kitsch. During the first two days of the 10-day sale, jewelry, furniture and decorations owned by the late artist fetched $ 6,222,892, said <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, the auction house. On Sunday, a pair of pottery cookie jars depicting a black chef and a black woman sold for $ 23,100 _ about 200 times their estimated price. `` The interest in the <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> collection is very high and we're looking forward to eight more days of <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> interest and excitement,'' she said Saturday's sale, featuring art nouveau and art deco pieces, brought in $ 5,314,347, more than double what had been expected. On Sunday, the bidding produced a total of $ 907,995, three times more than estimated, according to Ms. <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON>. <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON>'s collection of paintings, drawings and sculpture _ from 19th century landscapes and portraits to a 1977 collage on paper by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Rauschenberg </PERSON> _ was scheduled to go on the block today. People lined up around the block Sunday to get into <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s, and more than 1,000 packed the auction room during 4 -LCB- hours of bidding, said Ms. <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON>. The highest bid was $ 77,000 by a <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> collector for a <ORGANIZATION> Rolls-Royce </ORGANIZATION> Silver Shadow sedan, which had a presale estimate of $ 15,000 to $ 20,000, she said. The 175 cookie jars on sale, projected to bring in $ 5,000 to $ 7,000, fetched $ 247,000, Ms. <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON> said. `` I think people felt they were interesting, appealing, amusing, whimsical,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON>. `` And the <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> factor was certainly at work in achieving these prices.'' About 150 of the cookie jars were bought by <PERSON> Gedalio </PERSON> <PERSON> Grinberg </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Movado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Watches </ORGANIZATION>, which has developed a Warhol watch that will be sold starting in September, she added. Among the other sale items was a group of unmounted semiprecious stones, mostly quartz, which sold for $ 10,000 _ 10 times the presale estimate. When a large golden hair ornament went for $ 1,300, auctioneer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Redden </PERSON> commented, `` Something actually sold in the estimates.'' A series of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> lithographs, signed in pencil by the late ex-Beatle, sold for $ 10,450, just over the presale estimate of $ 7,000 to $ 9,000. The lithographs depict <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>'s marriage to <PERSON> Yoko </PERSON> <PERSON> Ono </PERSON> and their honeymoon. A director's chair with <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON>'s name on the back sold for $ 6,050. It was expected to bring only $ 100 to $ 150. <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON>'s collection of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> classical and federal furniture, called by <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s the largest and most important available for auction in years, will be sold Tuesday. Before the sale began, <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s expected the entire collection to sell for $ 10 million to $ 15 million. <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON> said the high prices were attributable `` to some degree -LRB- to -RRB- the <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> factor, but to a great degree the quality and rarity of the objects.'' More than 10,000 items, including paintings, rare art deco furniture, watches, clocks and photographs, are included in one of the most extensive sales ever held by <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Proceeds will benefit the <ORGANIZATION> Andy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warhol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Visual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION>, which will award grants to cultural institutions in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and abroad. <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> died at age 58 last year.

 A group of <ORGANIZATION> Brandeis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students has turned the addition of pork and shellfish to the student menu into a debate on the institution's Jewish origins. About 55 students demonstrated Sunday against the menu items that go against kosher dietary laws.

The protesters in turn faced a counter-demonstration by students who said the anti-pork faction was exhibiting a hostility toward non-Jews that has damaged <ORGANIZATION> Brandeis </ORGANIZATION>' reputation in the past. `` <LOCATION> Brandeis </LOCATION> and the administration is backing away from its Jewish pride,'' said protest organizer <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolisky </PERSON>. <PERSON> Claudia </PERSON> <PERSON> Salomon </PERSON> agreed, saying `` <ORGANIZATION> Brandeis </ORGANIZATION> needs to retain that Jewish quality. It should be a diverse community, but it should know that it has a Jewish character.'' <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Tankin </PERSON>, who also is Jewish, engaged several of the protesters in a heated argument. `` What you're trying to do is apply laws to people who are n't kosher,'' she said. Student <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> held a small sign with the message: `` Do n't discriminate against freedom to choose.'' <ORGANIZATION> Brandeis </ORGANIZATION> is officially non-sectarian, but about 60 percent of the 2,800 undergraduate enrollment is Jewish. The university has long offered non-kosher foods, such as dishes that mix dairy products and meat. The university's board has no plans to change the pork and shellfish policy, said <PERSON> Sallie </PERSON> <PERSON> Riggs </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <LOCATION> Brandeis </LOCATION>. `` Many of the comments that were made are either one-sided or half the truth,'' <PERSON> Riggs </PERSON> said of the demonstrators. She said about 300 students are on the university's kosher food plan and have a separate and newly expanded cafeteria. <PERSON> Riggs </PERSON> said the menu additions stemmed from a report by the university's board last year on a range of issues. Among them was a desire to offer a menu compatible to all types of students. For example, shellfish and pork are major parts of the diet of Asians, <PERSON> Riggs </PERSON> said. One section of the report was titled, `` A return to the historical non-sectarian emphasis of the university,'' <PERSON> Riggs </PERSON> said. The report reflected the board's concern that the university was perceived as a Jewish school. `` It is not a religious school. It's not a Jewish school. It's a non-sectarian university,'' <PERSON> Riggs </PERSON> said. American studies Professor <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> supported the protest but acknowledged to the gathering, `` this is very often, and you know it, a hostile and clannish and unfriendly place for those who are non-Jewish.'' Still, <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said it was as important to avoid alienating Jews who observe kosher laws. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> called the new food policy, `` a statement by <LOCATION> Brandeis </LOCATION>: ` I'm a little bit ashamed of being Jewish.'''

 An explosion and fire ripped through a paint store late Sunday and spread to four other buildings, injuring three people, authorities said.

Four buildings were engulfed in flames when all off-duty firefighters were called in to staff stations. After the explosion in the paint store, the blaze spread to apartments upstairs, and to a tavern and brewery housed in a converted bowling alley on the city's east side, fire officials said.

 An estimated $ 42 million was raised for the March of Dimes by more than 600,000 Americans to fight birth defects.

 Premier <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, an energetic leader and a tireless campaigner, will need to draw on those traits as he fights what is expected to be an uphill battle in next month's runoff presidential election. The neo-Gaullist, who has been head of the government for two years, finished second in the first round of the election on Sunday, receiving 20 percent of the vote compared to 34 percent for President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>. When <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> faces <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> in the May 8 runoff, the conservative premier will be challenging the president who appointed him. One poll released Sunday predicted <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> will win the runoff with 55 percent of the vote. By finishing second Sunday, <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> improved on his first presidential run seven years ago. He lost out in the first round in 1981, finishing third behind former President <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Giscard </PERSON> d'Estaing and <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>. <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> became premier in March 1986 when the conservatives ousted the Socialists from control of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in legislative elections. He then formed the new Cabinet and was formally named premier by <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>. <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>'s conservative Rally for the Republic is the largest party in the center-right government coalition. The energetic premier has at various times been compared to a bulldozer, a computer and a robot. While <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>'s immense energy and ability to make tough decisions rapidly is considered a key asset, critics consider it a liability. There are those who feel he is too impulsive to be president. <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> is simple in his tastes and acknowledges he likes Western movies, detective novels, gin rummy and a good glass of beer. He is the champion of a liberalized free-market economy. <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> was born Nov. 29, 1932, in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. He was educated in the capital, except during World War II period, and spent most of his holidays at the family's country home in the south-central <LOCATION> Correze </LOCATION> region. After graduating from the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, he fought as a lieutenant in the Algerian War. He completed his studies at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, whose graduates are destined for the top ranks of the civil service. A frequent visitor to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> hitchiked around <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> as a youth, working for a time as a fountain clerk at a <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> restaurant. He was a protege of the late President <PERSON> Georges </PERSON> <PERSON> Pompidou </PERSON>, who referred to him as `` my bulldozer.'' <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> won his first election in 1967 _ a seat in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> from the <LOCATION> Correze </LOCATION> district. He became a secretary of state in the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, then moved on to be minister for relations with <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, agriculture minister and interior minister. In 1974, at the age of 41, he became premier for the first time under Giscard d'Estaing. <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> resigned after two years, complaining of a lack of authority and disagreement over economic policy. In 1977 he was elected mayor of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, a post he continues to hold. Instead of supporting Giscard d'Estaing in the runoff against <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> in the 1981 election, <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> told his supporters to vote their conscience, a move believed to have contributed to Giscard d'Estaing's defeat and a source of bitterness between the centrists and conservatives.

 The old issues were blurred with ambivalence for some of the'60's revolutionaries who grappled with their past during a reunion at <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. The adrenaline surge they remembered from the former struggle has been tempered by wistfulness, perhaps, because the dream did n't last `` It did n't just die; it was profoundly defeated,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurwitz </PERSON>. a freelance cinematographer who thought a majority's greed overcame a minority's ideals. `` You become an anachronism _ and a very bitter one _ if you're not careful,'' said <PERSON> Bettina </PERSON> <PERSON> Berch </PERSON>, who was among the hundreds of former protesters who last weekend marked the 20th anniversary of a weeklong student uprising that shut down the Ivy League campus `` One of the things that makes me sad is that people who are younger than us picked up on the drugs and forgot most of the rest of what we were saying,'' said <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, 40. `` Drugs were our biggest mistake.'' During panel discussions, a party and an indoor picnic, they recalled how about 1,000 people, mostly students, barricaded themselves inside five buildings the week of April 23, 1968. The protest drew international attention to the issues of racism, the Vietnam War and the status quo in general. `` This has plunged some of us into a lot of memories that one still feels ambivalent about,'' said <PERSON> Berch </PERSON>. After college, <PERSON> Berch </PERSON> clung to her anti-establishment leanings. She said she was `` kicked out of academia'' in a tenure fight after seven years of teaching at <ORGANIZATION> Barnard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> and is now writing a book. `` In their own terms, we were an aberration, a time when they lost control,'' she said. `` We became very difficult creatures.'' Some people refused to discuss their feelings, saying the reunion had brought back painful memories. `` I remember seeing people I knew with arms in slings and heads in bandages,'' said <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, now a law editor. Acting <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> Dean <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> was held hostage during the revolt. Professor <PERSON> Orest </PERSON> <PERSON> Ranum </PERSON> lost a decade's research when a protester torched his files. Later, <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Gold </PERSON>, a member of the radical Weather Underground, was killed when a homemade bomb exploded in a <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> townhouse in 1970; <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> is serving a 75-year prison sentence for his role in a 1981 armed car robbery. At a panel discussion, an audience of 500 applauded more youthful memories of the two men. Others chose to recall the lighter moments: _ The wedding of <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Egan </PERSON> in occupied Fayerweather Hall; Episcopal chaplain <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> crawled in through the window _ A pie tossed in the face of a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> colonel recruiting on campus _ <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Naison </PERSON>, now a historian, taking his Ph.D. oral exam in a building that was under occupation He passed the exam and his professors left through a window. `` There was a sense of real life, real peace, real happiness,'' said <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>. `` There was a feeling of opening up _ people engaging in real dialogue. People who had gone around like little moles began to speak up.'' `` -LRB- There was -RRB- incredible unity, a kind of physical feeling,'' agreed <PERSON> Hurwitz </PERSON>. `` It was a triumph of morality in a way that morality has rarely triumphed since.'' `` It's sort of sweet, like people around the campfire,'' said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Crebs </PERSON>, 33, of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, about the reunion. The returning alums opted for bluejeans or baggy corduroys, a few teamed with ties and sports jackets, a few with paunches. There were plenty of smiles and embraces, and buzzwords like `` the perversion of capitalism'' surfaced now and then. `` Up against the wall!'' hollered members of the audience, invoking the once-familiar phrase to request that a podium be moved away from the movie screen at a panel discussion. They applauded <PERSON> Abbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, who wore a tie-died T-shirt and sat in the front row _ a prominent bald spot and a red bandana adorning his frizzy, gray hair. <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> had helped fuel the strikers' conviction, along with <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON>, <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rap </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stokely </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmichael </PERSON>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunstler </PERSON>, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginsberg </PERSON> and the Grateful Dead. `` It was not a prank or a party, although many have described it as the best time of their lives,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudd </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, who was chairman of Students for a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> in 1968.

 Wildlife rescuers fear hundreds of more birds could be found coated in some of the 21,000 gallons of crude oil that spilled along 10 miles of <LOCATION> Suisun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. More than 100 oil-covered birds and other wildlife were taken Sunday to <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Walnut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> to be cleaned following Saturday's spill just outside the northeastern reach of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, where it joins the <ORGANIZATION> Sacramento-San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joaquin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>, rescuers said. `` Oil and marshes do n't go together,'' said <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> McNabnay </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diablo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's doomsday for the little birds and the big ones.'' Cleanup crews used vacuum trucks, skimming boats and absorbent barriers at various sites to mop up the oil, which began leaking into <PERSON> Peyton </PERSON> <PERSON> Slough </PERSON> and then <LOCATION> Suisun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> from drainage pipes leading to a storage tank at a <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> refinery. Workers mainly tried to contain the thick, gooey slick in the slough and the adjacent <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marsh </ORGANIZATION>, a bird habitat. `` We've classified this as a major oil spill,'' said Capt. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Zawadzki </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. Officials warned that the biggest threat to wildlife would come if any of the oil reached marshes on the northern side of the bay or wetlands along the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. If the oil reached the bay, it would be virtually impossible to contain, said Capt. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Broddrick </PERSON> of the state Fish and Game Department. `` It would race up and down the bay with the tide and affect hundreds of miles of marshland,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Berkeley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bird </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> reported receiving 55 ducks covered with oil. They were expected to survive. About 40 birds received at the <ORGANIZATION> Alexander </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lindsay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Walnut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> also were in good condition, said Ms. <PERSON> Granados </PERSON>.

Officials did not know how many birds have been found dead at the scene. Two were reported to have died at the rescue centers. The spill occurred at the peak of the nesting season, said state wildlife biologist <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 Thousands of Armenian-Americans rallied in three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities to commemorate the 73rd anniversary of a massacre in which Armenians claim more than 1.5 million of their countrymen were killed by the Ottoman Empire. In <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, at least 13 protesters were arrested Sunday after they smashed windows and burned a symbolic Turkish flag during a protest at the Turkish Consulate, police said. Most of the demonstrators had been part of a crowd of 10,000 who gathered earlier Sunday at <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. `` We ca n't change the tragedy that occurred 73 years ago under the Ottoman Empire, but we can and we must change the way the world thinks about that genocide,'' <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> told the crowd. <PERSON> Vasken </PERSON> <PERSON> Khodanian </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Armenian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said Armenians want the Turkish government to recognize the killings and compensate the survivors. Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif., told the crowd he has asked President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to discuss the plight of Armenians during the summit with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> is a republic of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` Let us hear no more of glasnost if ... <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will not guarantee Armenian rights. Let us not think that 1915 can not happen again,'' he said. The Los Angeles Armenian community of 200,000, the largest outside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, annually commemorates the massacre. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, more than 2,000 people gathered in Times Square. `` We are here to try to get <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to pass a resolution to declare April 24 as a Day of Remembrance and to get the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to drop the word ` alleged' when referring to the Armenian genocide,'' said <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Azadian </PERSON>, a rally organizer. Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> told the crowd: `` The truth is that there was an attempt by the Ottoman Turks to destroy the Armenians and thank God they were not successful _ but the truth is they tried. If we do not remember what happened to the Armenians we will not remember what happened to the Jews.'' Many survivors of the massacre were among the Times Square crowd, including 80-year-old <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Manuelian </PERSON>. `` When I was a little boy I remember the Turks coming and taking everything from us,'' <PERSON> Manuelian </PERSON> said. `` They took my father away and I never saw him again.'' Rep. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., told nearly 1,000 demonstrators in <LOCATION> Watertown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, that people everywhere had a moral responsibility to call attention to the tragedy `` Oppression and injustice to one people is a moral loss affecting all mankind,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. Leaders of the march in the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> suburb said the protesters also were expressing their solidarity with the people of the Soviet region of <LOCATION> Nargorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, which Armenians want attached to their republic. Foreign powers have ruled <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> for most of its history. On April 24, 1915, more than 200 Armenian intellectuals and political leaders were slain or deported by the crumbling Turkish Ottoman Empire, signaling the start of more than eight years of killings. Turkish officials have said that 300,000 Armenians perished in the turmoil of deportations and local reprisals. Some historians estimated 600,000 died.

<TEXT>
 Police were ordered to return gunfire with gunfire as they sought to end four days of violent clashes with <ORGANIZATION> Melanesian </ORGANIZATION> separatists in which 27 policemen were kidnapped and four killed. The violence disrupted elections in this <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> island territory in which residents voted for regional candidates and for a slate of nine candidates running in the first round of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s presidential contest French Minister for Overseas Territories <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> arrived in this archipelago late Sunday and instructed gendarmes to `` respond to arms with arms.'' <PERSON> Leopold </PERSON> <PERSON> Joredie </PERSON>, a leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Kanak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, today said the separatists would continue their `` mobilization.'' <PERSON> Pons </PERSON>' instructions were `` a declaration of colonial war,'' he added. The verbal confrontation followed four days of violence between police and pro-independence Melanesians that began with the storming of a police station Friday on the island of <LOCATION> Ouvea </LOCATION>, 90 miles northeast of the capital of <LOCATION> Noumea </LOCATION>. Twenty-seven gendarmes were taken hostage in the attack and three of their colleagues were hacked to death with machetes. A fourth gendarme injured in the attack died on Sunday in a <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. Three Melanesians were injured. The kidnappers demanded the regional elections be canceled and that police reinforcements be removed from the island. They also demanded that negotiators be sent from <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> to discuss independence for the island. `` We do not negotiate with terrorists and criminals,'' <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> said. `` These terrorists will be treated as terrorists.'' At dawn today, 11 of the hostages were freed, <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> Defense Minster <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Giraud </PERSON> announced in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. About 300 police continued combing a forest in northern <LOCATION> Ouvea </LOCATION> for the remaining 16 hostages. A <ORGANIZATION> Kanak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> statement issued in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> said the traditional tribal chiefs requested the release `` to avert reprisals against their tribe and the population'' by the French army. `` <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s policy in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION> today is worthy of a banana republic,'' the statement said. Later today, a teen-age <PERSON> Melanesian </PERSON> was fatally shot in a clash between police and militant separatists, the privately-owned radio station TUW reported. It said the youth died after French gendarmes and Kanaks opened fire as the police were leaving their post in the eastern town of <LOCATION> Canala </LOCATION>. On Sunday, an officer was shot in the stomach while guarding a polling station in <LOCATION> Canala </LOCATION>, on the island's east coast. Barricades were set up by the separatists to disrupt polling, ballots were burned, telephone lines were cut and police used tear gas to disperse crowds of protesters on several islands. Thirty-eight of 139 polling stations were closed because of gunfire and explosions which punctuated the elections as voters cast double ballots in presidential and regional elections. Officials said turnout in the voting, boycotted by militants seeking independence, was 56.3 percent. Conservative Premier <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, who finished second behind incumbent President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> with 19.9 percent of the vote in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, scored an overwhelming victory among those casting ballots in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>, taking nearly 74.6 percent of the vote. <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> will face <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> in a runoff election on May 8. In voting for 48 legislative seats, the pro-French Rally for the Republic in <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>, the territorial branch of <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>'s neo-Gaullist Rally for the <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, won 35 and the extreme-right <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> won eight Two small, right-wing parties won three seats, while dissident separatists won two. Those holding the 48 seats also will assist in four regional councils. <PERSON> Joredie </PERSON> said actions to disrupt Sunday's elections were a `` first step.'' `` The second step is the second round. We must establish a force sufficient to open discussions with the new government'' toward independence, he said. `` There are people here who are ready to fight to the end,'' he said by telephone. The new territorial assembly was created by <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>'s government over the objections of militant native Melanesians, known as Kanaks, who make up 43 percent of the island group's population of 145,000. Thirty-six percent of the residents are Europeans, while the rest are mainly Asian or Tahitian. Many of the Melanesians are demanding independence for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>. Police in <LOCATION> Noumea </LOCATION> said six gendarmes were injured Sunday in <LOCATION> Canala </LOCATION> by `` thrown explosives.'' They were taken to a hospital in <LOCATION> Noumea </LOCATION>, where one was listed in serious condition.

<HEAD>Panama Pulls Plug On Electricity To U.S. Embassy Annex</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s state-run electric utility shut off power to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy annex and the apartments of at least 45 of the embassy's 180 workers for not paying their bills. Also Sunday, the civilian chief executive who replaced ousted President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> named seven new Cabinet members to `` confront the grave situation facing the nation.'' Workers from the Hydraulic and <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> disconnected electrical meters at apartments of the embassy staffers, whose power bills have n't been paid in more than two months. The state utility regularly cuts off power to consumers who do not pay their bills for two months. `` The only difference here is that they did it on a Sunday and they targeted it all very deliberately,'' said <PERSON> Terence </PERSON> <PERSON> Kneebone </PERSON>, a spokesman for the embassy. `` Any other business, they normally would have done it on a workday.'' `` They obviously said, ` OK, we're going to take the gringos out,''' <PERSON> Kneebone </PERSON> said. He said the embassy itself and the residence of Ambassador <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> were left with power, although the electric bills for those facilities also had not been paid. Two weeks ago, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration ordered a ban on all payments to the government by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens and organizations. However, <PERSON> Kneebone </PERSON> said the embassy, which pays the rent and utility bills of its <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> employees, stopped making payments even earlier at the request of <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, whom the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> still recognizes as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s president. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> was deposed Feb. 26, one day after he tried to fire Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the nation's de facto leader, as chief of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s 15,000-member Defense Forces. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is under indictment in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> federal courts on charges of drug trafficking. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also imposed economic sanctions on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> which led to a severe economic crisis in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>, who announced the new Cabinet appointments Sunday, became the new chief executive after <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s ouster. <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> said he would name new heads of some semi-autonomous agencies and departments today. All ministers and department chiefs offered their resignations to him last week. The new ministers replace officials that <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> inherited when he replaced <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> said the primary goal of his new administrative team would be to reopen the nation's banks, closed since March 4 because of a lack of money to cover withdrawals by panicky depositors. He named <PERSON> Orville </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON> as treasury minister, <PERSON> Barisnel </PERSON> <PERSON> Espino </PERSON> as agriculture minister, <PERSON> Rolando </PERSON> <PERSON> Murgas </PERSON> as education minister, <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> as foreign minister, <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Bultron </PERSON> as public works director, <PERSON> Gustavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> as head of planning and economic policy, and <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Martans </PERSON>, chief of <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and a leading opposition figure, said the changes appeared to be aimed at giving the administration legitimacy, `` but I think it represents absolutely nothing really new for the public.'' He added: `` It remains an illegal government, run by General <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and nothing more than that.''

<HEAD>With Virtually No Cash Available, Panamanians Turn to Barter</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In cash-starved <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Horacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Icaza </PERSON> has added one of mankind's oldest forms of trade to his business skills. He barters. <PERSON> Icaza </PERSON>, whose firm <ORGANIZATION> Casa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> del </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medico </ORGANIZATION> is the nation's largest medical equipment supplier, recently worked out a deal with the government-owned water and power companies. He pooled some of his employees' water and electric bills, then told the utilities he would erase a similar amount from the debts they owed his firm for laboratory equipment. They agreed, and debts on both side of the ledger were wiped out _ without any money changing hands. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, suffering from sweeping <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions and the nearly two-month closure of its once-formidable banking center, has now become a barter economy. `` It stops people from starving to death, but it does n't get the economy moving,'' said a Western European diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` Panamanians have surpassed by much the traditional banking ability and capability of Swiss bankers,'' said former banker <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>. `` We have been able to do banking outside of banks.'' <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s economic crisis was caused by the controversy surrounding Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the nation's military leader and the power behind the civilian government. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is under federal indictment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug trafficking and money laundering charges. In a bid to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has cut off military and economic aid to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, frozen its assets in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and prohibited <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies and individuals from making payments to the government. The sanctions, combined with the closure of the banking system and a two-week general strike in March, have virtually paralyzed the economy. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar, the national currency, has become scarce. Its place has been partially filled by checks issued in small amounts by the government to pay its employees and Social Security recipients. With those checks, Panamanians can buy groceries at supermarkets or clothing at department stores. They also can send the checks back to the government to pay taxes or utility fees they owe the state-run water, electric and telephone companies. The checks, say businessmen, have become a quasi-currency. Late Saturday afternoon, the <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> family kept a close tab on the price-tags of the meat, chicken, cheese, bread, juice, fish, milk and eggs piled into a shopping basket at the Rey supermarket on <LOCATION> Via </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Espana </LOCATION>. They planned to fill the basket with food totaling $ 100 _ the amount of a Social Security check the elder <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> had received from the government. The Rey chain accepts government checks but gives no change on any unused portion. On down the street, <PERSON> Blanca </PERSON> <PERSON> Robles </PERSON>, an English and art teacher, used a $ 50 paycheck from the government to buy clothing at a department store, which had sharply reduced the prices on much of its merchandise. With the checks, businesses can turn around and pay taxes, duties or other fees owed the government _ all without dipping into scarce cash. Some of the savvy dealers approach people waiting to pay their utility bills, offering to swap a government check for their cash. Still others offer to give government employees and retired people cash for their checks, but at a discounted rate. A $ 100 check, for example, can bring $ 80 or so. Some corporate checks also have become a form of currency. Supermarkets have made arrangements to accept checks issued by their suppliers. The suppliers pay their employees in small-denomination checks, which can be used to buy food or other necessities. In a complicated arrangement, the supermarkets then return the checks to the suppliers in payment against their accounts, businessmen said.

 The dollar was steady in calm European trading today. Gold prices rose slightly. The dollar is likely to trade quietly in the coming days and may move a bit higher until midweek, several dealers said. But a <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> dealer said he expects a downturn for the dollar close to the end of the week since there are no substantial factors supporting the currency. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where the business day ends as <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s begins, the dollar rose 0.35 yen to a closing 125.00 yen.

 After nine days and 55 witnesses, prosecutors are almost done describing how a quiet clan of polygamists defied the state for nearly two weeks during which one of the 100 surrounding lawmen was killed. Talk of divine revelation and the Lord's will have colored the trial, just as it did during the siege at the farm occupied by 15 people, including defendants <PERSON> Vickie </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>, clan leader <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>, <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>'s brother <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>'s son <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>. Defense attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bucher </PERSON> describes the case as `` just a tragedy _ a heartbreak'' that few outside <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> could understand. For the authorities, it is a tale of fanaticism gone haywire. After an explosion ripped through a <ORGANIZATION> Mormon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> building in <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION> on Jan. 16, the clan's six adults and nine children barricaded themselves on their 2 -LCB- - acre farm, warning police to stay away For 13 days, the state's top police officials and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> experts from around the country surrounded the farm and hunkered down nearby, reluctant to storm the compound. Nevertheless, on Jan. 28 the siege ended in a shootout. State Corrections Lt. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> House </PERSON>, a dog handler, was killed while ordering two balking police dogs to attack ringleader <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>, who was shot and wounded by two agents. Within days, a federal grand jury indicted the defendants on charges of firearms possession, use and possession of a bomb, assault and attempted murder of federal agents. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> district court trial has been followed attentively by an odd mix of spectators, including a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> film producer, <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>'s two wives and a teen-ager who plans to marry <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> next month. `` You will hear evidence that this was more than just a bombing _ that it was an invitation to a violent confrontation,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> promised jurors in his opening statement. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> has produced much evidence that the wheelchair-bound <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON> was <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s killer and Addam Swapp the bomber. Prosecution witnesses have included Mormon bishops and journalists. <PERSON> Vickie </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON> told an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> negotiator in a taped conversation that the bombing was ordered by <PERSON> God </PERSON> as a sign of the impending collapse of church, state and nation. `` Yes, I am saying yes, the Lord did want that chapel bombed,'' said the 44-year-old clan matriarch who has appeared in court smiling and waving and wearing bows in her hip-length blond hair. The clan espouses practices taught by early Mormon leaders, including multiple marriages, which was abandoned by the Mormon church in 1890. Federal agents have testified about gunfire they dodged during the standoff, which came to a head when Mrs. Singer and <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> responded to written entreaties from Gov. <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Bangerter </PERSON> with dire prophecy and belligerence. <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>'s letter denounced the government and the Mormon church and declared the Singer farm a nation `` independent and separate from your wicked society of ever-changing laws and dark councils that seek to enslave the minds and souls of man.'' The clan had buttressed its resolve with the belief that <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>, husband of Mrs. Singer and father-in-law of Swapp, would be resurrected when society collapsed. Singer was fatally shot in 1979 outside the farm after he brandished a gun at authorities trying to arrest him on warrants stemming from his refusal to send his children to public schools. <PERSON> Bucher </PERSON>, <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>'s co-counsel, says the family's beliefs must be considered. `` The trial should be about the reasons and motivation of these people,'' he said. `` This case is simply not what it's made out to be. This is not a gang that got together to bomb a church.'' Still, <PERSON> Bucher </PERSON> is n't sure he'll give in to his client's desire to testify. He and the five other defense attorneys were n't happy when <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> showed up for the trial wearing a beaded buckskin jacket emblazoned with the flag of early Mormon pioneers. The nine feathers hanging from the jacket, reminiscent of the nine feathers on a spear left at the bombed chapel, symbolize the nine years since <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>'s death. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>, in a statement to agents after his arrest, said it was no coincidence the church was bombed two days before the anniversary of his father's death. He said it happened `` so that dad's death would be recognized. We could see there was no justice.''

 Only one man has been executed in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 40-year history. <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Eichmann </PERSON>, architect of the Holocaust, was hanged in 1962. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> attended today's session in a wheelchair, complaining of a bad back. A Christian, he was seen making the sign of the cross and whispering to himself, apparently praying, during arguments from prosecutors who demanded the death penalty. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s lawyers have said they will appeal his conviction to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Several hundred onlookers crowded into the converted movie theater to hear the verdict. Earlier, longtime observers said they expected the judges to sentence <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> to death because of their sweeping guilty verdict which discounted each defense argument. `` I believe a proven Nazi war criminal definitely deserves to be put to death,'' <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s son, 22-year-old <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> before the sentence was announced. `` But they are not asking for a death penalty here. They are asking for my father to be murdered _ because he is innocent,'' the younger <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> said, chain-smoking and pacing nervously. The Ukrainian-born <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> was found to be the guard `` Ivan'' who ran the gas chambers at the <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION> death camp in Nazi-occupied <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Some 800,000 Jews died in 1942 and 1943, when `` Ivan'' worked at the camp. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> has consistently alleged he is a victim of mistaken identity, although he admitted lying on his American emigration papers about his past. He contends he was held in a Nazi prisoner of war camp during the critical period in question. `` I am not <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> the Terrible, and to that God is the most just witness. He knows I am innocent,'' <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> told the court today. He spoke in Ukrainian.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> today said <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> faces a problem if <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> attempts to forbid <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships with nuclear arms from docking at its ports. `` It's up to all of us to measure up to our responsibilities,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said after briefing the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on his talks last week in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. He acknowledged prospects were dim that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would conclude a treaty to halve their strategic nuclear arsenals in time for the May 29-June 2 summit meeting in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` It's extremely difficult to get there,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said at a news conference before flying home. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said if a strategic arms reduction treaty -LRB- START -RRB- is not signed at the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration would keep pushing in its twilight months for an accord. `` We'll keep at it, we're not going to stop,'' he said. But he disputed suggestions that superpower relations had slumped since December's signing of a treaty last year to ban intermediate-range nuclear missiles. Citing the Soviet decision to withdraw an estimated 115,000 troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said of <LOCATION> East-West </LOCATION> relations, `` I think the picture is one in which we see general progress.'' After the session with the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> met privately with <PERSON> Uffe </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellemann-Jensen </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Danish </LOCATION> foreign minister, to register his concerns over a <ORGANIZATION> Danish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> resolution that could bar <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships with nuclear arms from Danish ports. On April 14, Danish socialists pushed a measure in Parliament that required the government to tell visiting ships that nuclear arms are barred from Danish ports in peacetime. For 30 years, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> has barred such ships from its ports, but the government avoided the provision by not asking ships if they were carrying nuclear arms. After the vote, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s center-right government, which opposed the measure, called for early elections on May 10. <PERSON> Ellemann-Jensen </PERSON> said, `` We want to get a clear message from our voters they want <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> to remain a full member of the alliance.'' <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> is one of the 16 members of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and among the leaders in pushing for nuclear disarmament negotiations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ellemann-Jensen </PERSON> said he wants to end <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s maverick position within the alliance. `` If we get the signal from the voters we are asking for, it will be possible to reach a fair solution.'' Such a solution would mean <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> sticks by its current ban on nuclear arms on its soil and simply expects visiting warships to respect that, he said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and British warships, as a matter of policy, never divulge if their warships carry nuclear arms. The Danish resolution has led <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to suspend visits to <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> vessels.

 Conservative Premier <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> today received the backing of the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> in his uphill battle to defeat Socialist President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> in the presidential runoff May 8. <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, a 55-year-old neo-Gaullist, finished a distant second in first-round voting Sunday to <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, who is seeking a second seven-year term. <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> picked up the support of the centrist party's leader, 64-year-old <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Barre </PERSON>, Sunday night shortly after polls closed. <PERSON> Barre </PERSON>, a former premier, finished third in the voting. The Union for <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> formally endorsed <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> today, but it was not known how many of its supporters would vote for <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>. Exit polls showed many members of the centrist party might support <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> in the runoff. `` I support him in his fight,'' said <PERSON> Barre </PERSON> of <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>. `` And I ask all those who voted for me to vote for him in the second round.'' However, <PERSON> Barre </PERSON> did not write <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> a blank check. `` I count on him to defend the objectives to which we are particularly attached, an open and tolerant society that rejects xenophobia, racism and extremism,'' <PERSON> Barre </PERSON> said. His comments were aimed at the candidate of the extreme right, <PERSON> Jean-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON>, who finished just behind <PERSON> Barre </PERSON> and whose endorsement could be key to a Chirac victory. <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, won 14.5 percent of the vote _ well above predictions. His campaign speeches included calls for deporting immigrants and quarantining victims of acquired immune deficiency syndrome. A cartoon in the leftist daily Liberation today showed <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON>, dressed as a stormtrooper, standing inside <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>'s open mouth and saying, `` From now on, nothing in this country gets done without me.'' In an editorial, <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> editor <PERSON> Serge </PERSON> <PERSON> July </PERSON> wrote: `` Two years under <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> have multiplied discontent with <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>. <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> has systematically welcomed this, once again making <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> an ` exceptional' democracy, the only one in the Western world where the economic and political crisis has engendered an extremist electorate.'' <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON>, 59, said he will tell his supporters at a rally on Sunday how to vote on May 8. An editorial in the conservative daily <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Figaro </ORGANIZATION> today said the task of attracting <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> followers without alienating <PERSON> Barre </PERSON>'s constituents was difficult but not impossible `` The right has no reason to call this a lost cause as long as <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> can rally around him all the men and women in this country who do n't want <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s re-election,'' <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Figaro </PERSON> said. With 98 percent of the vote counted on Sunday, the 71-year-old <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> had 33.9 percent, ahead of <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, who with 19.9 percent did not do as well as expected. <PERSON> Barre </PERSON> was third with 16.6 percent. A telephone poll conducted by state-run Antenne 2 television after the results were announced showed that <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> would defeat <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> in the runoff, winning 55 percent of the vote. In a brief statement, <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> said on Sunday: `` Now the choice is simple. To all of you who serve <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, we have great tasks before us. Let us rally together, neglecting no effort to win May 8.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, once a significant political force, slumped to its lowest score in party history, with <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Lajoinie </PERSON> getting 6.8 percent. Rounding out the nine-candidate field were <PERSON> Antoine </PERSON> <PERSON> Waechter </PERSON>, an ecologist with 3.8 percent; <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Juquin </PERSON>, leader of a splinter <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> reformist group, 2.1 percent; <ORGANIZATION> Arlette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laguiller </ORGANIZATION>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Trotskyist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strggle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> 2 percent; and <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Boussel </PERSON> leader of another Trotskyist group 0.4 percent. Turnout by <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s 38 milion voters was more than 82 percent. The choice facing French voters May 8 is more over what kind of president they want rather than the positions of the two candidates. This is <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s fourth presidential race. He was defeated by Gen. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaulle </PERSON> in 1965 and by <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Giscard </PERSON> d'Estaing in 1974 before winning in 1981. <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, a smiling, energetic campaigner, heads the neo-Gaullist Rally for the Republic Party. He has run the government since the right won the legislative elections in 1986 in what the French call `` cohabitation'' with a leftist president. The president is the chief of state. The premier, elected by the legislature, is the head of government. Sunday's vote marked the first time a president and premier have opposed one another in a presidential election. Discussion in the next few days is likely to focus on a date and format for a televised Mitterrand-Chirac debate. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> has suggested Thursday. <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> wants a date in the final week of the campaign. A debate is vastly more important to <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, who hopes it will help him make up ground against the president. On the issues, both candidates support an open economy and want to improve <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s education system, spending more on technical training and research. On foreign and defense policies, both speak of the need for <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> to become more involved in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s defenses.

<HEAD>12,000 Union Members Vote on Caterpillar No-Strike Proposal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PEORIA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Ratification of a limited no-strike clause will mean more jobs for <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s parts subsidiary, union and company officials say. Voting over several days by some 12,000 members of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> locals nationwide was capped Sunday with ballots in <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION>, where union officials reported large majorities favoring the no-strike agreement. A final official vote tally still must be transmitted from the union to the company, <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> <PERSON> Nolde </PERSON>, a company spokesman, said late Sunday. The agreement extends indefinitely the contract with <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Logistic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, a parts-distribution subsidiary that covers about 1,000 employees. Most of the workers are based in <LOCATION> Morton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, with some in <LOCATION> Delavan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>. Caterpillar officials, based in <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>, said they needed the no-strike clause to attract major contracts for CLS The subsidiary was formed in January 1987 to provide warehousing and distribution services for parts and equipment for companies around the world. CLS President <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON> said recently the company is ready to bid on or sign three such contracts in 1988, including one with the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. He said the contracts could translate into thousands of new jobs. Union officials had feared that without approval of the limited no-strike clause, the company might move the jobs to non-union facilities. Under the agreement, CLS parts-distribution workers will remain on the job even if the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> do n't reach a master contract agreement by Sept. 30, and even if manufacturing workers decide to strike. The parts-distribution workers would not be allowed to strike until after a new central bargaining agreement is reached. They then would have 60 days to negotiate a new local contract and could strike at the end of that period. `` We are pleased with the vote,'' <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Flaherty </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> vice president of employee and labor relations, said in a statement late Sunday. `` We can now talk to potential customers about continuing, reliable CAT Logistics service from facilities with <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> employees. It means more jobs, and that's good news.'' In <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>, the agreement won 62 percent of the votes cast from <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 974 </ORGANIZATION>, with 837 in favor of it and 519 against, said <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, the local's president. The vote covered plants in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mapleton </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mossville </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION>, Local 751 members who participated gave the agreement an 82 percent vote of approval, said Local President <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>. He refused to say how many of his 2,000 members voted, or to give the actual vote totals. `` I think the general sentiment is that if it could mean jobs, we've got to try it,'' <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> said. Union members in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Davenport </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, already had ratified the agreement.

<HEAD>Strike Against Car Bombing As Death Toll Reaches 70</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TRIPOLI, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> was brought to a standstill today as citizens went on strike to protest the nation's worst car bombing in three years. The death toll in the blast rose to 70. Police said 100 people remained hospitalized following Saturday's blast in a crowded vegetable market in this northern port city. A man wounded in the explosion in the low-income <LOCATION> Tabbaneh </LOCATION> district died early today, increasing the total number of dead to 70. Schools, shops, cafes, restaurants, cinemas, banks and other businesses were closed today throughout <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s second largest city, whose 850,000 people are predominantly Sunni Moslem. The strike, on the second day of a 48-hour period of public mourning, was called by city leaders. The explosion claimed the most lives of any car bombing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since March 8, 1985, when 80 people were killed and 250 wounded in an explosion in the Shiite Moslem district of <LOCATION> Bir </LOCATION> <LOCATION> el-Abed </LOCATION> in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. No group has claimed resonsibility for Saturday's blast in <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, 50 miles north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Earlier car bombings have been blamed on sectarian strife stemming from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 13-year-old civil war between Moslems and Christians as well as feuds involving Palestinians, Syrians and Israelis.

<HEAD>Peel Acquitted in Eight Fishing Boat Killings in 1982</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A lawyer for a former crewman who was acquitted in the killings of eight people aboard a fishing boat said the man's family may file suit because of the four-year ordeal that became the most expensive criminal case in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> history. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Peel </PERSON> was acquitted Saturday of eight counts of first-degree murder and one count of first-degree arson in the 1982 deaths aboard the Investor. He had been tried twice; the first trial resulted in a hung jury. `` It's terrible being an innocent man accused of a crime,'' <PERSON> Peel </PERSON> said. `` I just thank God it's over. Justice did work this time.'' Peel, a boatbuilder from <LOCATION> Bellingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, who once crewed on the Investor, was accused of killing skipper <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Coulthurst </PERSON>, his wife <PERSON> Irene </PERSON>, two Coulthurst children and four teen-age crew members. The Coulthursts were from <LOCATION> Blaine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, and three crew members were from the <LOCATION> Blaine-Bellingham </LOCATION> area. The Investor was found burning near the southeastern <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Craig </LOCATION> in September 1982, and <PERSON> Peel </PERSON> was not arrested until two years after the crime. `` From the moment it was issued, I have always said the indictment was not worth the paper it was written on,'' said defense attorney <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> Weidner </PERSON>. `` The prosecutors put an innocent man and his family through this ordeal for four years,'' <PERSON> Weidner </PERSON> said, adding that the family is considering a lawsuit to seek restitution. But he declined to say who might be the target of such a suit. On Saturday, <PERSON> Peel </PERSON>, 27, broke into tears and his family cheered when the jury announced its decision in <ORGANIZATION> Juneau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. His family had been with him throughout the three-month trial, with financial support from friends and family in <LOCATION> Bellingham </LOCATION>. On the advice of his attorney, Peel did not answer any questions. He and his wife, <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON>, declined comment on what they might do next. `` We're going to have no place to go but up from here,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Peel </PERSON> said. Prosecutor <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>, who handled both trials, told jurors the state had bungled the Investor investigation, had no evidence of a motive and no physical evidence against Peel. Nonetheless, she contended the prosecution could prove its case based on witnesses who said they saw Peel near the Investor around the time of the killings and in the fishing vessel's skiff after the larger boat was found burning in a cove near <LOCATION> Craig </LOCATION>. Peel was working on another fishing boat docked in <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> at the time. Peel's brother-in-law, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Perram </PERSON>, said Peel can return to a job at <LOCATION> Perram </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Bellingham </LOCATION> boatyard. `` I'm sort of like a zombie,'' said <PERSON> Peel </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Peel </PERSON>. `` It's been a long three days since the jury went out.'' Relatives of the victims said they were disappointed. `` Somebody ought to pay,'' said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who was related to five of those slain. `` I do n't say it should have been Peel, but it should have been somebody.'' `` I thought after being up there for a couple of weeks -LRB- watching the trial -RRB- that they would find him guilty, as they should have,'' said <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Moon </PERSON>, mother of slain crew member <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Moon </PERSON>, who was at her home in <LOCATION> Bellingham </LOCATION>. The state spent $ 2 million on the investigation and on <PERSON> Peel </PERSON>'s first trial, and budgeted $ 700,000 for the retrial The defense rested its case the second time without calling any witnesses. `` I did n't put a case on because there was no need to dignify this case by putting on witnesses,'' said <PERSON> Weidner </PERSON>. Jury deliberations began Wednesday evening. The jury forewoman said members of the panel had agreed not to talk to reporters. Peel had been in his parents' custody on a $ 1 million property bond since his arrest in September 1984.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Mansfield </PERSON> today called on <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to join in dropping trade barriers and contribute more to its own defense. <PERSON> Mansfield </PERSON>'s remarks came two days after Japanese farmers smashed and burned an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> car, torched boxes of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oranges and set fire to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag in a rally in western <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The estimated 300 farmers were protesting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demands that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> end its restrictions on imported beef and oranges. For two hours today, <PERSON> Mansfield </PERSON> answered questions at the invitation of a foreign affairs and defense committee of the Japanese legislature. The former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senator, a specialist in international affairs, was asked by committee chairman <PERSON> Takenori </PERSON> <PERSON> Kato </PERSON> of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> about the agricultural issues that have embroiled the two countries in disputes since the quota system on beef and oranges officially expired April 1. <PERSON> Mansfield </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not want to destroy the agricultural economy of any country. He urged both nations to work toward developing a world market for food to take care of starving people. Also during today's questioning, <PERSON> Mansfield </PERSON> promoted his proposal to include <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in a Free Trade Agreement, which is intended to remove trade barriers between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and put them on an equal footing. But he acknowledged that neither country had shown any interest in the plan. <PERSON> Mansfield </PERSON> said the `` prospect looks very bleak indeed'' for such an accord, even though the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is working on similar proposals with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. However, he said handling trade problems on an issue-by-issue basis only increases `` the dangers of retaliation, misunderstanding and the like.'' <PERSON> Mansfield </PERSON> said an intermediate-range nuclear weapons agreement under review by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would put more pressure on nations to strengthen their conventional forces at a time when the world is already too heavily armed and too much money is being spent on weapons. Although he said he wants <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to help share the military burden, he said he does not want <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to violate its constitution, which prohibits military action other than defense. He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is no longer in a position to carry the burden of defending other nations as it did after World War II. But he also said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic woes `` have been problems of our own doing,'' and he called on <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to help. <PERSON> Mansfield </PERSON> said he would like to see a purely economic union created in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Gas Price Average Jumps More Than 2 Cents in Two Weeks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The average price of gasoline nationwide jumped 2.67 cents to nearly a dollar a gallon in the past two weeks in what is seen as a precursor to even higher prices during the summertime peak driving season. `` We have a dramatic leap in the retail price of gasoline across the nation,'' <PERSON> Trilby </PERSON> <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON> said Sunday after compiling results of the <ORGANIZATION> Lundberg </ORGANIZATION> Survey of prices at 12,000 gas stations in every state. The latest two-week survey ended April 22. The average price of 98.84 cents includes all grades and sales categories as well as taxes. `` The greatest increases were found in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>; the smallest in the <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> region,'' Ms. <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON> said. Prices per gallon at self-service pumps were: regular unleaded, 89.90 cents; premium unleaded, 104.45 cents; regular leaded, 86.86 cents. At full-serve pumps, prices were: regular unleaded, 118.74 cents; premium unleaded 128.81 cents; regular leaded, 114.14 cents. `` There's a mixed bag of indicators for future trends because, although wholesale prices to all types of retailers are still on the rise, our spot price surveys show great variation with drops and hikes in the main trading centers,'' Ms. <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON> said. Crude oil prices, meanwhile, are holding and `` a good guesstimate might be that if they continue to hold, gasoline prices to motorists could continue to rise moderately in coming months in response to summer demand,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON> noted that most price change usually occurs at self-service pumps but the latest survey showed activity at full-serve pumps. `` This is a real push upward because the wholesale buying price increases that the retailers paid in the past couple of weeks were burdens they had to pass on, and they did,'' she said.

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Bus and tram drivers in the western city of <LOCATION> Bydgoszcz </LOCATION> went on strike today, forcing thousands of people to walk to work and testing <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s determination to limit wage increases in the face of steep price rises. Workers seeking higher pay listed 10 demands in their unauthorized job action. Negotiations were taking place with a deputy mayor and a deputy provicial governor at a streetcar depot in the city, said a spokeswoman at the official transport workers union office. The drivers want wages to match those earned in other cities, as well as some management changes, she said. Officials said it appeared there would be no early end to the walkout. Solidarity Chairman <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said he was planning to travel from his home in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Bydgoszcz </LOCATION> to offer support. Prices in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> have gone up 42 percent since the beginning of the year, the result of planned increases mandated by a government economic reform program. The increases prompted nationwide pressure for pay raises among workers. Government figures said wages rose on average 45 percent by April 1. Polish leader Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, alarmed by the trend, last month warned enterprise managers they could be fired if they were too generous with their payrolls, thereby fueling inflation. Government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> said the unauthorized walkout at the <ORGANIZATION> Provincial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bydgoszcz </LOCATION> began today at 6 a.m. `` The first shift refused to work,'' Urban said in a telephone interview. `` I ca n't say it is the biggest strike -LRB- in recent years -RRB-. I ca n't even call it a strike. They did n't declare a strike and it has no organized form.'' Second-shift workers also refused to begin work at 2 p.m., said a spokeswoman at <LOCATION> Bydgoszcz </LOCATION> transit headquarters. A parked bus blocked the gates of the main depot but there were few other outward signs of discord, said a Solidarity activist in the city, <PERSON> Ryszard </PERSON> <PERSON> Helak </PERSON>. Urban said the demands included a $ 15 a month salary raise, plus a eight cent increase in the 38-cent-an-hour wage. The union spokeswoman, who would not give her name, said the transit system employs about 2,800 workers. Urban said 229 buses and 60 trams were idled in the city of 375,000 people, located 150 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. `` It looks like it will take a long time to resolve it,'' said <PERSON> Halina </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarminowska </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <LOCATION> Bydgoszcz </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Voivoidship </LOCATION>, the provincial government. `` People had to walk to work this morning,'' she said. `` Factories which have buses drove people from the night shift home and then took those coming for the morning shift. Those working in offices, youths going to school, had to walk.'' <PERSON> Helak </PERSON> said Solidarity did not organize the strike. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> on Sunday said large-scale strikes might be needed to spur reform in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. The spokeswoman at the official union office in <LOCATION> Bydgoszcz </LOCATION>, one of the unions put together by the government after Solidarity was banned in the 1981 martial law crackdown, said the strike took her organization `` by surprise.'' `` It was an initiative of the drivers,'' she said.

He also signed an agreement for his <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to sell two Chinese companies technology to produce phosphoric acid. Hammer, 89, refused to disclose the dollar value of the new projects and insisted <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> is not losing money on the $ 800 million Antaibo coal mine in north <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the largest and most high-profile U.S.-Chinese joint venture. <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> has a 25 percent share in the mine, 230 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Shanxi </LOCATION> province. It opened with great fanfare in September but has been operating well below capacity because of mechanical problems and disputes with the Chinese partners over the price at which the coal should be sold. `` We consider the problems we have had there minor problems,'' <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON> told a news conference after signing the two new contracts at <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s luxious <LOCATION> Diaoyutai </LOCATION> state guesthouse. `` Those are the start-up problems you have with every project,'' he said. `` These will be settled and we will be at full production we estimate by the end of the year.'' Asked about the financial cost of the disputes and delays, <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON> said, `` We do n't figure we've lost anything.'' He insisted the mine can be profitable once it begins producing at its capacity of 15 million tons of raw coal per year, even if coal prices do n't recover from their current low of about $ 20 per ton. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> recently reported design problems with the mine's washing plant, which it said left too much moisture in the coal. It blamed the mine's low production level on the washing plant problem. There also have been reports of personal feuding between the Occidental and Chinese technical staff at the mine. Hammer said his current visit to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was not a trouble-shooting one. `` I'm not here because of those problems,'' he said. `` They are being straightened out without me. I came because the Chinese have invited me to celebrate my 90th birthday.'' Hammer turns 90 on May 21. Chinese President <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shangkun </PERSON> gave a banquet in Hammer's honor tonight and Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> invited him to a banquet Tuesday. <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON> said he hopes to sell <LOCATION> Antaibo </LOCATION> coal to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, which has no diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> but conducts a growing indirect trade with it. He said South Korean officials have invited him to visit and that he plans to bring up the subject of selling coal. <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> officials said one of the contracts signed today calls for construction of a coal preparation plant in central <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Henan </LOCATION> province with capacity to process 900,000 metric tons of raw coal for coking. No date was given for construction to begin. <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> holds a 55 percent share of the venture, while the <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a newly formed company under <ORGANIZATION> Henan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> provincial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> control </ORGANIZATION>, has 45 percent. The other contract calls for use of <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> technology at four phosphoric acid plants to be built in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wuhan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> were the purchasers.

 Sales of existing homes rose 2.5 percent in March, the second consecutive monthly increase in response to falling mortgage interest rates, a real estate trade group said Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> said existing single-family homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted rate of 3.33 million units last month `` Lower interest rates have stimulated activity, and the first quarter has turned out better than we anticipated,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON>, chief economist of the association, said in a statement. Rates for 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages, which had risen above 11.5 percent before the October stock market crash, edged below 10 percent in February and March. They have been rising in April and were 10.3 percent last week. The increase in March followed an identical 2.5 percent rise in February and three consecutive monthly declines before that. However, the sales level was still 9.8 percent below levels last year when interest rates were at a nine-year low. <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON> said he expected home sales to rise again this month. The sales increase was accompanied by a 4.1 percent rise in prices to a median, or midpoint, of $ 88,700, up from $ 88,100 in February. Sales were led by a 9.6 percent advance in the West and a 6.7 percent boost in the South. Sales were unchanged in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> and down 3.4 percent in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>.

 A shopper landed in jail after an off-duty policeman spotted him popping grapes in his mouth as he walked through a supermarket produce section. `` They're taking me for eating grapes!'' <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Culberth </PERSON> yelled as he was taken in handcuffs from a <ORGANIZATION> Winn-Dixie </ORGANIZATION> grocery store in the predominantly black and impoverished <LOCATION> Liberty </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> section of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Culberth </PERSON>, 55, was charged Saturday with petty theft and resisting arrest without violence. After spending the night in jail, he was released with a promise to appear for a court date. <PERSON> Culberth </PERSON>, a plumber, said he broke open a $ 1.65 package of grapes and plucked a couple into his mouth as he shopped with his wife and stepson. Off-duty <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> policeman <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who moonlights as a security guard at the store, saw <LOCATION> Culberth </LOCATION> and told him he would have to pay at once. `` He was given a chance to pay for the grapes and refused,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` I had no other alternative.'' But <PERSON> Culberth </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Linda </PERSON>, said the couple planned to pay for the fruit when their $ 30 order was rung up. `` How in the world is it petty theft if we're shopping? It's wrong, real wrong,'' she said of the arrest `` We always pay our bills.'' <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> policeman <PERSON> Erol </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, who also moonlights at the store, said <ORGANIZATION> Winn-Dixie </ORGANIZATION> has arrested about eight people in the past two years for refusing to pay for food they had eaten. Earlier this month in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, 52-year-old <PERSON> Eli </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> was charged with larceny from a building for allegedly eating two pounds of grapes in a grocery store. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, who could be sentenced to four years in prison if convicted of the felony, said he bought $ 14 worth of fruit in the store, and admitted he may have sampled only one or two grapes. The prosecutor in <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he filed the felony charge, instead of misdemeanor shoplifting _ which carries a 90-day jail term _ because several repeat shoplifters he's prosecuted have received probation.

 Soviet authorities have stripped the name of former President <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> from a city square in the capital of the republic of <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s name was dropped from the square in <ORGANIZATION> Alma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ata </ORGANIZATION>, the biggest city in the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> republic. An order from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet and the government's <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION> dated April 1 was included in a booklet of latest official orders received today by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The order did not indicate if a new name was chosen for the square. It said the workers of <ORGANIZATION> Alma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ata </ORGANIZATION> had asked that <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s name be removed from the square A city, some neighborhoods, numerous factories, a tank division, a military academy and other areas and institutions were named after the Soviet president following his death in 1982. But, under the leadership of <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> has been blamed for a period of stagnation and corruption in Soviet society. As a result, his name has been dropped in several instances. In January, a city of 460,000 people and a region of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> were stripped of <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s name. Officials announced in February that <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s son-in-law, <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON>, would be tried for corruption. The weekly newspaper <PERSON> Nedelya </PERSON> renewed the attack on <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> in its latest weekend edition, charging that <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> and members of his circle gave each other valuable jewelry, limousines and furs.

<HEAD>Zhao Ziyang Says Tibetan Separatists Will Fail</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> said today that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will deal forcefully with separatist movements, such as the one in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>, and that such movements are doomed to failure. `` Nowadays, a very small number of people are attempting to split our motherland,'' <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> said at a conference of 4,000 people representing <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s 56 nationalities. `` It is not difficult to see that they are not representing the interests of our people, and they are only the agents of some anti-Chinese foreign forces. Their vain attempt of splitting <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> can not possibly be realized.'' <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> did not mention <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> by name but it was clear that he was referring to the faraway province. The Tibetan capital of <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> erupted in pro-independence riots last fall and again in March. The bloody protests were led by <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks loyal to the exiled spiritual leader the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>. Tibetan authorities have allowed almost no foreign journalists into <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> and released few details of action taken against rioters. Sources in <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> have reported hundreds of arrests following the March disturbance. Chinese officials say five people died in the March riots. Unconfirmed reports have put the death toll as high as 24. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> must carry out a two-pronged policy to promote the interests of minority nationalities and `` forcefully oppose and deal with any separatist efforts.'' His comments were carried by the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> told the gathering that discrimination against minority ethnic groups is a problem everywhere in the world except <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. He claimed <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has banned discrimination against minorities, protects them by law and grants them privileges not available to <PERSON> Han </PERSON> <PERSON> Chinese </PERSON>, who comprise 92 percent of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s 1 billion people. Chinese minorities, which include 55 ethnic groups, were often the victims of persecution during the first three decades of Communist rule in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, when the government tried to eliminate religious worship and local languages and customs. In the past decade <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> has tried to redress some of the wrongs of the past and now encourages minorities, many who live in sparsely populated, strategic areas of western <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, to retain their traditions. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> is the author of a plan to give priority to economic development of coastal <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. There has been concern that <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>'s plan would further widen the income gap between the coast, which is mostly Han Chinese, and the interior where many minorities live in pockets of poverty. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> urged minorities to use foreign capital, science and technology to develop their economies and compete in national and international markets.

 An explosion and fire ripped through a paint store and spread to four other buildings, forcing residents to leap through windows to safety as a building collapsed, authorities said today. Twelve people, including five firefighters, were injured. At least 150 firefighters battled the blaze, which reached seven alarms, and all off-duty firefighters were called in to provide backup help at fire stations. `` There was an explosion and I was watching TV at the time. I looked out the window and there was glass and debris scattered all over the street, but no fire yet,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bedwell </PERSON>, 24, who lived in a second-story apartment over the paint store. `` I opened the window and some people were shouting to me. I just jumped and they caught me,'' said <PERSON> Bedwell </PERSON>, who was clad only in his underwear. <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON> <PERSON> Boatman </PERSON>, who was at a bar a block and a half from the explosion, said several patrons left and began shouting outside the windows to awaken people in the neighborhood. She said several people joined to catch residents who jumped when the building began collapsing. `` People that were in the building, some of them on the third floor, they said they felt the building drop,'' said Deputy Fire Chief <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>. `` The north wall dropped out and they jumped to their safety.'' One woman was in fair condition with a spinal injury suffered when she jumped from a second-story window, according to <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinzer </PERSON> Eleven others, including five firefighters and one police officer, were treated for minor injuries and released, <PERSON> Pinzer </PERSON> said. `` It was very fortunate. They must have had a friend upstairs,'' said <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>. Ten people were evacuated from the building that collapsed and numerous others were evacuated from their dwellings in the neighborhood, said Police Lt. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Domagaleski </PERSON> said. The fire was still smoldering early today, and authorities said it would be some time before investigators determined the cause. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said a crane would be used to pull the wreckage apart Tuesday. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, a fire battalion chief, said at least 150 firefighters were called to fight the blaze, which began after 11 p.m. Sunday and was brought under control about 2 a.m. today. The fire spread to at least two multifamily houses and <ORGANIZATION> Century </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION>, a 100-year-old tavern. Other buildings suffered some fire and water damage. `` As we hear it, it's shot, but no one got hurt and that's what's OK,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sidoff </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bayside </LOCATION>, the owner of Century Hall <PERSON> Sidoff </PERSON> said the three-story structure was entirely gutted by the fire, including the hall's own on-site brewery. <PERSON> Sidoff </PERSON>, who has owned the building for six years, said it had been used as a bowling alley, pool hall, bar and brewery during its 100-year history. The building also contained office space and a ballroom.

 The pilot of a supersonic attack jet underwent surgery today for critical injuries suffered when his plane crashed during a performance at the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> here, a hospital official said. Col. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cadick </PERSON>, 45, of <LOCATION> Evansville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, was performing a loop maneuver Sunday when the F-A-18 Hornet crashed in front of a crowd of 150,000, said Cpl. <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON>. None of the thousands of spectators was injured, but the air show was immediately canceled. <PERSON> Cadick </PERSON> underwent surgery early today at <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in nearby <LOCATION> Mission </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Viejo </LOCATION> and remained in critical condition with multiple injuries, said nursing supervisor <PERSON> Sonsee </PERSON> <PERSON> Bremner </PERSON>. The jet crashed but did not explode in a grassy area separating a taxi way and a runway about 1,000 yards from the audience watching the 38th annual <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relief </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> Show, said Lt. <PERSON> Shawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>. The jet was n't part of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angels </ORGANIZATION> precision flying team, which performed before the crash. `` The jet crashed in between a taxi way and a runway in the middle of the field,'' she said. The accident occurred about midway through the show. `` The aircraft itself did not burn,'' said Gunnery Sgt. <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cauley </PERSON>. `` There was some fire there from the afterburners, but that was in the grassy area and it was immediately extinguished.'' Witness J.L. <PERSON> Eppstein </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION> police officer, was directing traffic when the jet crashed. `` He came in low and kind of stalled. It was like he could n't get it going,'' <PERSON> Eppstein </PERSON> said `` The tail hit the ground. He slid for a ways and then hit a dirt mound. When he stalled, it was like getting your car stuck in the mud.'' <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyszka </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Covina </LOCATION> also witnessed the impact. `` We saw it hit the ground,'' he said. `` It looked like it lost power. His nose was up and then all I saw was dust.'' The F-A-18 is a twin-engine fighter-bomber flown by both <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> pilots. The crash was the final blow to this year's planned two-day event. Saturday's opening festivities were canceled when a rainstorm swept through <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The show is put on each year to aid the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relief </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, which allocates grants, provides interest-free loans and other services to <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> personnel and their families. `` An investigation will be conducted to determine the cause -LRB- of the crash -RRB-,'' Staff Sgt. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Short </PERSON> said. It was the second major accident in three years at the yearly show in this city about 50 miles southeast of downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. On April 27, 1985, pilot Merrel <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gossman </PERSON>, 55, of <LOCATION> Canoga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> pilot who was demonstrating a vintage trainer plane, and passenger <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Arrowsmith </PERSON>, 25, a civilian stationed at the <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Toro </LOCATION> station's medical clinic, were killed when the World War II plane they were flying crashed into an empty church on base.

 Police and worshippers who watched in horror as a man set himself on fire during an evening church service remain puzzled over why he soaked his clothing in gasoline, then walked down the aisle in flames. <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> Macon </LOCATION> died Sunday morning, about eight hours after he torched himself at the <ORGANIZATION> Friendship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. He suffered burns over all of his body, said <LOCATION> Bibb </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Deputy Coroner <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Fain </PERSON>. <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> died at Medical Center of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. The Rev. <PERSON> J.L </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>, pastor of the church, helped extinguish the fire and told <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> to go back outside and get some air. There was a lot of smoke in the church from the fire, and <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> said it was making it difficult to breathe. `` He got up nice and easy, went out to the front and collapsed,'' <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> said. The pastor said that <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> never hollered or cried _ he only muttered, `` It's all right.'' Police said they found an antifreeze container that apparently held gasoline which <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> used to douse himself before lighting the fire. <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> said a musical program was almost over when `` I saw the children looking curious and I looked back'' from the first row. `` I saw this young man coming up the middle aisle ablaze of fire,'' <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> said. Many in the church became hysterical, the pastor said. He added that <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> was a stranger to the 40 to 50 people in the church sanctuary. Police Capt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> said investigators were continuing to check into <PERSON> Boone </PERSON>'s background Sunday, but had not come up with any possible explanation for his actions.

 Investigators say it could be days before they determine the cause of the explosions that killed five workers and reduced a grain elevator complex to rubble. `` The cause is still undetermined,'' <LOCATION> Joliet </LOCATION> Fire Chief <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Plese </PERSON> said of the blasts Friday at the <ORGANIZATION> ADM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Growmark </ORGANIZATION> granary on the banks of the <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plaines </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Rescue workers labored for 29 hours in search of three of the victims, whose bodies were recovered Saturday, he said. The state fire marshal's office and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> are investigating the two explosions, <PERSON> Plese </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Burket </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Archer-Daniel-Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said late Sunday the company's insurance and safety people also have an investigation under way. Plese said <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> impounded much of the structural steel from the four silos destroyed by the blast. The last three of the five victims were found crumpled in the basement of the granary, crushed by the wave of corn and soybeans that swept them there, the chief said. They were identified as <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zack </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Joliet </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON>, 18, of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dupuis </PERSON>, 23, of <PERSON> Bourbonnais </PERSON>, said <LOCATION> Will </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Deputy Coroner <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON>. `` As far as I can tell from the preliminary examinations at the scene there was no burning on these bodies,'' <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON> said Saturday. `` Indications are that they would have died instantly from the injuries.'' The bodies of <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, 20, of <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Slatton </PERSON>, 28, of <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, were found Friday. Officials ruled out a witness' report that the blasts blew a worker off a barge and into the river, and a search of the river was called off, <PERSON> Plese </PERSON> said. `` This is just one of those tragic things that should never happen,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, whose son was killed. For the <PERSON> Slatton </PERSON> family, the loss came on the heels of another son's death in an auto accident less than a year ago. `` It's totally devastating to have three sons and to lose two,'' said the victim's mother, <PERSON> Carol </PERSON>. Three other people, including the elevator's manager and assistant manager, were injured in the blasts. Only one, trucker <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Rayburn </PERSON>, remained hospitalized Sunday. <PERSON> Rayburn </PERSON>, who was pinned in his truck for 40 minutes when it was buried with debris, was in fair condition at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joseph </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Joliet </LOCATION>, said nursing supervisor <PERSON> Ida </PERSON> <PERSON> Dercoli </PERSON>. The blasts turned the 100-foot silos into mounds of twisted steel, reinforced concrete and 70,000 bushels of corn and soybeans, <PERSON> Plese </PERSON> said. `` We had to dig through all of that to get at these people who were buried,'' he said by phone Sunday from <LOCATION> Joliet </LOCATION>. Local construction trade unions, trucking and wrecking companies and nearby fire departments volunteered in the rescue effort, <PERSON> Plese </PERSON> said.

 Former Vice President <PERSON> Spiro </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON> lost a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> appeal today in a lawsuit alleging he was cheated out of more than $ 2 million for arranging a deal between a defense contractor and the Argentine government. The justices, without comment, refused to order the setting aside of more than $ 340,000 in a special fund <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON> and another businessman would receive if they win the lawsuit. <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON>, an international business consultant, charged in a 1986 suit filed in federal court in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> that he was cheated out of a commission he earned for winning a telecommunications contract for <ORGANIZATION> Aydin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Aydin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Alicanto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.A. </ORGANIZATION>, an Argentine company, retained him to help open doors in 1980 with the Argentine ruling military junta. His suit said <PERSON> Alicanto </PERSON> was to recieve a 15 percent commission from <PERSON> Aydin </PERSON> and then pay <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON> between one-third and one-half that amount, more than $ 2 million. But <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON> alleged that Alicanto instead paid a $ 3.65 million bribe to a `` bagman'' who passed it on to <ORGANIZATION> Argentine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Gen. <PERSON> Lami </PERSON> <PERSON> Dozo </PERSON> to help win the contract. <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON> said <PERSON> Alicanto </PERSON> then lied to him, claiming the deal fell through when in fact <PERSON> Aydin </PERSON> won a $ 57 million contract to provide a microwave communications system to the Argentine <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Woolverton </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a former vice president of <LOCATION> Alicanto </LOCATION>, are suing <PERSON> Alicanto </PERSON> and its president, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> last year refused to order Alicanto and <ORGANIZATION> Shaw </ORGANIZATION> to place more than $ 340,000 in a fund that would go to <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON> and <PERSON> Woolverton </PERSON> if they win their suit. In their appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON> and <PERSON> Woolverton </PERSON> said <PERSON> Alicanto </PERSON>'s assets now may be `` moved out of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and most likely out of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'' so that they will be out of reach of any court judgment. <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON>, elected vice president in 1968 when <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> headed the Republican ticket, resigned in 1973 after he was accused of accepting bribes and kickbacks while a <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> executive in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. He pleaded no contest to tax evasion in that case. <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON> said in his suit against <PERSON> Alicanto </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> that he was cheated out of the commission by people who believed his past reputation would bar him from winning any case in court. <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON> said he was told by a lawyer who worked for <PERSON> Aydin </PERSON> that `` nobody would believe him if he sued -LRB- because of -RRB- prior events related to his holding public office.'' The case is <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON> vs. Alicanto, 87-1464.

<HEAD>Wardens Count Fish Speared on Water, Boat Landing Tension Rises</HEAD>

 Tensions over Indian fishing rights rose as about 60 protesters carrying signs and an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag harassed <LOCATION> Chippewa </LOCATION> spearfishers on a northern <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> lake. `` If they -LRB- spearfishing opponents -RRB- keep up what they're doing, they're going to have spears in them,'' <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Maulson </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Lac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> du </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Flambeau </LOCATION> tribal judge and spearfishing organizer, said Sunday. A Department of Natural Resources official said the tension at <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arbor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vitae </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> was increased by the presence of a Republican congressional candidate. The candidate, <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hermening </PERSON>, said the controversy is an issue of citizenship. `` We ca n't have separate rights for special groups of people based on age, gender or race,'' Hermening told the cheering protesters Sunday night. The Indians' right to spearfish in off-reservation lakes has been upheld in federal court, but protesters say the fishing damages stocks and hurts sportfishing, a major industry here. The crowd traded verbal jabs with Indians and wardens from the Great Lakes Indian Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> took a boat out on the water to count, measure and record the sex of fish rather than face possible confrontation when they were brought to shore. Counting fish on the water `` may well avoid another time of a possible confrontation,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> DNR </ORGANIZATION> chief administrator of enforcement. He said spearfishing opponents become more upset and vocal when fish are counted. State wardens planned to cite one of about 15 non-Indian boats on the lake with causing a hazardous wake, said <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>. Officials also were considering whether to cite the boater with harassment. No one was injured in the incident, <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> said. An Indian report of a gunshot heard on <LOCATION> Catfish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Vilas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> was turned over to the county Sheriff's Department for investigation, said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Urso </PERSON>, DNR north-central district director. This was the fourth year the <LOCATION> Chippewa </LOCATION> have exercised their right, retained in 19th century treaties, to harvest resources in northern <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> lands ceded to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Protests have been violent in previous years, including shots fired at some lakes in 1986. No serious injuries have been reported, and a cadre of officers aided by a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> chopper is helping keep the peace this year. Each Indian band is allowed 15 days of spearing and may take no more than 20 percent of what biologists figure a lake's fish population can tolerate. The season ends May 6. The Indians fish at night, using lanterns to help them find fish, which they catch with spears up to eight feet long. Protesters say this is an unfair way to fish. <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> attributed the number of non-Indian boats on <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arbor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vitae </ORGANIZATION> and some of the tension to the organized protest and Hermening's presence. He said there was a `` marked difference'' in the tension after <PERSON> Hermening </PERSON> returned from a boat ride to address the crowd. `` His presence ... increased the size of the crowd and in particular, some of his discussion after the boat came back in, in my mind, did increase some of the tension,'' <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Soviets Report Industrial Production Increases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soviet industrial production increased by 5 percent in the first three months of 1988 as reforms requiring many factories and firms to operate on a self-sustaining basis went into effect, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> said today. The official radio said <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Belov </PERSON>, deputy head of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>, reported the production increase exceeded the 4.5 percent target set in state plans. However, it said `` production targets have not been met as regards a number of major commodities, and the quality of many of the goods is still substandard.'' The brief report did not specify the problem areas of the economy, or areas of success. It said the national income increased by 4 percent. National income is a measurement of economic activity that differs from gross national product in not considering the value of some services. As of Jan. 1, state-run factories and farms responsible for 60 percent of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s production were required to depend on themselves for the revenue they need to operate. That is one of the key elements of <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s economic reforms, which are aimed at giving local managers more responsibility and flexibility The Communist Party general secretary wants to limit central authorities to overall planning of the economy rather than exercising direct control over the production plans and quotas of factories and farms. Industries and farms operating under the new requirements `` are performing better than those working in the old way,'' <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> said. The radio report came as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence agencies in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> released a report saying <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms ran into serious obstacles in 1987. A joint report by the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the Soviet gross national product increased only 0.5 percent in 1987, compared with a 3.9 percent increase the previous year. It cited the poor performance in 1987 to poor weather that hurt farm production and resistance to change in the Soviet bureaucracy.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to consider giving federal prison wardens more power to decide what publications inmates may read. The court said it will review a ruling that limits the authority of officials to censor reading material behind prison bars. One of the prisoners in the case is <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON>, a convicted murderer and bank robber who achieved notoriety after he was befriended by <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Mailer </PERSON> and other prominent writers and editors. Six weeks after <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON> was freed in a work-release program in 1981, he stabbed to death an aspiring actor outside of a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> restaurant where the victim was working as a waiter. <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON>'s book on prison life, `` In the Belly of the <LOCATION> Beast </LOCATION>,'' was critically acclaimed <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON> is among prisoners who challenged federal regulations restricting publications that may be sent to inmates. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> here ruled last July that the rules go too far in giving wardens control over what publications inmates may subscribe to or receive. The appeals court ordered further trial court hearings, where officials will have to prove that 46 publications should be banned because they threaten security, order or rehabilitation. The free-expression rights of inmates require that officials shoulder the burden of proof when they seek to ban publications, the appeals court said. Among the publications officials tried to ban were, for example, an issue of The Call, a left-wing newspaper that included an article charging `` inhumane treatment ... by racist guards'' in federal prisons. Officials at a federal penitentiary in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> said the article `` is considered not to be in the best interest of discipline, good order and security.'' But the appeals court said that is an insufficient reason to ban the publication. The officials failed to prove `` the material encouraged conduct which would constitute, or otherwise was likely to produce, a breach of security or order or an impairment of rehabilitation.'' The same limits on official power should apply to sexually explicit material, the appeals court said. Also, the appeals court said censoring parts of a publication is less restrictive than banning the newspaper or magazine entirely. `` Rejecting an entire publication where a part is objectionable is inconsistent with the First Amendment,'' the appeals court said. The Constitution's First Amendment ensures freedom of speech. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration urged the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to restore fully the prison regulations. `` While a warden may have a legitimate fear that a particular publication will cause problems, he will rarely be able to prove a likelihood of violence or disorder as a result of the admission of a publication,'' <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers said. They cited uprisings last year by inmates from <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> in two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prisons as evidence `` that information from the outside can, in some circumstances, have grave consequences within a prison.'' The government also argued that the number of publications excluded is small. Between Sept. 1, 1986 and Aug. 31, 1987 some 1,728 publications were withheld out of 1.8 million sent to federal inmates, the government's appeal said. The groups challenging the prison regulations are the Prisoners' Union, <ORGANIZATION> Weekly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guardian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> The case is <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON>, 87-1344.

 <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> administrators resumed talks today with protesters who are occupying a dean's office and demanding more attention to the education of racial minorities Talks began at 7 a.m., barely six hours after negotiators broke from a previous meeting, college spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolesar </PERSON> said. The two sides had met for two hours Sunday afternoon, with <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> taking part, then reconvened at 9:15 p.m. and talked into the early morning hours. Representatives of both sides called the Sunday talks `` constructive.'' The students, members of a group called the <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Racist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, took over the <ORGANIZATION> Jenness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Friday morning and issued 13 demands that included the hiring by the prestigious liberal arts school of more minority faculty members and the admitting of more minority students, while incorporating more minority perspectives into the curriculum. `` They're responsive to us,'' said one of the student negotiators, <PERSON> Monique </PERSON> <PERSON> Waddell </PERSON>, 19, a sophomore from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, referring to the administration representatives that included <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Fix </PERSON> and Provost <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Grabois </PERSON>. `` The meeting is showing some progress,'' she said. `` There's not a sense of negativity The energy that is flowing is constructive, so that's good.'' She added, `` It's just a matter of getting them to understand us better.'' The talks were conducted in the physics building, adjacent to the <ORGANIZATION> Jenness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. Minority students comprise 13 percent of the 2,000-member student body. The protesters include students from <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> islands as well as <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> blacks and Hispanics. About 10 percent of the 278-member faculty belongs to a minority group. Sunday, administration officials and the protesters discussed three of the demands. These were: establishing full scholarships for low-income minority students from urban areas; creating a campus cultural center for minority groups, and hiring a special assistant to the president to recruit more minority teachers. School spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolesar </PERSON> said the administration would not comment specifically on the talks but he called the discussions `` constructive.'' While the negotiations were under way, a young white man was seen taping a sign saying `` Quality, Not Quotas'' on a window at <PERSON> Jenness </PERSON>, with the words facing inside the house. It was later removed. Freshman <PERSON> Jillian </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, who spent Saturday night inside the house, said she heard rocks being thrown at the building. <ORGANIZATION> Jenness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, which serves as the dean's office while the main administration building is being renovated, is tucked in a corner of the campus, making the protest less conspicuous. While some of the hundreds of parents visiting over the Parents' Weekend expressed concern and even support for the protest, they largely spent the weekend undisturbed by it, said <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Berek </PERSON>, news director for the school.

<HEAD>Court Lets Stand Ruling on Property Owners' Rights in Wyoming Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today let stand a ruling that property owners' rights are not violated when they are required to remove structures that could interfere with low-flying planes. The court, citing the lack of a `` substantial federal question,'' rejected an appeal by a <LOCATION> Cheyenne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, man fined $ 200 a day for refusing to trim a 48-foot cottowood tree on his property. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, the tree owner, said a <LOCATION> Cheyenne </LOCATION> ordinance imposing a height limit on structures near the local airport is unconstitutional because it takes property without just compensation. His tree, at 48 feet, would have to be cut to 25 or 30 feet to comply with the ordinance. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said that would kill the tree, costing him $ 2,064. After he lost an earlier challenge to the ordinance's constitutionality, <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> was found guilty of violating city law and fined $ 200 a day beginning Nov. 20, 1986 Court documents did not indicate the total fine assessed against <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Wyoming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last December upheld the fine, rejecting claims that the air space above <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION>' property belonged to him. The state court also rejected <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>' argument that because the tree was in place prior to enactment of the ordinance he was entitled to keep it. The state court said the local law `` allows for the continuance of a non-conforming use. It does not allow the expansion of a pre-existing non-conforming use.'' `` In other words,'' the state court said, `` a violation occurred if the tree was allowed to grow higher than it stood in October 1974 when the ordinance was adopted.'' The tree has grown some 18 feet since the fall of 1974, the state court said. The justices in 1986 rejected a related appeal by <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>. The case is <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> vs. <LOCATION> Cheyenne </LOCATION>, 87-1462.

<HEAD>Court Turns Away Missouri Sex Discrimination Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today turned away a case in which <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> officials were found guilty of sex discrimination by not hiring enough women as highway maintenance workers. The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by state officials who said lower courts improperly weighed the evidence. The justices also refused to hear an appeal by women who said remedies ordered by the lower courts were inadequate. The 8th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> last September said there was adequate evidence for a federal jury to find that the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> discriminated against women in the state's eighth district. The verdict was based partly on anecdotal evidence and partly on statistics that showed the number of women maintenance workers in the district was a small fraction of the women in the regional work force. The appeals court said that from Jan. 1, 1975, through May 31, 1980, the state hired eight women as maintenance workers and 89 men for those jobs. During that period women comprised up to 48 percent of the work force, the appeals court noted. <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> officials interpreted the statistics differently. They said only 312 women applied for maintenance work compared to 3,566 men during that period. The state said it hired 2.6 percent of the female applicants and 2.5 percent of the men who applied. But the 8th Circuit court said the equal hiring rate did not prove the state was innocent of bias. A judge and jury `` were free to weigh the inference of non-discrimination arising from the hiring rate against the inference of discrimination arising from the anecdotal and statistical evidence,'' the appeals court said. It added the evidence was sufficient to support a verdict that the state `` engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination against women.'' The appeals court upheld a ruling that some 150 women may share in back pay to be awarded by the state. The group is made up of women who were qualified to be hired as maintenance workers if the state had not discriminated on the basis of sex. But the appeals court overturned a portion of a federal judge's ruling that <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> hire from 37 percent to 48 percent women for future maintenance worker openings The 8th Circuit court ordered the hiring goal `` replaced by a generalized injunction prohibitng further discrimination'' against women. The appeals court also refused to order the state to hire four women who were among the first to charge the state with discrimination, and it declined to extend its ruling beyond the eighth district to make it statewide. The <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a conservative group, and officials from <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> said the finding of discrimination against <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> could have far-reaching consequences. They said the charges were based on questionable statistical evidence. The eligible work force consisted of all working women between ages 18 and 70 who had driver's licenses and an eighth grade education, they noted. `` This labor pool is too broad because it failed to consider only those individuals willing and able to do the work in question,'' they said. The cases are <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Catlett </PERSON>, 87-1415, and <PERSON> Catlett </PERSON> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, 87-1416.

 An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> court today sentenced <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> to be executed for war crimes committed as `` <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> the Terrible,'' a sadistic <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> guard who ran gas chambers where about 800,000 Jews died. `` He was a chief hangman who with his own hands killed tens of thousands with cruelty ... We sentence him to death,'' said Judge <PERSON> Zvi </PERSON> <PERSON> Tal </PERSON>. Onlookers clapped and shouted as the sentence was announced. Some chanted `` Bravo.'' Others shouted: `` Death, death.'' Last week, the court convicted the 68-year-old retired <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> autoworker of Nazi war crimes. It said he was responsible for the deaths of thousands of Jews at the <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION> concentration camp in Nazi-occupied <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. About 800,000 Jews died in 1942 and 1943, when `` Ivan'' worked at the camp. Only one man has ever been executed in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 40-year history. <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Eichmann </PERSON>, architect of the Holocaust, was hanged in 1962. Court Spokesman <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> would most likely be hanged. `` If the sentence is upheld on appeal, the expectation is he would be hanged,'' <PERSON> Hassin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> attended today's sentences in a wheelchair, complaining of back problems. He entered the courtroom moments before the verdict was read, shouting in Hebrew: `` I am innocent.'' A Christian, he was seen making the sign of the cross and whispering to himself, apparently praying, during arguments from prosecutors who demanded the death penalty. After the verdict he was wheeled away, expressionless and ringed by riot police. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s lawyers have said they will appeal his conviction to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Today's sentence followed a trial that lasted 14 months. <PERSON> Yosef </PERSON> <PERSON> Czarny </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION> survivor who testified against <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>, said that although `` a thousand deaths can not compensate for what happened ... at least we have judged one of the Angels of Death.'' `` I feel like a burden has been lifted,'' said <PERSON> Pinchas </PERSON> <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON>, another Holocaust survivor. Tal's statement after three hours of judicial deliberation drew applause and whistling from hundreds of Israelis in the audience, including survivors of the Holocaust. Several hundred onlookers crowded into the converted movie theater to hear the verdict. Earlier, longtime observers said they expected the death penalty because of the sweeping guilty verdict which discounted each defense argument. `` There is no forgiveness in the law or the heart ... -LRB- Holocaust -RRB- victims are still crying out to us,'' said <PERSON> Tal </PERSON>, who was born in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. `` Even a thousand deaths can not compensate.'' <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s son, 22-year-old <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, said his family had expected a death sentence. `` It amounts to nothing less than the judicial murder of an innocent man,'' he said. `` It will bring shame to the state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the Israeli <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, and most unfortunately the six million victims of the Nazi Holocaust.'' Earlier in the day, his father told the three-judge panel it was making a `` very, very, very big mistake.'' The Ukrainian-born <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> has consistently alleged he is a victim of mistaken identity, although he admitted lying on his American emigration papers about his past. He contends he was held in a Nazi prisoner of war camp during the critical period in question. `` I am not <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> the Terrible, and to that God is the most just witness. He knows I am innocent,'' <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> told the court today. He spoke in Ukrainian. The court adjourned briefly after <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> spoke to allow the judges time to consider the arguments. The defense also had pleaded against a death sentence. `` There is also a question of an individual's holocaust,'' said defense attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. `` The taking of any innocent human life is a holocaust.'' Opening the proceedings today, prosecutor <PERSON> Yona </PERSON> <PERSON> Blattman </PERSON> told the three judges that <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> `` was not a small cog in the Nazi machine, he was a major criminal, an arch-henchman.'' `` We maintain the only punishment that can be imposed on the accused is the death penalty,'' <PERSON> Blattman </PERSON> argued. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> pointed to his chest, shaking his head no, as <PERSON> Blattman </PERSON> alleged that <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> had `` distinguished himself by the sheer brutality of his behavior ... beating Jews mercilessly with a sword or whip.'' <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> said the conviction could be shown at a later date to have been incorrect and he cited previous wrongful convictions. The problem with the death penalty, he said, is that it `` is in fact irrevocable.'' In its verdict last week, the tribunal convicted <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> `` without hesitation or doubt'' of being the brutal guard at <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION>. The three judges said <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> `` killed masses of human beings with his own hands,'' frequently exceeding the brutality ordered by <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> commanders. Nazi war crimes and terrorism are the only offenses punishable by death in the Jewish state. During the trial, five Holocaust survivors identified <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>, of suburban <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, as the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> guard who operated <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION>'s gas chambers Justice Minister <PERSON> Avraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharir </PERSON> had urged the death penalty for <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>, saying `` a man convicted of such terrible crimes deserves no other sentence.''

 President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> today met <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> at the presidential palace, only the second time the Arab leaders have come face-to-face since <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was expelled from <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> five years ago. Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Jibran </PERSON> <PERSON> Kourieh </PERSON> said <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> began meeting at 5 p.m. -LRB- 10 a.m. EDT -RRB- at <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>'s Mohajirine palace. The session follows the assassination of <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s top deputy _ <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON> _ and was seen as a step toward a reconciliation between <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> last met at the Arab summit last November in <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> chief was accompanied to today's meeting by seven senior aides, <PERSON> Kourieh </PERSON> said. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Farouk </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Sharaa </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> also attended the meeting, the presidential spokesman said. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> earlier met with other <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leaders to prepare for the crucial session with <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Habash </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Marxist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION>, said that three-hour meeting `` touched on all issues'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> would discuss with <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> on Sunday. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was accompanied by Col. <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Kharroubi </PERSON>, a senior aide to <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s official media reported <PERSON> Kharroubi </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> today, but gave no details. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Hadli </PERSON> <PERSON> Benjedid </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> had accelerated efforts to reconcile <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> after <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON> was assassinated in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> on April 16, apparently by an Israeli commando unit. <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>, 52, was buried in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> last Wednesday. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, his long-time comrade and co-founder of the guerrilla movement, did not attend because of his feud with <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>. A reconciliation between <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>, two of the key figures in the Arab conflict with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, would do much to forge <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> unity. <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders have been trying for years to get <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> to make up their differences. While <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>'s assassination was a severe blow to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, most <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders believe it has accelerated efforts to reconcile <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. In addition to <PERSON> Habash </PERSON>, today's <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> meeting at the <LOCATION> Rawda </LOCATION> guest palace included <PERSON> Nayef </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawatmeh </PERSON>, secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the Liberation of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Suleiman </PERSON> <PERSON> Najjab </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestinian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Salah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalaf </PERSON>, the No. 2 man in <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION>, the largest <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> faction. <PERSON> Hawatmeh </PERSON> told reporters that `` we all agreed that this a rare opportunity'' for reconciliation with <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, which expelled <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> in June 1983 amid a mutiny within the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> inspired by <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>. He said there was a `` unanimous belief'' among the Palestinians that `` this opportunity would lead to the restoration of warm relations between <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'' and bolster the 4 -LCB- - month-old Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON> was popular with both <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> loyalists and pro-Syrian dissidents. Palestinian factions, divided since the PLO-Syrian rift, all denounced his killing and vowed revenge. <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>, known as <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jihad </PERSON>, was the apparent mastermind of the Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied territories.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> is organizing and helping finance an umbrella organization to give financial assistance to AIDS patients and their families, a newspaper reports. The foundation, the nation's wealthiest, was expected to announce today the formation of the National-Community AIDS Partnership, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said. The partnership is designed to pool the resources of the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, corporate donors and other philanthropies to help local organizations across the country provide housing, day care, counseling, and education for victims of acquired immune deficiency syndrome and their families. The announcement was expected at the annual conference of the Council on Foundations, which opens today in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, the newspaper said. In addition to providing funds, the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> hopes that its own status will attract organizations and corporations that have been reluctant to become involved in AIDS funding. <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> <PERSON> Forman </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> director, acknowledged that major foundations have been slow to respond to the AIDS crisis. `` I feel we all should have been there with an appropriate response five years ago but we were not,'' he said. `` We're there now and the question is how do we get others to join us.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> will make an initial contribution of $ 2 million to the partnership. Smaller sums will be contributed by other philanthropies in the partnership, including the <ORGANIZATION> Kaiser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, $ 200,000; the <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundations </ORGANIZATION>, $ 100,000 each; and the <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Aetna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casualty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, $ 50,000 each annually for two years. The partnership will be administered by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AIDS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> group which helps 450 community-based AIDS organizations. Community foundations in nine regions have agreed to raise from $ 100,000 to $ 500,000 to match contributions made by the national partners for a total of about $ 8 million. More community groups are expected to join the partnership later this year. The nine regions are the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> area; southern and northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>; the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Six Arrested At Rocky Flats Nuclear Protest Reunion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Six activists were arrested for blocking a railroad track at the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant during a reunion of protesters who were at a massive demonstration 10 years ago. `` There was n't any planned civil disobedience. It was all spontaneous,'' activist <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Klaver </PERSON> said of Sunday's protest. `` The attitude of the police had a lot to do with it. They were so rigid.'' The demonstrators marched 10 miles from <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION> to Rocky Flats, where about 150 people who gathered on the tracks for then, pitched tents and danced the `` Hokey Pokey.'' Many had participated in protests that began A 10-year reuniopril 29, 1978, when dozens were arrested. Longtime peace activist <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellsberg </PERSON> told the small reunion Sunday the militaristic `` cold war'' mentality that made <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> president eight years ago is receding before a resurgence of pacifism. The plant, 16 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, makes plutonium triggers for nuclear weapons. It is operated by <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>. The protesters were ordered to leave five times Sunday by a guard. Most backed away from the tracks, but the six continued to chant and dance. `` Most people do not support nuclear weapons,'' one activist shouted at the guards. `` You have no right to be here. You're participating in murder.' `` I'd never done anything like that before. We really got to know each other because of our common cause. We were very supportive and loving.'' <PERSON> Dorskind </PERSON> said he is not as impulsive today as he was then. `` I'm much more careful about the decisions I make I'm not ready to turn my head so fast, just because somebody gives a liberal rap.''

<TEXT>
 A young man wearing gang colors was shot to death by a man wearing a rival gang's insignia while waiting in line to see `` Colors,'' the first fatality linked to the much criticized movie about out-of-control street gangs. Police were seeking the suspect, a man in his 20s, who fatally shot the 19-year-old victim Sunday afternoon while he stood in line at a cinema in this community east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. The movie depicts the rival Los Angeles-based Crips and Bloods gangs. The suspect was wearing a red handkerchief, as do members of the Bloods, while the victim had on a blue handkerchief, signifying the Crips, authorities said. The bullet hit a 17-year-old girl after it passed through the victim's head, but she was not seriously injured, said <PERSON> Stockton </PERSON> Police Lt. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Swim </PERSON>. `` Colors'' opened nationwide April 15 at 425 theaters amid protests and tight security following predictions of audience violence. In <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, arrests were made after minor scuffles at two theaters on the film's opening night. And in <LOCATION> Colma </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, police ordered a downtown theater to stop showing the movie because crowds nearly got out of hand opening night. Sunday's incident began when the victim was standing in line with his brother-in-law and girlfriend, said <PERSON> Swim </PERSON>, reading a statement. The suspect and at least two male companions drove by the theater, then returned and parked, said Swim. The suspect got out and approached the victim and asked, `` Are you a ricket?'' Swim said ricket is a derogatory term for Crips members. <PERSON> Swim </PERSON> said the victim's girlfriend stepped between the two and told the suspect they did not want any trouble. The suspect then turned toward the car when his two companions began fighting with the victim's brother-in-law. As the victim went to the aid of his brother-in-law, the suspect returned and pointed a gun at him, said Swim. The victim began to run, but the suspect fired one shot that hit the victim in the head. `` Colors,'' starring <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvall </PERSON>, opened to large crowds at many theaters April 15, but little of the anticipated violence materialized. The Guardian Angels, the self-styled citizen crime-fighters, were among those claiming the film glorified gangs and would prompt violence. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>, the film's distributor, recently defended the movie. `` If there is anything this picture does not do, it does not glorify gangs or gang violence.'' <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> said. Authorities have kept a presence at theaters in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and other places with known gangs during screening of the movie. In <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, three people were killed over the weekend in gang-related attacks not connected to the movie, including an alleged gang member who was killed Sunday after he shot a sheriff's deputy in the back The <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's deputy was saved by a bulletproof vest, said Deputy <PERSON> Roxanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Schuchman </PERSON>. The deputy then returned fire and killed the alleged gang member, whose name was not released. In other gang violence, a 17-year-old man was stabbed to death Friday night and another man was fatally wounded in a drive-by shooting early Saturday, police said.

<TEXT>
 Church officials turned away a woman and her troubled 9-year-old son from services at an Episcopal church, enforcing a court order barring them because of the boy's disruptive behavior `` This is God's church, not your church,'' <PERSON> Sheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Geartz </PERSON> quietly told the half-dozen men who blocked the door Sunday at Grace Episcopal Cathedral. Ms. <PERSON> Geartz </PERSON> prayed aloud before leaving: `` Dear Lord, we know this is your house. We ask you to open your doors to let us in. In <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>' name, we pray.'' She then took her son and 7-year-old daughter to another church. The cathedral had obtained a restraining order in <LOCATION> Shawnee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION> last week that barred her and her son <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> on the grounds that the boy disrupts services and his mother will not control him. The church's petition for a restraining order described <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>'s `` disruptive and dangerous activities,'' such as pulling the fire alarm, making loud noises, throwing objects and destroying property Ms. <PERSON> Geartz </PERSON> admits that <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> has misbehaved, but she says he has emotional problems and that taking him to church every week has improved his conduct. The dean of Grace Cathedral, the Very Rev. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shahan </PERSON>, said at a news conference later Sunday that the church worked with Ms. <PERSON> Geartz </PERSON> for seven months to try to restrain <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>. `` The level of disturbance moved from being merely annoying to being utterly intolerable,'' said <PERSON> Shahan </PERSON>. Some church members stopped attending services or stopped taking communion because of the disruptions, <PERSON> Shahan </PERSON> said. `` We were faced with a situation in which one person had determined her needs were paramount to the needs of the entire congregation,'' he said. `` Our duty, as we see it, must be to the congregation as a whole.'' Church officials were unable to find a solution Ms. <PERSON> Geartz </PERSON> would accept to control the boy, <PERSON> Shahan </PERSON> said. The dean, the head clergyman of the cathedral, said he expected criticism from people who would ask, `` Is getting a restraining order what a loving, caring Christian community does?'' `` The answer is, this is what a loving, caring Christian community does, after seven months of trying to help, to no avail,'' he said. Ms. <PERSON> Geartz </PERSON> said she was aware that she was under court order not to appear at Grace Cathedral, but she said she went to take a stand for people who are emotionally disturbed. `` Where will it stop?'' she said. `` If they ban my son from this church, are they going to ban other children and even adults who have emotional problems?'' Ms. <PERSON> Geartz </PERSON> said she would pray before deciding whether to attempt to attend services next week.

 An African gray parrot alerted her owner by calling out his name when a Teflon-coated pan caught fire, but died from the fumes after the fire was extinguished. A veterinarian said burning <PERSON> Teflon </PERSON> has been found to cause respiratory arrest in birds. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> student, said 7-year-old <PERSON> Coco </PERSON> died exactly one year after his mother, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> <PERSON> Givens </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION>, gave him the bird as a birthday present. <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, 21, who shares a house with five other students in <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>, said one roommate arrived home early Saturday and put a pot of water on the stove to make spaghetti. <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> said the roommate went to his room and made a telephone call, then fell asleep while the water boiled away. <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> said about 4:30 a.m. he heard Coco screeching in the living room, next to the kitchen, and then calling his name. He got up and found the kitchen was filled with smoke and the Teflon lining of the red-hot pot was aflame. <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> said he put out the fire and aired out the room, then checked on <PERSON> Coco </PERSON> and found that the bird appeared to be all right. But several minutes later, he said, he found the bird on the floor of her cage. Coco was valued at $ 1,000, could whistle the theme from the movie `` The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,'' and had a life expectancy of more than 100 years. `` This is really tragic,'' <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> said. `` I was going to put her into my will'' to provide for future care. Veterinarian <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dernell </PERSON> said <PERSON> Coco </PERSON>'s death is typical of other bird deaths involving Teflon cookware. He said an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> veterinarian has found that burning Teflon on cookware can release noxious fumes that cause respiratory arrest in birds. `` It does n't take much,'' <PERSON> Dernell </PERSON> said. `` In some cases no burning has to take place. If the Teflon gets hot enough, noxious fumes can be released and respiratory arrest -LRB- in birds -RRB- can occur.''

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is asking the government of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to give more money for the support of 43,000 American troops stationed there, an administration source said today. A team of <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials will officially raise the request in June at the next round of regularly scheduled talks with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, said the official. He asked not to be identified. `` We will be talking about increased direct support,'' he said. `` One reason we feel they should increase their contribution is their economic performance. The other is our own budget problems,'' he said. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has enjoyed an economic boom in recent years, with a record $ 9.78 billion account surplus last year. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s trade surplus with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> grew 39 percent in 1987. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> now contributes more than $ 100 million annually for the upkeep of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> force, said the official. In 1985, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> paid $ 34 million in direct funds for the upkeep of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces, said the official. It also contributed about $ 1 billion indirectly through tax and rent exemptions for the public lands used by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military, he said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is asking the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> government for an increase of $ 120 million, but the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> would be willing to give only $ 60 million more at most, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported today. The official refused to discuss those figures. Many South Koreans have been angered by reports of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> request, saying that although the trade figures favor their country, its residents are relatively poor by Western standards. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s per capita income is $ 3,000 annually, compared with about $ 17,500 in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials are also concerned that as <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> builds up its military strength it will no longer want <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> help to protect the country against <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. `` We must keep our troops there to counter the northern threat,'' said the American official. `` There's no doubt about that.'' Without <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops, the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> military is weaker than its northern neighbor, which enjoys the support of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.

 A passenger train today raced through a station where it was supposed to stop and then derailed. Danish television said seven people were killed and 67 injured. `` There are several overturned cars, partly on top of each other,'' Assistant Police Commissioner <PERSON> Palle </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasselgren </PERSON> told Danish radio. The radio reported the train, traveling from <LOCATION> Fredricia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Copenhagen </LOCATION>, derailed as it was to return to the main track from a side rail which was used because of repair work. The train was not scheduled to stop for passengers at the small rural station at <LOCATION> Soroe </LOCATION>, but was supposed to halt because of the track change. Instead it went through the station at high speed, the radio said. The engine and the two first cars flew off the track, causing the following five cars to overturn, the report said. The derailment occurred about 50 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Copenhagen </LOCATION>. The express train, with a capacity of 300 people, was nearly full. However, a group of children on their way to school got off at the station before <PERSON> Soroe </PERSON>, the radio said. Many passengers were businessmen from <LOCATION> Funen </LOCATION> island on their way to the Danish capital. Police helicopters and air force planes were called in to help evacuate casualties. The dead were not immediately identified. Their nationalities were not known.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said today it will consider overturning a key civil rights precedent allowing people to sue private citizens accused of racial discrimination. Four dissenting justices accused the court of undermining the trust minority groups have in it. The court, in an extraordinary move, said it will use a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> case involving charges of on-the-job racial harassment to consider throwing out a 12-year-old decision. In a strongly worded dissent, Justice <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said minority groups may feel betrayed by the court's order calling for re-examination of the 1976 case. `` In addition to the impact of today's decision on the faith of victims of racial discrimination in a stable construction of the civil rights laws, the order must also have a detrimental and enduring impact on the public's perception of the court as an impartial adjudicator,'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said. He also accused the five justices in the majority of indulging in unwise activism by agreeing to review an issue that was not raised by either side in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> case. `` If the court decides to cast itself adrift from the constraints imposed by the adversary process and to fashion its own agenda, the consequences for the nation _ and for the future of this court as an institution _ will be even more serious than any temporary encouragement of previously rejected forms of racial discrimination,'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> continued. `` The court has inflicted a serious _ and unwise _ wound upon itself today,'' he said. He was joined by Justices <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>. The majority said the dissenters were making it sound like the court was overturning the 1976 decision. `` We have of course done no such thing,'' the majority said. `` It is surely no affront to settled jurisprudence to request argument on whether a particular precedent should be modified or overruled.'' The court took the unusual step of calling for reargument of the racial harassment case in a three-page, unsigned order. The case, argued on Feb. 29, now will be held over until the court's 1988-89 term beginning in October. Voting to rehear the case and expand its scope were Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> and Justice <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. The case stems from an appeal by <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, a black woman, who wants to use a post-Civil War law to force her employer, <ORGANIZATION> McClean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, to pay actual and punitive damages for alleged harassment. The 4th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 upheld a ruling by a federal judge in <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, throwing out her suit. The appeals court said Ms. <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> could not use the Civil War-era law to charge racial harrasment. The appeals court said the law is designed only to ban racial discrimination in hiring, firing and promotion. Ms. <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> still could charge racial harassment under a 1964 civil rights law. But the more recent statute provides that those who win their cases in court only may collect back pay, not potentially heavy damages awarded as compensation for emotional and mental suffering. Civil rights groups say the more limited 1964 law may not be a sufficient deterrent to harassment. Ms. <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, who worked as a teller and file coordinator at <ORGANIZATION> McLean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for 10 years until she was laid off in 1982, charged her boss repeatedly harassed her because she is black. Today's high court action greatly expands the potential significance of the case. The court said it will use the case to reconsider a 1976 ruling, called <PERSON> Runyon </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> McCrary </PERSON>, that said racially segregated private schools which refuse to admit black students violate the Civil Rights Act of 1866. The law was enacted in the aftermath of the Civil War to ensure that recently freed slaves would enjoy all the rights of citizenship. The 1976 ruling has given civil rights groups an important legal weapon to fight discrimination by allowing the law to be used as a basis for suits against private individuals. In a separate dissenting opinion today, <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> said, `` I am at a loss to understand the motiviation of five members of this court to reconsider an interpretation of a civil rights statute that so clearly relfects our society's earnest commitment to ending racial discrimination and in which <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> so evidently has acquiesced.'' In other action, the court: _ Let stand a ban on sexually explicit telephone dial-up message services in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. The justices, without comment, refused to hear arguments that the ban violates free-speech rights. It was the first dial-a-porn case with which the court was confronted. _ Agreed to consider giving federal prison wardens more power to decide what publications inmates may read. The court said it will review a ruling that limits the authority of officials to censor reading material behind prison bars. _ Turned away an appeal by former Vice President <PERSON> Spiro </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON> in a lawsuit alleging he was cheated out of more than $ 2 million for arranging a deal between a defense contractor and the Argentine government. The justices, without comment, refused to order the setting aside of more than $ 340,000 in a special fund <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON> and another businessman would receive if they win the lawsuit. _ Let stand a ruling that property owners' rights are not violated when they are required to remove structures that could interfere with low-flying planes. The court, citing the lack of a `` substantial federal question,'' rejected an appeal by a <LOCATION> Cheyenne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, man fined $ 200 a day for refusing to trim a 48-foot cottonwood tree on his property.

 Only a handful of people left their homes and jobs today when local officials conducted their first evacuation drill in this `` Chemical Valley'' community, the site of the nation's only methyl isocyanate plant. Sirens sounded to signal the evacuation at about 9:25 a.m. and brought little immediate response. About one hour later, only some 30 people had arrived at an emergency shelter set up in nearby <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>. Volunteers participating in the drill, which was designed to simulate a leak in a railroad tanker at the plant, said they believed the operation was going well. But at least one resident said `` mayhem'' would result if a real emergency occurred. Institute is the site of a <ORGANIZATION> Rhone-Poulenc </ORGANIZATION> chemical plant that formerly was owned by <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The plant produces methyl isocyanate, the chemical that leaked from a Union Carbide plant in <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, in 1984, killing more than 2,000 people. Less than a year later, a leak of another chemical at the Institute plant sent 135 people to the hospital, prompting the call by some community leaders for an organized evacuation plan in case of a major leak. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Oden </PERSON>, assistant vice president of academic affairs at <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, next to the plant, was in Institute during the 1985 leak and said today's drill was `` useful'' even if people did n't participate. `` We really did n't know what to do -LRB- then -RRB-. At least now we have some idea,'' she said. `` People normally do n't take things seriously. They do n't think it can really happen.'' Local officials responded to the problem of evacuating the town of 1,500 by building a one-lane emergency road out of town to help residents flee, but the gate to that road is kept locked except when needed. Today was the first time it was used. `` I can envision cars all over the track. It's just a little trail. It would be mayhem. It will be a mess,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, a health and physical education instructor at the state college. Today's evacuation was conducted under special circumstances. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> State called off classes this morning, so there were no students to evacuate from academic buildings. The town also was evacuated in stages so the roads leading out of town would n't be too crowded. `` When this was prepared, people did n't take it seriously,'' said <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurston </PERSON>, a custodian at <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. `` I'm sure if the students were here, they would n't know what was going on.''

 The judge in the Iran-Contra case barred defendants today from presenting witnesses at a pre-trial hearing on whether the prosecution relied on testimony given <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> under a grant of immunity. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> took the action, and gave <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> and two of his co-defendants a tongue-lashing, because they disobeyed his order establishing procedures for the hearing. Independent Counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> was allowed to testify, and he told the court of an elaborate procedure he established so that his entire staff would avoid exposure to the immunized testimony, especially from news reports. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> is unable to use immunized congressional testimony by the defendants to prosecute them, unless perjury is committed. Testifying with immunity during the Iran-Contra hearings were <PERSON> North </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> staff member; his one-time boss, former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> Adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>; and businessman <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>. The fourth defendant, retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, testified without immunity. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said the three immunized defendants `` ignored'' his order that they present a single grand jury witness who might testify that his grand jury testimony was influenced by the immunized congressional testimony. Instead, lawyers for the three immunized defendants sought to present three witnesses, and issued subpoenas for <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> and eight members of his staff to testify at the hearing. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>, who had ordered that only <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> need testify, canceled the subpoenas last week. `` Since the defendants did not comply, they wo n't be allowed to present witnesses,'' he said today when the hearing began. `` It's not unusual that defendants make decisions that they are not going to cooperate with the court. That's their right. We will proceed whether we have confrontation and name-calling or not.'' During the hearing, special independent counsel <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, who is handling the immunity question, introduced into evidence memos written or ordered by <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, which instructed his staff to avoid exposure to the immunized testimony and to other information on the defendants. The memos also included instructions to grand jury witnesses and grand jurors to avoid such exposure, especially through news articles or broadcasts. The defendants in the case are charged with conspiring to use a lawful presidential order permitting the sale of arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> as a springboard to illegal actions, including supplying assistance to the Nicaraguan Contras when such aid was banned.

 More than 75 cars and several trucks have been seized as part of `` Zero Tolerance,'' a crackdown by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> agents on people bringing even the tiniest amount of drugs into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Those caught with drugs also face federal charges and stiff Customs fines. `` We believe we are beginning to get people's attention,'' said <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> LaDage </PERSON>. He said a lot of people `` are wondering if that -LRB- marijuana -RRB- joint was really worth this kind of aggravation and loss.'' Most of the vehicles will be auctioned off after administrative hearings. A few will be returned to their owners, he said. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, said he expects to file charges later this week in a substantial number of cases. Until recently, people caught at the border with what is called `` user'' amounts of drugs usually paid an administrative fine to the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and were released. But under the new program, which started March 21, anyone caught at a border crossing with drugs faces possible arrest on federal charges, regardless of the quantity. Any vehicle found to contain drugs is seized, as is a vehicle carrying a driver or passenger with drugs. On-the-spot fines range from several hundred dollars to more than $ 1,000, and those caught also must agree to appear in federal court. Americans' passports are seized and foreigners found guilty in federal court are n't allowed back into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In one case, <PERSON> LaDage </PERSON> said, a woman returning from a trip to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> with her boyfriend was shocked when her boyfriend was found to be carrying a small amount of drugs and authorities impounded her car. `` She and her boyfriend arrived together at the border,'' he said. `` But I was told they left separately. `` And on foot.''

<DATELINE>DECATUR, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A jury was chosen today for the retrial of a man charged in the killings of six members of a farm family in 1973, and a defense attorney then asked that his client be fitted for dentures to improve his image. It took three weeks to pick 12 jurors and four alternates for the retrial of <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>. After selection was complete, Judge <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> heard arguments on defense motions. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Isaacs </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Dungee </PERSON> were originally convicted and sentenced to death in 1974 for the slayings of six members of the <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> Alday </PERSON> family on their farm in southwest <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Seminole </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. The convictions were overturned in 1985 by the 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, which said fair trials were impossible because of extensive publicity about the case. The appeals court ordered new trials held elsewhere in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> is the second of the three to be retried; his case is being heard in <ORGANIZATION> DeKalb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, near <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Isaacs </PERSON> was convicted in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> earlier this year and was again sentenced to death. After jury selection was completed, <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> heard arguments on a defense request for a continuance to allow <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> to be fitted for dentures. `` We think he will present a less favorable image to this jury'' without the dentures, said <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON>. The judge said he would defer ruling on that motion and one for a change of venue until the close of business today. The change of venue motion asks that the trial be moved to another location, citing extensive publicity in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. Another motion seeking <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Isaacs </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Isaacs </PERSON>' younger brother, as a defense witness was denied. <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> said that since the younger <PERSON> Isaacs </PERSON> is to be a witness for the prosecution, defense attorneys will have chance to cross-examine him. <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Isaacs </PERSON>, who was 15 when he witnessed the slayings, turned state's evidence and testified at the original trials. He is serving a 40-year prison sentence. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Isaacs </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Dungee </PERSON> were escapees from a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> prison when they were arrested. <PERSON> Alday </PERSON>, his brother and three sons were shot one by one on May 14, 1973, when they arrived at the home of one of the sons, where <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> and his companions were interrupted in a burglary, according to testimony.

<TEXT>
 Government-backed family planning has cut Chinese births by about 200 million in recent years, but baby boomers are leading another population surge, according to an official report quoted Monday. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s family planning policy, which limits the number of children per couple and promotes late childbearing, has cut the births since the 1970s, the domestic <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said in a report appearing in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> newspapers. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the world's most populous nation, has more than 1 billion people. Officials have estimated it must keep the birth rate below 1.5 percent to reach its planned population limit of 1.2 billion at the turn of the century. But the birth rate was 2 percent in each of the last two years. A primary reason for the increase, expected to last until at least 1995, is that people born in the baby boom years of 1962-75 are reaching maturity and having their own babies, the reports said.

 Acid rain could be almost as big a contributor as fertilizer runoff or sewage and industrial water pollution to the decline of marine life in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> estuaries, an environmental group concluded today. A study by the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> said nitrate compounds from the atmosphere _ originating mostly as nitric acid _ contribute 25 percent of the total nitrogen input to <LOCATION> Cheasapeake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, compared with 34 percent from fertilizers and 23 percent from municipal sewage and industrial discharges. Nitrates act as fertilizers, encouraging `` blooms'' of algae that use up oxygen dissolved in the water and making it difficult for other plants and fish to live. These airborne compounds also are contributing to problems in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Albemarle-Pamlico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> Sound between <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bight </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> off <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, the group's scientists said. `` The problem of enhanced primary productivity from atmospheric nitrogen inputs appears to be widespread along the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seaboard </LOCATION>,'' the fund's report said. Release of the report kicked off three days of rallies, press conferences and other events by environmental groups timed to coincide with this week's visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> by Canadian Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, supported by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> environmentalists, for years has been unsuccessfully pressing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to act against the pollution precursors that form acid rain and flow northward across the border before falling on <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. The most-often-mentioned precursor is sulfur dioxide, which turns into sulfuric acid in the atmosphere. Sulfur dioxide is mostly emitted by coal-burning power plants, but an estimated one-third of the rainfall acidity in the eastern <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> actually comes from oxides of nitrogen, which become nitric acid in the atmosphere. Nationwide, about one-third of nitrigen oxides originate in power plant emissions, one-third in motor vehicle exhaust and one-seventh in industrial emnissions. Today's report was the first to estimate the input to <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> of nitrates originating in the atmosphere not only as direct rain and other deposition on the bay itself _ an estimated 9,150 tons per year _ but also in runoff from the land of the bay's watershed _ 29,400 tons per year The fund estimated that 154,000 tons of nitrogen compounds from all sources wind up in the bay. The total of 154,000 tons was in the range of estimates given by the joint federal-state <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> pollution control program, 92,000 tons to 198,000 tons. The fund called on the joint program to adopt measures aimed at reducing atmospheric deposition of nitrogen compounds to the bay and its watershed by 40 percent. The program already has adopted a goal of reducing nitrogen and phosphorous discharges to the bay by 40 percent. At the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> said no agency expert had had a chance to study the fund's report and the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> therefore was not in a position to comment.

<HEAD>British Airways To Begin First of Smoking Ban Trials Tuesday</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAGGIE JACKSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> will ban smoking on one of its busiest domestic routes for a month beginning Tuesday in the first of a series of smoke-free flights. The airline will forbid an estimated 2,500 passengers from lighting up on its 12 daily one-hour shuttle flights between <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> airport and <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. On June 6, some <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> flights to the continent will become smoke-free for a month, and in November some <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and New York-bound flights join the experiment. Several small British carriers have banned smoking on domestic and international flights, but <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> is the largest to try it. The company's only domestic competitor, British <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, said it had no plans to ban smoking. Unlike the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where the government forced airlines to ban smoking on all domestic flights shorter than two hours, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has no national laws concerning smoking. About 34 percent of British adults smoke cigarettes. British Airways officials said they took action because research showed that if smoking were banned, the number of customers who would fly more often was four times the number who would switch airlines. `` In recent years demand for non-smoking areas on our aircraft have grown and grown. Today on most routes smokers are very much in the minority,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, marketing director for the airline. `` We have steadily increased non-smoking areas to reflect this trend. ... Now we want a full trial of customer reaction to see if we can extend the idea still further.'' Airline spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Blunt </PERSON> said the carrier will decide whether to continue the bans after studying surveys and other passenger response. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Eyres </PERSON>, director of a pro-smoking group, criticized the idea as discriminatory, dangerous and unnecessary. `` Our view is that so long as non-smokers' wishes are respected with definite no-smoking areas, there also ought to be areas where smokers can light up and not be treated like social lepers,'' he said. He said the bans would lead to safety risks from people smoking in toilets, and said that it was unnecessary because cabin air is changed every three minutes. Opposition lawmaker <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Foulkes </PERSON> said Monday he would introduce a bill in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday to ban smoking in the workplace, saying `` some people regard it as torture to have to work in a smoke-filled workplace.'' But opposition legislation rarely passes the legislative body, and a government spokesman said that government planned no national laws banning smoking on airlines or in public places. `` It's like drinking, it's a question of choice. It's a part of society's freedoms,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayward </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. `` At this moment this government has no intention to inhibit this generally accepted freedom.''

<TEXT>
 An explosion and fire struck the submarine USS Bonefish off <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, forcing the crew to abandon ship, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said. Three of the 92-member crew were missing today and 23 were injured. Crews from two frigates and a helicopter searched the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> for the missing men after Sunday afternoon's fire, `` looking and listening for any kind of sound or indication'' of the men, said Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Sonntag </PERSON> of the Norfolk-based <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're doing everything we can to find them out there,'' he said. The submarine was afloat alongside the frigate USS McCloy, officials said. `` No one has been back on board to assess the damage,'' Chief Petty Officer <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Borton </PERSON> said today from <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION> headquarters here. `` At this time, there is no smoke coming from the vessel.'' The Bonefish, one of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s last diesel-electric submarines, surfaced Sunday afternoon 160 miles east of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, said Cmdr. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Leeder </PERSON>, a fleet spokesman. The fire was believed caused by an explosion in the 30-year-old submarine's battery compartment, Sonntag said. Because of fire and toxic fumes, the commanding officer ordered the vessel evacuated, he said. Of the missing, `` We do n't know whether they are still aboard the submarine or whether they were in the water,'' said Capt. <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, another fleet spokesman. The injured were transfered to the aircraft carrier <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and taken to the <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, according <PERSON> Borton </PERSON>. The extent of the injuries were unknown, but `` some of them had smoke inhalation,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. A spokesman for the hospital, <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, said that of the 23 injured, 20 were ambulatory, but he had no further information. The remainder of the Bonefish's crewmen were taken aboard the frigate USS <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> and taken to <LOCATION> Mayport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, for a flight back to the Bonefish's home port of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, S.C. The solemn-faced crewmen refused requests from reporters to answer questions about the fire when they arrived in <LOCATION> Mayport </LOCATION>. Most were wearing blue coveralls and sneakers, but many were shoeless. A few carried small plastic bags, apparently holding a few of their belongings. They were taken to a waiting cargo plane. Chaplain <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> went aboard the <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> and visited the men. He said the general mood was `` overwhelming fatigue,'' adding that most had been up all night and many had been on watch the night before. `` They've been through a real trauma,'' he said. <PERSON> Leeder </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> would attempt to tow the submarine either to <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, or <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>. There apparently was no serious problem in keeping it afloat late Sunday, <PERSON> Leeder </PERSON> said. The submarine rescue ship USS Petrel from <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> is on its way and will determine whether the fire is out, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said. The Petrel is expected to arrive early this afternoon. `` People from the Petrel will be boarding the sub to make any kind of damage assessment,'' said Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON>, also a <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> spokesman, adding that afterward, a decision would be made on where to tow the sub. <PERSON> Leeder </PERSON> said it would take considerable time to tow the Bonefish into port. It can make about 3 mph under tow, a senior naval officer said. The Bonefish had been taking part in routine exercises for about a week with the <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> and the JFK in what is called the <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> Operations area, authorities said. The sub was commissioned in 1959 and is used primarily for training, <PERSON> Leeder </PERSON> said. The 2,895-ton, 219-foot submarine was built by <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipbuilding </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, and launched in 1958. It normally carries a crew of 82. It is capable of traveling about 15 knots on the surface and about 21 knots submerged, according to <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s Fighting Ships It is powered by three 1,500-horsepower diesel engines that drive a single propeller while traveling on the surface. Once submerged, it is driven by two electric motors. The Bonefish, like its sister vessels the Barbel and <PERSON> Blueback </PERSON>, is capable of carrying torpedoes, but no missiles. They were the last diesel-electric combat submarines to be constructed for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and were expected to be decomissioned in the'80s. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials use the diesel-powered subs to simulate Soviet submarines because the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> still operates approximately 100 diesel-electric vessels. In all, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> operates four diesel-electric boats.

 Education Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s report that American education is doing better but not well enough met today with a failing grade from one teachers' union for absolving the federal government `` from any responsibility for improving public education. Teachers deserve the credit for the academic progress in the five years since a similar study became a biting critique of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> education called `` A Nation At Risk,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Another teachers' union called the <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> report `` a mixed bag.'' His report, a follow-up requested by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for the fifth anniversary of `` A Nation At Risk,'' said that American schools `` have begun the long climb back'' but that the nation is still at risk from an academic system rife with mediocrity and resistant to change. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> says <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> teen-agers are taking more math, science and advanced placement courses, and scoring somewhat higher on college-entrance and other tests. But `` curricular foolishness has not been eliminated from American high schools,'' he said, and the schools `` are still much too cavalier about homework.'' In his evaluation of the impact of school reform, called `` American Education: Making It Work,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said: `` American education has made some undeniable progress in the last few years. The precipitous downward slide of previous decades has been arrested, and we have begun the long climb back to reasonable standards. ... `` We are doing better than we were in 1983. But we are certainly not doing well enough. ... We are still at risk.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> will deliver his report to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in a White House ceremony Tuesday, the fifth anniversary of the provocative report by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Excellence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> that warned of `` a rising tide of mediocrity'' in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> schools. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which is frequently at odds with <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, planned to mark the anniversary Tuesday with a protest in <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> across from the White House. `` I give the report a failing grade,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> president. `` It absolves the federal government from any responsibility for improving public education. On the plus side, teachers deserve the credit for the academic progress the students have made since 1983. `` Had it not been for the efforts of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which held back the tide of budget cuts proposed by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Administration,'' she said, `` schools would have been in much worse shape, which gives <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> an A.'' `` Its a mixed bag,'' said <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Usdan </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the American Federation of Teachers. `` He highlights what happened over the last five years, that there's been a lot of good, including increases in teachers' salaries and standards that have been tightened.'' But, she said, there's a lot that needs still to be done and `` the question is whether these kinds of reforms are going to do the job that's needed.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said too many students drop out, `` and too many of those who do graduate have been poorly educated. Our students know too little, and their command of essential skills is too slight. `` Good schools for disadvantaged and minority children are much too rare. ... An ethos of success is missing from too many American schools,'' he said. `` Our teachers and principals are too often hired and promoted in ways that make excellence a matter of chance, not design.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> called anew for merit pay for teachers; wider choice in public education for parents; stronger curricula at all levels, and stricter accountability for educators, including freedom for local schools to hire the best and fire the worst teachers and principals. He said a forthcoming <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assessment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progress </ORGANIZATION> report indicates 9 - and 17-year-olds improved their performance in math between 1982 and 1986, while 13-year-olds held steady Another National Assessment will show that in those same years, `` 17-year-old science students made up nearly all the ground lost since the 1977 assessment,'' he said. A new federal study indicated that 12.7 percent of last year's high school seniors completed all the courses recommended in `` A Nation At Risk:'' four years of English; three years each of math, science and social studies; a half-year of computer science and, for the college-bound, two years of foreign language By comparison, fewer than 2 percent of graduates in the Class of 1982 took such a regimen. Researchers reviewed the transcripts of 15,000 graduates from each year. The same study indicated fewer students are drifting into less rigorous `` general tracks'' in high school. Only 17 percent were on a `` general track'' in 1987, down from 35 percent in 1982. But American students still are humbled by international comparisons, including a recent science assessment that found American 10-year-olds were average, `` but our 14-year-olds are far behind their peers around the world, placing 14th out of 17 countries,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. He took a slap at what he called the Chicken Littles who believe that `` some children ca n't learn because their color, class or family background gets in th way.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said minorities already comprise 28 percent of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s school-age population `` Apocalyptic analyses and Chicken Little stories about an onrushing wave of ` unteachable' students should be rejected,'' he said. `` Above all, sound education reforms are threatened by the determined opposition they elicit,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said, pointing to `` what might be called opposition by extortion, the false claim that to fix our schools will first require a fortune in new funding.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s predecessor, T.H. <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, who commissioned `` A Nation At Risk,'' has accused the president of failing to provide strong leadership for school reform. Bell and such groups as the <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Teaching and the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> have warned in recent months that school reform is not working in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s largely minority inner-city school systems. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, however, said `` achievement can be torpedoed by the idea that it is mostly a matter of luck, wealth or native ability _ an idea altogether too prevalent in American education today.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said average teacher salaries, after inflation, have risen from $ 23,451 in 1982-83 to an estimated $ 28,300 today, nearly a 21 percent rise, and more college students are expressing interest in the profession. But `` until good teachers are paid more than bad ones, our efforts to improve teaching and learning will be frustrated.'' He complained that there are more penalties `` for serving up a single rotten hamburger in a restaurant than for repeatedly furnishing a thousand children with a rotten education.'' `` We urgently need to improve our methods for locating able and talented teachers and administrators, for encouraging and promoting them, and for penalizing those who consistently fail to do their job,'' he said. `` Accountability is the linchpin of education reform.''

 Sailors who abandoned ship when the submarine USS Bonefish caught fire arrived here today aboard a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> frigate for a flight back to their home port of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, S.C. The 66 uninjured crewmen were solemn faced and refused to answer reporters' questions about Sunday's fire aboard the submarine. They were taken to a waiting cargo plane.

 Sales of existing homes, spurred by lower mortgage rates, edged up 2.5 percent in March for the second month in a row, a real estate trade group said Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> said existing single-family homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted rate of 3.33 million units last month. Despite the March rise, which followed an identical 2.5 percent increase in February, the rate of sales remained 9.8 percent below March 1987. The sales pace had dipped in November, December and January. `` Housing activity has recovered from the low levels of -LRB- the winter -RRB-, but even so we can expect to see fewer sales ... in 1988 than in 1987,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Obrinsky </PERSON>, an economist with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON>, the Realtors' chief economist, attributed the sales increase to lower interest rates. `` We expect the recovery to continue with April's -LRB- sales -RRB- figures, likely to be up also,'' he said. A year ago, 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages bottomed out at just above 9 percent. They rose in spurts, topping 11.5 percent in early October. Rates eased after the stock market crash, dipping just below 10 percent in February and March before rising again to 10.3 percent last week. <PERSON> Obrinsky </PERSON> said interest rates were likely to rise slowly and steadily this year, but he said that would disrupt sales less than the sharp jumps taken by interest rates in 1987. `` I think on balance we could see sales still hold up for some months down the road before the impact of the higher mortgage rates begins to take its toll,'' he said. The March sales increase was accompanied by a 4.1 percent rise in prices to a national median, or midpoint, of $ 88,700, up from $ 88,100 in February. <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON> predicted only modest increases for the rest of the year. By region, the median resale price was $ 143,100 in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, compared with $ 128,900 a year ago; $ 117,100 in the West, compared with $ 105,900; $ 84,000 in the South, compared with $ 81,200, and $ 67,800 in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, down from $ 68,300. Sales were led by a 9.6 percent advance in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 570,000 units and a 6.7 percent boost to 1.27 million units in the South. Sales were unchanged in the Northeast at 660,000 units and down 3.4 percent in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> to 860,000 units.

 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said today he would talk with terrorists holding hostages but `` never make concessions,'' commenting one day after campaign rival <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> criticized what he said was <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' view that `` we should not negotiate with terrorists.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> set off the exchange Sunday when he said, `` I've raised the point in several debates this year. Every time a question comes up about terrorism, Mr. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says, ` I'm against terrorism. ... We should not negotiate with terrorists. ... In the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, never negotiate with terrorists.' `` I disagree with that; If I could get the hostages out, I'd do it.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, told reporters today after being asked about <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s statement, `` I think we need a tough anti-terrorist policy. ... `` I do n't have a problem with talking, but you never make concessions to terrorists _ ever. If you do, what you end up with is hostage-taking and terrorism all over the world.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, asked today about negotiating with terrorists, said he would not make `` material concessions'' to them but could conceive of situations in which he would grant hostage-takers safe passage. `` I would never exchange arms for hostages,'' he said, a reference to the Iran-Contra operations steered by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy holds that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials `` will talk to any official or group about the safety and release of hostages but we will not make concessions,'' a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said today. The gentle battling between the surviving Democratic candidates got more direct as the candidates closed in on Tuesday's delegate-rich <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> primary A new poll, sponsored by <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> KYW-TV </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>'s KDKA-TV, showed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> apparently increasing his lead among likely <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Democratic voters In the new poll, taken by telephone over the weekend, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> led <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> 57 percent to 31 percent with 12 percent still undecided. Last week, with Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> still being counted, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> led <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> 45 percent to 34 percent, with 14 percent undecided and 7 percent for <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>. The polls, with a margin of error of five percentage points either way, were conducted by <ORGANIZATION> KRC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. It was <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> who has stirred the biggest controversy in recent days with his call on Sunday for negotiation with anyone to free hostages. `` In this world, in this ambiguous world, you must not set up preconditions that stop effectiveness,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said at a rally in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` I would meet with anyone I could meet with to get the hostages out of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>.'' Eight Americans are currently held hostage by Moslem extremists in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. On Sunday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did a whistle-stop tour of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, but he was switching to the air today, hitting six cities to make an impression in every media market in the state before the voters go to the polls Tuesday. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> raised money in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> before returning late Sunday for a final push in the <ORGANIZATION> Keystone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has a big lead in the polls in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, where 178 delegates are at stake. The complicated process _ with delegates elected individually _ offers a challenge to voters who may have to pull the lever up to 12 times. But it also offers <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, if he does well, a chance to win as many as 100 more delegates than <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` You've got to vote more than once. This is the one time you can do so legally,'' he told students at <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. `` Vote early and often _ vote for me and vote for my delegates.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is more than half the way to a delegate majority, holding 1,075.15 national convention votes. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has 836.1 while 599.75 were uncommitted. A tally of 2,081 or more is needed to win the nomination at the July convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION>'s three convention votes entered the uncommitted column Sunday evening following caucuses on the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> island. On the Republican side, Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is virtually unchallenged on Tuesday in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, when he may win enough of the 78 delegates at stake to go over the magic majority mark _ 1,139 _ needed to win the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> in August. A new poll by Time magazine indicates that a Dukakis-Jackson ticket would get 47 percent of the vote nationwide to 42 percent for a Republican ticket headed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. A Dukakis-Gore ticket would defeat <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> 49 percent to 39 percent, but <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would defeat <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> by 52 percent to 34 percent, according to the poll released Sunday. On the Democratic side, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> have been unusually cordial recently, but the best-friends atmosphere thinned when <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> urged <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to release a proposed budget. `` I'm not just for <ORGANIZATION> Head </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Start </ORGANIZATION>, I'm willing to pay for Head Start,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said during the debate Saturday night in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. `` I have put numbers together to pay for my dreams.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> strongly disagreed. `` You ca n't prepare a budget now for next year _ that's absurd,'' he told reporters Sunday on his chartered <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> train, nicknamed the `` <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Presidential Unlimited. `` I'll lay out where I'm going to make the cuts _ I've done that in great detail,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said as he toured western <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Mayors, Police Chiefs Hear Federal Drug Message</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Field commanders in the national war on drugs heard a pair of federal battle plans on Monday, plans that found different groups to blame for the growing problem, and different solutions. A Democratic member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> charged that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration lacked an organized plan to battle drugs, and he called for a drug summit meeting with the heads of Latin American nations. A top aide to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, on the other hand, said it was time to put more pressure on those who use drugs. In remarks to a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayors </ORGANIZATION>, Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said it was not enough that the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and other <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> agencies were battling drugs. They should be getting help from the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, `` It's not a question of whether we're losing the battle, it's a question that we do n't even know who's in charge of the war,'' <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON> told a session of mayors and police chiefs. But <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s assistant for policy development, told the meeting that the nation does not appear to have reached the collective state of mind neded to defeat the drug problem. Drugs pour into <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> because there is a market for them, he said, and the battle needs to be waged against the users. Accomplices in crime are young couples who think it's all right to use drugs casually on the weekend, abstainers who look away when others use drugs, sports heroes who set a bad example by using drugs, college presidents who know drugs are on campus but fail to act, civil libertarians who tie up the courts with technicalities and sophistry and television and movie producers who glorify drugs, <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON> said. `` Unless we find the political will to penalize the users as well as the dealers,'' the drug problem will remain, he said. The nation can not buy or blast its way drug free with financial programs and the military, he said. <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON>, pressed by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Barthelemy </PERSON>, said he plans to introduce a measure to direct federal anti-drug funds directly to large cities, rather than through federal and state bureaucracies. In addition, <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON> called for increased participation of all federal agencies in anti-drug battles. To begin with, he said, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> should call a summit of nations from <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to find ways to cooperate in the drug war. A plan must be developed to work with people. `` You ca n't take a farmer who is making $ 10,000 on coca leaves and tell him to go back to his former crop that made $ 500,'' <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON> said. In addition to involving the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON> questioned the reluctance of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to join in patroling the borders, asked for <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> anti-drug programs and suggested drug rehabilitation organized by the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> department. As to the suggestion that more and more drug users be arrested: `` Where do you put them?'' he said.

<TEXT>
 A top Sandinista official was in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> today for talks with representatives of the Contra rebels as the two sides prepared for a new round of peace negotiations in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> later this week. Sandinista Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> was meeting secretly with the Contra directors' secretary to discuss `` the agenda and arrangements'' for talks to begin Thursday in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, rebel leader <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> also said the Contras will demand the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> immediately allow <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> food and supplies to rebel troops as a precondition for any further talks based on the agreement reached last month in <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. `` If that is not done the whole <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION> agreement will collapse,'' <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> said. An internal Contra memo written by <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Fley </PERSON>, who goes by the name Cmdr. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, recently called the situation of the Contras troops in the field `` critical.'' <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> must immediately agree on what the rebels call the `` modus operandi'' for getting the humanitarian aid to the Contra forces inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The plight of the troops has reportedly been a contributing cause to a rift among the Contra leaders, but today <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> downplayed the differences among the five directors. He denied leading a movement to fire top Contra Cmdr. <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>, but acknowledged two other rebel field commanders, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Diogenes </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernadnez </PERSON>, had objected to the peace talks. He also said three top civilian employees of the rebel troops had been replaced by military officials. But he inisted there was still unity among the directors of the Nicaraguan Resistance, as the Contras are formally called. All five directors, including <PERSON> Aristides </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, who skipped the last meeting in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> for `` personal reasons,'' will fly to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> for this week's negotiations, <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> refused to discuss where <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> was conducting the pre-meeting talks with the directors' secretary in strongly anti-communist <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. But he said there were no plans for the Sandinista foreign ministry official to talk with the directors themselves here. <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> previously has accused the Contras of engaging in political maneuvering to avoid a definitive cease-fire while they receive <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> will speed up its <ORGANIZATION> DataStream </ORGANIZATION> news delivery system to about 9,000 words a minute beginning in June, add to its news staff, and introduce new photo and graphics services, President <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boccardi </PERSON> announced Monday. He said these ventures into `` the new world of news'' will help the news cooperative meet its responsibilities to its members, now numbering a record 1,428. <PERSON> Boccardi </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> annual meeting that 10 to 15 people will be added to the domestic news staff during 1988. `` The bulk of these will go to our line bureaus, whose state and regional news coverage is so important to you,'' he told publishers and editors of newspapers that use the AP. `` With the membership increasing as it has, the demands on our state bureaus are increasing. And we must meet those needs.'' <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> said, `` Never in its 140-year history has the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> faced greater challenges or more exciting prospects than in 1988, with newspaper membership at a record-high level. `` A strong, dedicated and talented staff and a commitment to leadership in news technology will meet those challenges,'' <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> said. `` At the same time we members must remember that our cooperation and our help is essential to AP performance.'' <PERSON> Boccardi </PERSON> said the AP is about to move from a speed of about 1,050 words a minute to about 9,000 on its <ORGANIZATION> DataStream </ORGANIZATION> and DataFeature wires. `` We will begin in June installing at highspeed newspapers a new generation of <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> microprocessors that will enable us, state by state, to leap to 9,600-baud delivery,'' he said. For newspapers with systems that need slower speeds, the delivery rate can be reduced, but he said `` the news will fly on <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> circuits at 9600.'' That increase in capacity will avoid crowding that can slow copy delivery just as a crowded highway can slow traffic. `` We are raising the speed limit from 55 mph to 440 mph and ... we're widening the AP interstate from four lanes to eight,'' <PERSON> Boccardi </PERSON> said. He said three successful test installations of the new AP electronic darkroom for large newspapers are in place in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. In June, <PERSON> Boccardi </PERSON> said, the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> will unveil a PC-based electronic darkroom for smaller newspapers. He also announced that the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> will be offering members a new picture transmitter for the handling of their own photos _ a small, portable system enabling a photographer to transmit photos from color or black and white negatives without making prints. The AP already has put that system into use in covering such events as the Winter Olympic Games and the <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> basketball championships in March. The transmitter, called the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> @ <ORGANIZATION> Leafax </ORGANIZATION> 35, was developed to AP specifications by <ORGANIZATION> Leaf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Natick </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. AP holds exclusive distribution rights. By the end of the year, <PERSON> Boccardi </PERSON> said, the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> will begin operating a new service called DataFeature Graphics that will deliver news graphics offered by syndicates and supplemental services. He also said the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> has now converted worldwide to all-color photography, a step taken in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> more than a year ago. By next spring, he said, a new financial markets system will be ready for <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> members. `` You will be able to use our feed to create stock tables in virtually any form you wish, emphasizing local companies or industries, for example,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> on Monday offered to withdraw Afghan troops from their posts near the Pakistani border if anti-communist guerrillas and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> agree to do the same. `` We are ready to create a non-military line'' between <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> said at the opening of celebrations marking the 10th anniversary of the Afghan revolution that installed a Soviet-backed government. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> told an assembly of three small parties loyal to his government that such a withdrawal would allow the estimated 3 million Afghan refugees in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> to return home. However, the proposal appeared to be little more than a face-saving acknowledgement of the difficulties the Afghan army is having against onslaughts by anti-communist guerrillas, based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and supplied with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> weapons. Soviet troops entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in 1979 to help quell an uprising by a guerrilla front. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has agreed to start withdrawing its estimated 115,000 troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on May 15 under a U.N.-mediated agreement signed April 14 in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and several other countries have been aiding the Afghan guerrillas via <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> arms the Afghan military forces. Each superpower has reserved the right to continue its assistance as long as the other one does. The guerrillas, who were not direct party to the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accord, have vowed to continue fighting until <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s government is overthrown. On Sunday, <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> confirmed a guerrilla claim that the Afghan army had been pushed out of <LOCATION> Barikot </LOCATION>, a key post on the Pakistani frontier. Barikot, 150 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, controls a major road leading into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. The guerrillas said the victory opened a new, direct supply route for weapons into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The guerrillas said Monday they have taken control of three other strategic towns in recent weeks: <LOCATION> Ghorband </LOCATION>, 50 miles north of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Maarouf </PERSON> and <PERSON> Darwazgai </PERSON>, both in the south about 30 miles from the Pakistani bordar. Western sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the guerrillas captured Ghorband in late March. There was no immediate word on the other two claims. The guerrillas also said <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s government is negotating with Moslem guerillas for the release of a provincial governor captured by insurgents earlier this month. The insurgents are holding the governor of northern <LOCATION> Kunduz </LOCATION> province, the chief of police and two senior Afghan army officers. The governor and the two other officials were not identified. Brig. <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Haq </PERSON> <PERSON> Ulomi </PERSON> said the Afghan army would withdraw from the border at `` the points that are needed _ several dozen if necessary.'' Ulomi heads the Afghan <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> ruling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Afghanistan </ORGANIZATION>. A foreign diplomat warned that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials were incorrect to assume that guerrilla victories near the Pakistani border were signs the Soviet-backed government was in trouble. `` We are very surprised by the optimism of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials,'' said the diplomat, who asked not be identified. `` They believe the government of <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> will collapse after the withdrawal of the Soviet troops, but this optimism seems to me and to other Western observers to be very worrying because it is absolutely not true,'' he said. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, in his speech at the <ORGANIZATION> Polytechnic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, called the Soviet withdrawal `` the significant event of the year.'' He asserted that the Soviet troops have enabled the Afghan army to maintain a military balance with the guerrillas. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> said his army must maintain this balance and much has to be done to prepare for the return of refugees. About 5 million Afghans _ one-third of the country's population _ have fled since the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> intervention. About 3 milllion are in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, and most of the rest are in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> spoke in <LOCATION> Dari </LOCATION> for one hour to the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Peasants </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Toilers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. His remarks were translated by government employees. The 10th anniversary of the revolution is Wednesday, but parades and speeches marking the event will take place Tuesday.

 Eight <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen who died in a failed attempt to rescue 52 American hostages in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> eight years ago were honored Monday at a ceremony attended by relatives, friends and military officials. `` Time is a great healer of pain,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, the brother Cpl. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of Pine Bluff, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, one of the eight men who died during the abortive rescue mission in the Iranian desert on April 25, 1980. `` Those feeling of sorrow have been replaced with feelings of pride,'' he said. The men _ five from the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and three from the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> _ died when a helicopter collided with a transport plane after officials decided to abandon the mission before entering <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> where 52 Americans were held inside the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy. The hostages were freed in January 1981 after 444 days in captivity. Army Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsh </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, former hostages <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Laingen </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Col. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Roeder </PERSON> were among those attending the 30-minute ceremony, held at <ORGANIZATION> Arlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cemetery </ORGANIZATION> across the <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> from the nation's capital. <PERSON> Roeder </PERSON> said when he first learned of the rescue attempt while he was incarcerated in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> he cried.

<TEXT>
 Only a few weeks before a Soviet pullout, Afghan guerrilla leaders are trying to maintain the illusion of unity while they squabble over ways of establishing an interim government in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Since the signing of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement on April 14, the guerrillas _ who were not party to the accord _ also have stepped up their war against the communists with about a dozen reported operations inside the country. More than 180 enemy troops have been killed or wounded, including 20 Soviets, the guerrillas say. `` What is clear is that in the current month and especially since the signing of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accord, a significant number of enemy military and command posts have fallen to the mujahedeen,'' said <PERSON> Burhaneddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabanni </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Jamiat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, one party in the seven-member anti-communist front. `` These are the last days of the war,'' contended <PERSON> Hamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Karzai </PERSON>, spokesman for the moderate <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. `` As in any war, towards its end, fighting intensifies. Both sides try to establish their hegemony.'' <PERSON> Rabanni </PERSON> said soon after the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accord was signed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, the guerrillas gave orders to all field commanders to launch attacks on enemy strongholds. The rebels have also begun setting up new military bases inside <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, he said. Last week's guerrilla takeover of the Afghan army garrison at <LOCATION> Barikot </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> border should aid the guerrillas in this endeavor. The guerrillas said Friday's victory opened a new, direct supply route for weapons into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> acknowledged the guerrilla victory on Sunday. On Monday, the guerrillas also claimed to have taken control of three other strategic towns in recent weeks: <LOCATION> Ghorband </LOCATION>, 50 miles north of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Maarouf </PERSON> and <PERSON> Darwazgai </PERSON>, both in the south about 30 miles from the Pakistani bordar. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has said it will begin withdrawing its 115,000 troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on May 15. Its troops entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in 1979 to quell an uprsing by anti-communist guerrillas. On the political front, the the leaders of the seven-party guerrilla alliance disagree about the structure of a `` provisional government'' and how to go about setting it up. <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON>, a 44-year-old engineer with the hardline <ORGANIZATION> Ittihad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> who has been named president of the provisional government, said the 14-member cabinet will meet once a week to outline new programs and plans. But <PERSON> Sebaghatullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mojadeddi </PERSON>, leader of the moderate <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> believes the provisional government is a `` joke.'' `` How can we have a government when it has not been approved by the people,'' he said. `` Up to 700,000 Afghans are armed and when the government is weak, there are going to be clashes and bloodshed.'' The parties are also divided over the form of elections to be held for approving an interim government. Some want elections among the estimated 3 million Afghan refugees in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>: others favor elections inside <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> as well as in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. The guerrillas do agree on one thing: there is no chance for reconciliation with Afghan President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> and his communist supporters. They differ, however, on the question of how to deal with the communists should they be overthrown. Alliance chief <PERSON> Gulbaddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>, the most hardline of the guerrilla leaders has called for a trial of <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> and other communists. <PERSON> Mojaddedi </PERSON>, however, says if <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> and others `` repent'' and `` embrace Islam'' they ought to be pardoned. `` This is not the time for revenge,'' he said.

<HEAD>Court Lets Stand Ban on Sexually Explicit Phone Services in

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, confronted with its first `` dial-a-porn'' case, today let stand a ban on sexually explicit telephone dial-up message services in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. The justices, without comment, refused to hear arguments that the ban violates free-speech rights. The court's action comes at a time when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and state governments have taken steps to crack down on dial-a-porn companies whose services are available to callers through 976 numbers and <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's 900 long-distance lines. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last week sent to the president a bill that would ban all dial-a-porn services. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> lawyers said the proposed law likely would be ruled unconstitutional. They support providing means of having the services available only to those who want them. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> last week levied $ 600,000 in fines against two <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> dial-a-porn firms accused of failing to prevent children from hearing their messages. Among the states, the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utilities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> most recently ordered the state's telephone companies to provide low-cost blocking for customers who want to cut off access from their phones to dial-a-porn and other pay services. Blocking is available to phone subscribers in 21 of the 34 states where local 976 services are available, according to a recent survey by State Telephone Regulation Report, a Virginia-based industry newsletter. Only in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> can customers have 976 calls blocked at no cost. Anti-pornography groups do not like the blocking alternative to flat bans because they say it puts a financial burden on the phone subscriber and not the provider. The 976 and 900 exchanges also are used for other, non-controversial types of messages such as sports scores, time checks and stock market and weather reports. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> <PERSON> Keirnes </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Decency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Through </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a public interest law firm based in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, specializing in obscenity law, said the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s decision `` clearly puts the ball in the phone companies' court.'' He said the decision means <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> companies now can pull the plug on dial-a-porn providers without fear of violating the companies' First Amendment rights. In <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 announced a new policy banning from its 976 message network all firms that `` provide adult entertainment messages with sexually oriented content.'' The policy _ not imposed in other states where <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> provides phone service _ was challenged by two firms, <ORGANIZATION> Carlin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Sapphire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, as impeding their freedom of speech. Only the government or some agent of the government can violate someone's constitutional rights, and so the two dial-a-porn companies argued that <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>'s policy represented `` state action.'' They noted that <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> is a heavily regulated public utility and pointed to various pressures state authorities had put on <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> to rid its 976 network of such message services. For example, the <LOCATION> Maricopa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutor cited a state criminal law shielding minors from harmful items in a letter which said, `` Should Mountain Bell continue to air these messages, it is the intention of this office to prosecute not only the subscribers who provide the messages but <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>.'' A federal trial judge ruled that <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> could not refuse to carry the dial-a-porn messages but the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> reversed that ruling last year. Noting that `` modern telephonic technology permits the pervasive transmission of vast quantities of information, as well as <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> and smut,'' the appeals court said <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>'s policy did not amount to `` state action.'' A similar decision by another federal appeals court previously enabled <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> to keep dial-a-porn services out of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. Justice <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> did not participate in the court's denial of review to <ORGANIZATION> Carlin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, 87-1479

 The rapist who savagely mutilated a teen-age girl nine years ago is free from parole today, but friends of <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> worry about his safety wherever he tries to settle. When <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> was paroled from prison a year ago, furious protests followed him from town to town as state officials tried to find a place for him to live. Protesters were outraged that the 60-year-old former merchant marine served only eight years for his crime, a six-year reduction because of good behavior and work credits. After Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> intervened, <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> wound up in a mobile home on the grounds of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quentin </LOCATION> prison. Last week officials moved him to an undisclosed location. As of midnight Sunday, <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> was free to go wherever he liked and was under no obligation to tell prison officials his whereabouts. He has told <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Bride </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Azalea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, he would like to live there after first visiting his sister in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. But his safety is uncertain, say some of <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON>'s supporters. After news reports <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> might live at the <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> church farm, several shots were fired at its buildings, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Plath </PERSON>, an attorney and member of <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a religious group that befriended <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> during his parole. `` This is a country of laws,'' <PERSON> Plath </PERSON> said in a recent interview. `` He served his time. He has a right to be left alone and left in peace.'' <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON>'s victim, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON>, lives in seclusion in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>, and said in published interviews recently that her fear has been revived by <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON>'s impending freedom. `` I'll never get over this,'' said <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON>. <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> hacked off her forearms with an ax on Sept. 29, 1978, and left her for dead in <LOCATION> Stanislaus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, 45 miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. She recently had <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> served with a $ 2.4 million judgment won in a civil lawsuit against him last year in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. She filed the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> order in <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> earlier this month after <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> wrote to county prosecutors asking that they investigate his claim that it was <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> who attacked him. Public outrage has continued almost unabated since <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON>'s release `` Here's a girl who lost her arms and will never get them back, and here's the guy who did it. He got 14 years and he's out in eight,'' said <LOCATION> Stanislaus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Stahl </PERSON>, who prosecuted <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON>. `` There ai n't no justice _ it's the thing I hear over and over and over from everyone.'' <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> has insisted he was innocent, adding that he believes she attacked him. `` I never live in the past,'' he said in a recent television interview. He also passed a lie detector test set up by the <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, which quizzed him on the crime. Former <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Special Agent <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON>, who administered the test, said it only proves that <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> believes he is innocent. The test was demonstrated on a recent public television program about <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON>. In 1979, a jury in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> convicted <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> of kidnap, rape, mayhem and attempted murder in the attack on <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON>, then age 15. He was sentenced to 14 years and four months in prison. <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> was discovered naked on a rural road. She told police her attacker was a man named <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> who picked her up in <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> and told her he would take her to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> but instead took her to a deserted area near <LOCATION> Modesto </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> was arrested 10 days later in <LOCATION> Sparks </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>. Detectives found the burned remains of <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON>'s clothes in the fireplace of <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON>'s house in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pablo </LOCATION>

 The partially clad bodies of three people were found by a motorist outside an abandoned pool hall, and authorities said today the victims were killed execution-style by a half-dozen shotgun blasts. The victims were identified as <PERSON> Bernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON>, 30, of <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackwood </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, 26, and <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Vega </PERSON>, 33, both of <LOCATION> Osceola </LOCATION>, said Lt. <PERSON> J.C </PERSON>. Brewer of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Osceola </LOCATION> residents were apparently acquainted, but he did n't know their connection, if any, to <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON>. Asked about a motive for the slayings, which apparently happened Sunday night, <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON> said: `` We have got only speculation. We have no suspects.'' He said his agency and state police investigators were checking on possibilities that the deaths stemmed from a domestic dispute or might have been drug-related. The bodies were discovered by a motorist in eastern <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> about five miles from <LOCATION> Interstate </LOCATION> <LOCATION> 55 </LOCATION> and some 30 miles north of <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Carney </PERSON>. `` This area is out in the rural part of our county, off a gravel county road. It's completely isolated,'' <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON> said. The bodies were about 10 feet apart, <PERSON> Carney </PERSON> said, and a half-dozen spent 12-gauge shotgun shells were found on the ground. A 1988 <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> found at the scene was registered to the mother of the <LOCATION> Osceola </LOCATION> man, <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON> said. Large portions of the victims' heads were blown away, officers said, and two of the bodies also had extensive damage to their arms, indicating they had placed their hands in front of their faces as they were killed. According to <PERSON> Carney </PERSON>, one of the men had his shirt off and his pants unzipped. The other man had his pants around his ankles. The woman was clad only in sweatpants.

 Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions taken Monday by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. RACIAL DISCRIMINATION The court said it will consider overturning a key civil rights precedent allowing people to sue private citizens accused of racial discrimination. Four dissenting justices accused the court of undermining the trust minority groups have in it. The court, in an extraordinary move, said it will use a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> case involving charges of on-the-job racial harassment to consider throwing out a 12-year-old decision. The case is <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> vs. <ORGANIZATION> McLean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, 87-107. PHONE PORN The court let stand a ban on sexually explicit telephone dial-up message services in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. The justices, without comment, refused to hear arguments that the ban violates free-speech rights. It was the first dial-a-porn case with which the court was confronted. The case is <ORGANIZATION> Carlin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, 87-1479. PRISON PUBLICATIONS The court agreed to consider giving federal prison wardens more power to decide what publications inmates may read. The court said it will review a ruling that limits the authority of officials to censor reading material behind prison bars.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is still mulling whether to increase <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military involvement in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, a White House spokesman said today, amid indications of fresh administration concern about the American presence there. Spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said a number of options are still being weighed and that `` no decisions have been made'' on the possible broadening of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> escort role for neutral ships in the strategic waterway. But <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> contradicted remarks that administration officials had made last Friday, indicating a decision had been made to expand the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> role to allow <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> warships to protect neutral vessels under attack. Officials, who declined to be named publicly, said last week that a more aggressive <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy in the gulf had been decided upon. They said such a policy was aimed at deterring Iranian attacks against gulf shipping. The change in policy, they said at the time, was a direct result of the mining of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> frigate and Monday's extensive fighting between Iranian and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces. But during his daily <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> briefing today, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> talked of the possibility of returning <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in the gulf to the limited rules of engagement that applied before last Monday, when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> attacked two Iranian platforms and the two nations' forces subsequently exchanged fire. While the spokesman emphasized that several options remained under study, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> indicated a concern within the administration about an Americanization of the Iran-Iraq war. `` Right now the rules of engagement are essentially the same as they were last week, reflecting the emergency nature of the situation,'' he said. `` But the question is, where do we move back to? But I ca n't discuss specifics.'' Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, interviewed from <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' program, also indicated a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest in restraining the role of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> military involvement in the gulf. `` We will not get tied up in any serious shooting war with the Iranians,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. He added that the final decision is up to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> _ and that it has n't yet been made. `` As far as our rules of engagement are concerned, what the right ones are for this stage of the game in the gulf are being considered in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, and there is a process of consultation going on and I think it's premature to describe them in any particular way,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that `` during the conflict last Monday, the rules -LRB- of engagement -RRB- were changed to accommodate the military situation that was encountered.'' `` You'll recall at that point that our ships were engaging hostile forces in any number of areas, and we now want to move back to our conservative set of rules. And so that decision has to be made about where to move back to,'' he said. `` You see, the rules were changed to accommodate the military aggression that was encountered that day. Once that is no longer the case, we want to move to something that would be more sustainable in the long term.'' Among the options being examined is adding <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> ships to assist the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> fleet in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, where an Iranian gunboat attack on a neutral vessel drew a muted reaction from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials Sunday. Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, said the attack on a Saudi-owned tanker reflected a `` level of violence ... much less'' than in the mining incident that touched off last week's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retaliatory strike against two Iranian offshore platforms. `` We consider our response on Monday a suitable response for the indiscriminate mining, and we do not contemplate any more violence unless <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> continues what we would say is an indiscriminate and a threatening pattern,'' <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Face the Nation.'' The captain of the Saudi-owned Sea Trader said there were no casualties but the ship suffered slight damage in the grenade and machine gun attack at 7:30 a.m. Sunday -LRB- 11:30 p.m. EDT Saturday -RRB-. On the option of adding <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> vessels, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said the use of the crafts would provide more flexibility in the gulf, but no decision has been made. `` They have somewhat smaller ships which give a better patrolling capability. It would free our larger ships for other missions,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Week With <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> vessels would be ideal for assisting warships in the escort of merchant vessels, watching sea lanes to prevent mine-laying and guarding offshore installations from attacks by small craft. The Coast Guard vessels the Pentagon may send to the gulf are lightly armed, Island-class patrol craft now used mainly against drug traffic in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, the service said today. the 110-foor-long ships travel at a maximum speed of 26 knots and carry two officers, two chief petty officers and an additional crew of up to 14. The ships are armed with one 20 mm machine gun in the front, and two 7.62 mm machine guns elsewhere, said spokesman <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandifer </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s Fighting Ships says each craft can carry an additional 20 mm machine gun. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> remains officially neutral in the 7 -LCB- - year-old Iran-Iraq war although it used <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships to guard American-flagged Kuwaiti tankers from attacks since last summer The Iranian attack on the Sea Trader came hours after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in his weekly radio address, warned <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> that `` continued military and terrorist attacks against nonbelligerents and refusal to negotiate an end to the war will be very costly to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and its people.''

 The chief of oral surgery at <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fitzsimons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> has been accused of trying to inject his hospitalized wife with a suspected pesticide, police said. Police Sgt. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenda </PERSON> said Sunday the alleged incident was the result of an `` ongoing dispute of a domestic nature.'' Col. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Parmer </PERSON>, 52, of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, was arrested late Saturday at <ORGANIZATION> Penrose </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> here after a lab technician said he saw a syringe stuck into his wife <PERSON> Carol </PERSON>'s intravenous support system, police said. <PERSON> Parmer </PERSON> was held in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION> in lieu of $ 500,000 bond on suspicion of attempted first-degree murder. He was still there Monday, according to authorities. <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Parmer </PERSON>, 44, was moved to the intensive care unit after the incident and was listed in good condition. At the time of the incident, she was being treated for deep-vein phlebitis _ a clotting and inflammation of veins of the leg, officials said. `` We ca n't be sure if poison was injected'' until toxicology tests are completed, said hospital spokesman Dr. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON>. `` Clinically, she seems fine.'' Lab technicians with the coroner's office were analyzing the suspected pesticide to determine what it is and how it would affect a human body, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Coroner Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowerman </PERSON> said. The alleged attempted poisoning occurred during the end of visiting hours Saturday, <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON> said. `` A hospital employee came into the room to do a blood drawing on another patient and happened to see what was going on,'' said <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON>. Police at first thought the incident might have been an attempted mercy killing. <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON> said although the woman's phlebitis is serious it is `` not life threatening and certainly not terminal.'' A `` serious incident report'' will eventually be forwarded to the Pentagon for review, officials said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today turned down an appeal by native Hawaiians who say plans for developing geothermal energy in a volcanic area will violate their religious rights. The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the proposed development will not interfere unlawfully with access to sacred land by worshippers of the goddess <PERSON> Pele </PERSON>. The native Hawaiians said the development `` by turning a pristine, virgin rain forest into a spiderweb of pipelines, roads, geothermal wells and production plants ... would by accepted religious doctrine destroy the goddess <PERSON> Pele </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Pele </PERSON> was described as `` the magma, the heat, the vapor, the steam and the cosmic creation which occur in volcanic eruptions. She is seen by <PERSON> Pele </PERSON> people in the lava, images of her standing erect, dancing and extending her arms with her hair flowing into the steam and clouds.'' At issue are more than 9,000 acres of land in an area called the <LOCATION> Kilauea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rift </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zone </LOCATION> on the island of <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Hawaii </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled in July that state officials did not infringe on the religious practices of the natives by setting aside the land for geothermal development. The state court noted that the development site was moved about five to 10 miles from a location `` where tradition suggests <PERSON> Pele </PERSON> resides.'' The state court said the natives failed to prove significant harm would be done to their religious practices. But the worshippers of <PERSON> Pele </PERSON> said it is impossible to identify the precise sacred areas where they are commanded by the goddess to conduct private ceremonial rituals. The precise sites are revealed by mysterious signs, they said. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last week ruled in a similar case from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> that road-building and timber-harvesting in a national forest does not violate Indians' freedom of religion even if land they consider sacred is altered. The case acted on today is <PERSON> Dedman </PERSON> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Hawaii </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> and Natural Resources, 87-605.

 An American trying to become the first woman to complete the 2,000-mile trans-Himalayan run arrived in <LOCATION> Katmandu </LOCATION> on Monday _ behind schedule and with a broken foot, but determined to carry on. `` Although I'm 10 days behind schedule, I will catch up,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON> after she emerged from the woods with her pet dog, <PERSON> Velia </PERSON>. <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON> said she had broken her foot two weeks earlier and will see a doctor on Tuesday. `` But there is nothing which will prevent me'' from finishing the run, <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON>, 50, declared. <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON>, from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lewis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, started out from Darjeeling, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, and traveled 400 miles before reaching the Nepalese capital more than six weeks later with her 2-year-old German shorthair pointer. She said she had been trying to break a 1984 record set by two British brothers, <PERSON> Adrian </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Crane </PERSON>, in which they completed the trans-Himalayan run in 92 days. But `` I ca n't find the route they mentioned in their report. The route that I took was definitely longer,'' <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON> said. She said she had been suffering from high fever for the last four days and has already lost about 31 pounds. `` Two nights ago, I almost collapsed,'' she added. `` But, I'm optimistic of completing the whole trip I think the worst part of it is over now.'' She said she had been completing about 10 miles to 50 miles a day. The Darjeeling-Katmandu route is the `` hardest mileage I have ever done in my life,'' added <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON>, a veteran long-distance runner. `` This is not only running, but climbing too. The weather turned out very hostile this year. It was snowing in the <LOCATION> Everest </LOCATION> region,'' she said. <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON> became the first woman to run the 1,000-mile route through <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, and also completed a 2,000-mile trip through <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in 1986. She is scheduled to leave <LOCATION> Katmandu </LOCATION> on Thursday and reach <LOCATION> Gulmarg </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Kashmir </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, by early June to finish the run.

 Police arrested <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> wholesalers Monday who were said to be helping the Palestinian rebellion in the occupied lands, and soldiers confiscated identity cards of several dozen Arabs accused of inciting violence. Military spokesmen said a navy patrol craft sank a rubber boat off the Lebanese coast before dawn, killing an undetermined number of Palestinian guerrillas. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said two guerrillas were in the boat. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said loss of their documents would prevent the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> Palestinians from entering <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. It said the Arabs also were ordered to check in with <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> police twice a day. At least 173 Palestinians have been killed since riots began Dec. 8 among the 1.5 million Arabs of the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 war. An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier and Jewish settler also have been killed. Violence has declined in the past few days and Palestinians are expressing frustration with the failure of underground leaders to provide enough financial aid to offset economic sanctions imposed by the Israelis. `` The <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> are asking where is all the support money the underground leadership said it would provide,'' said <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, an Arab-American who promotes non-violent resistance to Israeli rule. He added, however: `` The people are frustrated, but they are n't giving up. Soldiers ordered shops in <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> to stay closed Monday afternoon. Underground leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizaation </ORGANIZATION> leaders told them to open. Soldiers in <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> welded shut the doors of six shops that followed <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> instructions. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, police arrested 14 merchants who opened their shops. `` Whoever is given an order must follow it,'' said <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, a senior <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> police official who watched riot police and officers on horseback close the stores on the Street of the Prophets near the walled <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The 14 shop owners could face up to two years in jail. They opened their stores across from the <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> Gate at 2 p.m., abiding by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> order, and police closed them three minutes later. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities want <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> merchants to open all day, but leaders of the rebellion have ordered stores opened only in the afternoon. Army instructions Monday were that shops on the Street of the Prophets remain closed. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said: `` Indictments will be handed up in a few days, and the matter will be brought before the court.'' A merchant who locked his shop while watched by police said: `` There's no law which says when you must open or close.'' Crowds of shoppers patronized open shops on nearby streets. When asked why the Street of the Prophets was singled out, <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> replied: `` You have to start somewhere.'' But <PERSON> Nabil </PERSON> <PERSON> Feidy </PERSON>, a merchant on <LOCATION> Saladin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> close by, said those arrested were wholesalers who supplied essential goods to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> to help keep the rebellion going. `` They are the ones who send all kinds of flour to the refugee camps,'' he said. Other Arabs, speaking on condition of anonymity, also said the 14 merchants had supplied goods to underground committees that run the rebellion. Dr. <PERSON> Hyder </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdulshafi </PERSON>, a prominent physician in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, said soldiers there, in addition to confiscating identity cards, were forcing people to report to tax offices even if they did not owe taxes. `` They have to wait on line for hours and hours standing in the sun,'' he said. `` It's the name of the game. They are putting pressure on residents. They are trying to make them give up.'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> was quoted as calling for action against two <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> journalists who did not submit to the military censor stories about <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> involvement in the assassination of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> military commander <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>. Foreign journalists are required to give the censor any material involving security matters. Israeli newspapers quoted defense sources as saying authorities were considering expelling <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Frankel </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, but <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio quoted <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> as indicating lighter measures. `` Maybe they should not be expelled from the country, but they should be punished,'' the radio quoted <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> as saying. <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> made the first reports of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> involvement in <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>'s killing April 16 in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Frankel </PERSON> reported details of the operation. Israeli sources have said <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON> was killed by Israeli commandos, but the government has not confirmed it.

<HEAD>State Department Says Najib Call for Better Ties is `Absurd'</HEAD>

 A call by <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> for better relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is `` absurd,'' the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. In an interview with a 12-member, private <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delgation, parts of which were published Monday in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> said he was ready `` for any kinds of compromise'' with the U.S.-backed rebels trying to topple his Soviet-backed government. One possible compromise is for the return of exiled King <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> to act as a rallying point for a broad-based government that would run the country after the Soviets withdraw their troops, he said. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, which sent elements of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in 1979, has undertaken to start pulling out some 115,000 troops on May 15 under a U.N.-mediated accord. `` All the conditions are now present and I think the Americans could play a great role,'' <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> was quoted as saying. `` We want to live in friendship with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> without losing any element of our friendship with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' But a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON>, said that since the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> views the Soviet-appointed <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> government as illegitimate, `` I think the question of our improving relations with it is absurd.'' She labeled <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s comments Soviet propaganda. In his talk with the Americans, mostly retired officials and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> business executives, <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> also said he would only accept a cutoff of Soviet aid to his government if the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stopped aiding its rebel allies. `` That comment we also view as absurd, of equating Soviet aid to the regime in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistance to the government of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has said it would stop arming and financing the seven rebel groups if the Soviets end their support for the <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> government. Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said the delegation went to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> `` strictly in a private capacity and has no sanction whatsoever from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. `` In fact, before the group members departed for <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, we recommended that they not make the trip and alerted them to the likelihood that the Afghan and Soviet propaganda organs would exploit their activities.'' This is the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation to visit <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> since the 1979 Soviet incursion. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, who heads the group, said after the <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> interview that the Afghan government would have to share power with the rebels before any change could be made in ties with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Two members of the group boycotted the 80-minute interview to show their disapproval for <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> and their support for the rebels, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said.

 Consideration by the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to give the financially strapped <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> a role in <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> patrols ran into heavy sailing Monday on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. `` Ridiculous, hare-brained, absolute utter nonsense,'' was the reaction of Sen. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, who has criticized the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for not devoting more resources to battle against drugs, including seizures of imports. `` I've never heard of anything so stupid,'' <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> told a reporter. `` Do they think the war on drugs is over?'' Sen. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` I do n't know what the rationale for that would be. We've put a lot of additional burdens on the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> in the last few years and I'd think they have a full plate.'' The committee will meet later this week to consider shifting money to the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> because the service has responded to a $ 100 million budget shortfall by suspending routine search and rescue patrols and cutting anti-drug missions by 55 percent. `` They do n't have to go to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> to get money,'' said <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON>. Pentagon officials said in weekend that consideration was being given to send up to a half-dozen 110-foot <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> patrol boats to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. They would be part of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy of protecting 11 reflagged Kuwaiti tankers against attacks by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The lightly armed `` Island'' class patrol boats would be pulled off anti-drug patrols in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officials said Monday. The boats would be replaced by new <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> cutters now under construction. <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandifer </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said `` any effect on drug interdiction would be minimal and temporary.'' <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said Sunday that moving the patrol boats to the gulf `` would free our larger -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- ships for other missions.'' Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> ships could help escort merchant ships, watch sea lanes, prevent mine-laying, and guard offshore installations from small-boat attacks. <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> admitted that if the boats are needed for anti-drug patrols, that need `` would severely complicate the calculus.'' Adm. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yost </PERSON>, commandant of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday the service could be ready to send patrol boats to the gulf region in 60 days. `` If the president, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION>, think those boats would be a help over there, I'm more than delighted to send them and my <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> personnel are ready to go,'' <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> told reporters. `` Really raring and ready to go.'' Administratively, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> is part of the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, but by law, the agency also falls under <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> jurisdiction for national security purposes. <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has offered to pay the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s expenses in mounting the gulf patrols. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> has been hit hard by budget cuts that have resulted from deficit-reduction efforts. The service has a $ 2.7 billion budget this year, which <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> says is $ 100 million less than needed. As result, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> in February closed almost 30 stations and offices, cut anti-drug patrols, and halted routine rescue patrols. The administration last month came up with a plan to shift money within the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and permit more anti-drug patrols. That proposal has yet to be approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The `` Island'' class boats that would be used in the gulf operations have a maximum speed of more than 26 knots and carry a crew of 16, according to <PERSON> Sandifer </PERSON>. The vessels are armed with one 20mm machine gun in the front, and two 7.62 mm machine guns elsewhere Another 20mm machine gun can be added. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` Those boats could be good, but they do n't have any of their own defense against missiles and that's what our ships are running into these days in the gulf.'' `` I'm willing to look at the proposal, but as of right now, it does n't make a lot of sense,'' said <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>. `` I hate to see us pull the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> off drug work.'' Last fall, the Pentagon considered sending <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> vessels to the gulf, but decided against the idea, in part because the boats are so lightly armed. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has attacked shipping with a variety of boats, particularly speedboats. The Iranians have at least two dozen Swedish-made `` Boghammer'' boats, which have been armed with machine guns and rocket launchers.

 President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> met Monday, seeking to end five years of bloody rivalry and to revive a hardline alliance against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> peace plan. Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Jibrane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kourieh </PERSON> said the two key <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders met for 3 -LCB- hours in <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>'s Muhajirine palace and talked in particular about the Palestinian uprising in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the need to support it. `` We all agreed that this is a rare opportunity ... that would lead to the restoration of warm relations between <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>,'' <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Nayef </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawatmeh </PERSON> said before the meeting. It was the second time that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> have talked face-to-face since the <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> president threw the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader out of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> in June 1983. They met briefly at the Arab summit in <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, in November. If their talks are successful, it will mean the end of a rift that seriously hampered Arab efforts to unite in opposition to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s Foreign Minister, <PERSON> Farouk </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Sharaa </PERSON> and seven of <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s senior aides _ all members of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION>, the main <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla group _ attended the meeting in the heavily guarded palace, the spokesman said Like <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, most of them had not visited <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> since <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was expelled at the height of a Syrian-backed mutiny in the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s aides arrived in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> last week for the funeral of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s military commander, <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>, assassinated in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, on April 16. Israeli sources have said <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON> was killed by Israeli commandos, but the government has not confirmed it. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> failed to show up for the funeral Wednesday and flew in Sunday from <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> after <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> and Algerian President <PERSON> Chadli </PERSON> <PERSON> Benjedid </PERSON> intervened. Monday's crucial session followed a meeting between <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> and a ranking <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> envoy, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Kharroubi </PERSON>, who accompanied <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> on Sunday. Officials released no details of that meeting. <PERSON> Hawatmeh </PERSON>, who leads the <ORGANIZATION> Marxist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION>, said that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s three-hour session with Palestinian leaders hammered out an agenda for the future. <PERSON> Hawatmeh </PERSON> said the top priorities were the Palestinian uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' latest <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace plan, presented to the region's leaders last month by Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. `` These are two very important developments, how to bolster the uprising and foil <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s plan,'' <PERSON> Hawatmeh </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> have separately rejected <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s proposal for limited Palestinian self-rule in the occupied territories. Both want an independent Palestinian state in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. The peace plan also does not give the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> a role in the peace process. Arabs, however, regard the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> as the sole representative of the world's 5 million Palestinians. Asked if it was not too early to talk of an alliance when <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> has been in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> only 24 hours, <PERSON> Hawatmeh </PERSON> declared: `` The fact that he's here means the feud is over. `` Now we have to move on to the next stage, reviving the strategic alliance.'' <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, along with <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and Marxist <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION>, formed what was called the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steadfastness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> after the late President <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> signed the 1978 U.S.-brokered Camp David accord that led to a peace treaty with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> a year later. The anti-peace accord alliance fell apart when the Syria-PLO feud began. The feud erupted after <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1982. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> at that time refused to set up headquarters in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> and began looking into the prospects of negotiating peace with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. That angered <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> radicals, who advocated armed struggle against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. In May 1983, the friction exploded into a battle between <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s supporters and Syrian-backed hardliners seeking to oust the guerrilla chief from the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leadership. <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders have been trying to reconcile <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> since the split but <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>'s assassination accelerated the process. The 52-year-old native of <LOCATION> Ramle </LOCATION>, now in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, was respected by both <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> loyalists and pro-Syrian dissidents. He was said to be the mastermind of the Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories and his death was a severe blow to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, underscoring <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s military might.

<HEAD>Contras Threaten Talks Cutoff if Aid Not Delivered</HEAD>

 A Contra leader threatened Monday to end the upcoming peace talks unless the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> immediately allow <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> humanitarian aid to reach the guerrillas, and a top Nicaraguan official met secretly here with the rebels. Contra director <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> said the truce arrangement reached last month in <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, would be in danger if the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> continue to block food and medical supplies to rebel troops inside that Central American country. <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> also acknowledged Monday the contents of an April 10 internal <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> memo obtained by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. His forces' position was `` difficult,'' <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> said, adding that immediate delivery of food and humanitarian supplies must be the first priority in the talks scheduled to begin Thursday in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. The internal memo writen by the <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> field officer known as Cmdr. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said `` we urgently need that humanitarian-type aid be permitted to the troops, who are in a critical situation.'' `` We must reach an agreement on that,'' said <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>. `` If that is not done, the whole <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION> agreement will collapse.'' He said the Contras have three private <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies available to rush the supplies to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> as soon as the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> agree. Some of the aid approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was already on its way to refugee camps on the <LOCATION> Honduran-Nicaraugan </LOCATION> border, he added. And, in preparation for Thursday's top-level negotiations in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, Sandinista Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> arrived secretly in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to discuss `` the agenda and arrangments'' for the talks, <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> confirmed. <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> was to meet at an undisclosed location Monday with the <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> directors' secretary, said <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, but was not expected to meet face-to-face with the five directors. <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> has previously accused the Contras of engaging in political maneuvering to avoid a definitive cease-fire while they receive <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid. `` We have serious doubts they want to enter into a definitive cease-fire,'' <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> on April 13. `` They simply want to move into zones which means gains for them without a threat, with security and to gain the release of 50 percent of the prisoners, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> aid and participation in politics.'' The plight of the troops has been said to be a contributing cause to a reported rift among the Contra leaders, but Monday <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> downplayed the differences among the five directors. He denied leading a movement to fire top military chief <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>, but acknowledged two other rebel field comanders `` Tono'' and `` Fernando'' _ <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Diogenes </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> _ had objected to the peace talks. He also said, when asked about a Contra shakeup, that three top civilian employees of the rebel troops had been replaced by military officials. He insisted, however, that there was still unity among the directors of the Nicaraguan Resistance, as the Contras are formally called. All five directors, including <PERSON> Aristides </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, who skipped the last meeting with the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> for `` personal reasons,'' will fly to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> for this week's negotiations, <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> said. He denied infighting between himself and <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, who some sources say has the backing of <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> and many field commanders, but acknowledged that tactical differences existed among the Contra leaders, just as they did among the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>.

 A couple from <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, have become frequent visitors to <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, handing out fliers, asking questions and checking people and places their missing musician son may have known and visited. `` We keep hoping that we will find him alive but the longer it goes, it makes us worry more that we wo n't,'' says <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Chism </PERSON> about his missing son, <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Chism </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 23. Police found his bloodstained shirt, other clothes and a crowbar covered with blood in a trash bin. His girlfriend's phone number and a bank deposit slip were in the shirt pocket. Blood was found on the back seat of his car. The younger <PERSON> Chism </PERSON> disappeared shortly after calling his parents and girlfriend Feb. 5. His roommate and members of his gospel music group reported him missing Feb. 8. On their first trip to <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Chism </PERSON> and his wife <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> went to motels, shopping centers and other places to look for their son's car. They handed out fliers with information about their son and tried to contact anybody who had known him. The car was found after somebody read a newspaper advertisement that the Chisms placed. In addition to the blood, <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's deputies found <PERSON> Chism </PERSON>'s glasses and boots in the car, his father said. A sheriff's spokesman said samples of the blood were being tested. `` Foul play could be involved, but right now we have n't found a victim,'' said sheriff's spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomons </PERSON>. `` We are doing everything we can. We are working this case diligently.'' <PERSON> Chism </PERSON>'s parents disagree. `` We feel that from the beginning, the police -LRB- sheriff's -RRB- department has not shown a concern for a missing person,'' said the elder <PERSON> Chism </PERSON>, an evangelist. `` That is the reason we have driven miles and miles.'' <PERSON> Solomons </PERSON> disputes the parents' claims. He said the sheriff's office followed standard procedures in handling a missing person report <PERSON> Chism </PERSON>, who played piano in a gospel group known as <PERSON> Loretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and the Sounds of Praise, had planned to leave <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> in March and work with his father in a ministry. For his mother, the worst part is not knowing. `` It's like you ca n't grieve because you do n't know that he is dead and you ca n't go on because you ca n't find him,'' she said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Monday let stand an <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> telephone company's ban on sexually explicit dial-up message services. In the first `` dial-a-porn'' case to reach the high court, the justices without comment declined to hear arguments that <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>'s refusal to carry sexually explicit message services violates free-speech rights. The court's action came a week after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> sent to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> a bill that would ban all dial-a-porn services, which are available to callers through `` 976'' exchanges and <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's `` 900'' long-distance lines. State governments also have been working to limit availability of dial-a-porn services, and last week the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> fined two <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> dial-a-porn companies $ 600,000 each for allegedly failing to prevent children from hearing their messages. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s action `` clearly puts the ball in the phone companies' court,'' said <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> <PERSON> Keirnes </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Decency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Through </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, Ariz.-based public interest law firm specializing in obscenity law. <PERSON> Keirnes </PERSON> said phone companies now have a green light to `` pull the plug on dial-a-porn'' services without fear of violating the companies' First Amendment rights. Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bliley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., who spearheaded the move in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to approve a dial-a-porn ban, said the court's action bolsters his belief that such a ban will withstand a court test `` It indicates the thinking of the court, which is that this kind of speech is not protected by the First Amendment,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> company, was pleased with the decision, but the parent company is not considering extending the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> ban to the 13 other states in its territory, a spokesman said. In <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, dial-a-porn services `` were particularly harmful to our reputation, so we felt that -LRB- a ban -RRB- was the most appropriate action for <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. But there are different circumstances in different states,'' said <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. In its other states, <LOCATION> US </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> is offering customers one-time, free blocking of 976 services, establishing a separate prefix for dial-a-porn services and is no longer billing or collecting for these services. `` We think those will be effective and give parents a tool to keep children from gaining access to these types of services,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> said her company `` will review our position in light of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s action to see if there are direct implications.'' Other Bell companies and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> had no comment on the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> action. <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 banned from its 976 network all businesses that `` provide adult entertainment messages with sexually oriented content.'' The policy was challenged by <ORGANIZATION> Carlin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Sapphire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, as impeding their freedom of speech. Only the government or some agent of the government can violate someone's constitutional rights, so the two companies argued that <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>'s policy represented a `` state action.'' They said that because <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> is a heavily regulated public utility that had been pressured by state authorities to pull the plug on dial-a-porn services, the company's action amounted to an action of the state. A federal trial judge ruled that <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> could not refuse to carry the dial-a-porn messages. But the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> reversed that ruling last year, saying <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>'s action did not amount to a `` state action. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Abelman </PERSON>, representing <PERSON> Carlin </PERSON>, did not return a telephone call for comment. <PERSON> Sapphire </PERSON> is a subsidiary of <PERSON> Carlin </PERSON>. A similar decision by another federal appeals court previously enabled <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> to rid its 976 networks of dial-a-porn services in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Administration Eyes Return to Limited `Rules of Engagement' in

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s spokesman suggested Monday that the administration wants to return <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> to the limited rules of engagement that existed before last week's shooting with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. While emphasizing that no decisions have been made on how American naval power will be used in the wake of last Monday's exchanges with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` Everybody acknowledges that we need to move back to some more limited set of rules. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>'s statement buttressed remarks that Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> made in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials were consulting with <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies on <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> strategy and other issues. `` We will not get tied up in any serious shooting war with the Iranians,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said in an interview on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' show. He said the question of what rules should govern <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military activities in the gulf remained unresolved, saying `` that's the kind of decision that the president makes.'' The tone of the comments by <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> differed with assessments provided late last week by other administration officials. Those officials, who spoke on condition they not be named, had said the administration decided to expand its policy to allow <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships to aid neutral merchant ships under attack. But those officials said the rules of engagement would not be expanded far enough to allow a broad-based <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> escort for non-American-flagged vessels in the gulf. The talk of a change in policy came as a direct result of the mining of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> frigate and last Monday's extensive fighting between Iranian and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces. At the same time, Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, confirmed over the weekend that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials were considering using <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> vessels in the gulf. But on Monday, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> talked of the possibility of returning <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces to the limited rules of engagement that applied before last Monday's clash: rules which provide for measured responses to the laying of mines or other Iranian provocations. Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, had voiced fear about an increasing Americanization of the Iran-Iraq war, and there has been a move in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to revise provisions of the War Powers Act that limit the ability of lawmakers to act <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> consulted with congressional leaders in advance of the military strikes he ordered a week ago, and he wrote a letter calling `` the matter closed'' in the aftermath of the exchanges. But the administration has taken the position that elements of the War Powers Act are unconsitutional, and has refused to invoke a provision that would give lawmakers a chance to vote within 60 days on whether to keep <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in the region. The administration also is consulting members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in connection with a reassessment of the rules of engagement in the gulf. While <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> stressed that several options remain under study in the gulf, he said `` right now the rules of engagement are essentially the same as they were last week, reflecting the emergency nature of the situation. But the question is, where do we move back to? ... I ca n't discuss specifics.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told interviewers that `` as far as our rules of engagement are concerned, what the right ones are for this stage of the game in the gulf are being considered in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, and there is a process of consultation going on, and I think it's premature to describe them in any particular way.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the rules of engagement were expanded a week ago `` to accommodate the military situation that was encountered'' after <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> forces bombarded two Iranian oil platforms in reprisal for the mining of the USS <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> the week before. `` You'll recall at that point that our ships were engaging hostile forces in any number of areas,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` And we now want to move back to our conservative set of rules. And so that decision has to be made about where to move back to. ... `` The rules were changed to accommodate the military aggression that was encountered that day,'' he said. `` Once that is no longer the case, we want to move to something that would be more sustainable in the long term.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> remains officially neutral in the 7 -LCB- - year Iran-Iraq war although it used <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships to guard American-flagged Kuwaiti tankers from attacks since last summer

 Former <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> officer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON>'s luxurious lifestyle and mounting personal debts led him to scheme with two <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> men to defraud the bank, prosecutors said Monday at his trial. `` By the summer of 1981, <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON> lived a lifestyle virtually fit for a king, like the ` lifestyle of the rich and famous,''' Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Helwig </PERSON> contended during closing arguments. <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION> oil driller <PERSON> Jere </PERSON> <PERSON> Sturgis </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, former head of oil and gas lending at the failed <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Square </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, are charged with participating in a scheme to defraud <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> vice president, is accused of taking kickbacks in exchange for funding and attempting to fund high-risk energy loans from <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> customers. The three men have pleaded innocent. <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON>, 52, and <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, 37, are charged with wire fraud and misapplication of bank funds. <PERSON> Sturgis </PERSON>, 40, is charged with wire fraud. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Shadur </PERSON> is presiding over the trial, which is into its sixth week. The indictment cites <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON>'s involvement in $ 44 million in loans made by <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> to 12 Penn Square customers. It does not say how much was recovered by the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> bank, which came to the brink of collapse in 1984 in part because of its troubled energy loans. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> was rescued with a $ 4.5 billion federal bailout. Those loans were approved in 1981 and 1982 _ at about the same time, <PERSON> Helwig </PERSON> charges, that <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON> received nearly $ 600,000 in kickbacks from <LOCATION> Patterson </LOCATION> in the form of unsecured personal loans from <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>. He said <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON>, a 20-year <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> veteran who oversaw the bank's oil and gas lending in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, needed the money because he was living well beyond his means. `` He had a home he was doubling in size, vacations, two vacation homes, and $ 565,000 -LRB- from the <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Square </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- that he used to buy cars, furs, and jewelry. `` He had become so completely dependent on <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, he no longer had the interest of <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> first and foremost,'' <PERSON> Helwig </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON>, impassive during government arguments, took notes. He sat facing the jury, wearing a brown suit and scuffed penny loafers _ one with a hole in the sole.

<HEAD>Chicago Special Mayoral Election Now Could Be Next Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The city board of elections voted Monday to hold a special mayoral election next year if the city clerk declares a vacancy in the mayor's office. <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> has been serving as acting mayor since last November when then-Mayor <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>, the city's first black mayor, died after suffering a massive heart attack in his office. <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> was elected by the City Council, and his supporters contend the next mayoral election should be in 1991, when <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s term would have expired. Under the three-member board's unanimous decision, <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clerk </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozubowski </PERSON> must decide whether a vacancy exists in the mayor's office. Deputy City Clerk <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kozubowski </PERSON> has not decided what to do and would await an opinion from the city's corporation counsel <PERSON> Otis </PERSON> <PERSON> Chism </PERSON>, administrative assistant to the general counsel for the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, said he was not sure what prompted the decision. Supporters of <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, expected to be one of <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>'s chief mayoral challengers in the next election, have been seeking a 1989 election <PERSON> Chism </PERSON> said the matter could end up being settled in court, where two lawsuits are pending. One asks for a 1989 special election, and the other seeks a 1991 vote. The board's vote today followed last week's decision by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> to postpone until May 4 making any recommendations on the question of when the city's next mayoral election should be. <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> said that if an election is held, the city board agreed to Feb. 28 as a primary election date in 1989 with April 4 as a general election date.

 A former top aide has left <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s church to start his own, but says he still loves <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> and is not trying to compete with the defrocked evangelist's ministry. `` We left friends. Brother <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> and I are still friends,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Jerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogg </PERSON> after inaugural services at <ORGANIZATION> Bethel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assemblies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> God </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday. <PERSON> Ogg </PERSON>, who set up <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s foreign crusades and often served as a ministry spokesman, said he still loves <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> World Ministries. `` I've always wanted to pioneer a church,'' said <PERSON> Ogg </PERSON>. `` I'm getting that chance here, but it's going to take time. The 80 worshipers at the first <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Temple </LOCATION> service had to sing from memory because there were no hymn books or church bulletins. <PERSON> Ogg </PERSON> put three small advertisements in local newspapers announcing Sunday's services, but said he is not trying to steal worshipers. `` We will do nothing unethical. We have not called anyone and asked them to come,'' he said. Meanwhile, services at <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s own Family Worship Center were disrupted by a man who said <PERSON> God </PERSON> had sent him with a message: <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> should return to the pulpit immediately. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> is observing a three-month ban on preaching imposed by <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Assemblies of God leaders as part of the punishment for his reported visit to a prostitute. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> left the Assemblies of God after the national church extended the ban to a year. `` Let him preach, man!'' shouted <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hobbs </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>. Ushers escorted <PERSON> Hobbs </PERSON> out In an interview shortly afterward, <PERSON> Hobbs </PERSON> said <PERSON> God </PERSON> told him to drive from <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> to tell <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> `` that -LRB- God -RRB- wants him up on his feet and preaching now.'' <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> laughed and remained seated next to his wife, <PERSON> Frances </PERSON>, during the incident. At <ORGANIZATION> Bethel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Ogg </PERSON> recalled the beginning of <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s church eight years ago `` Some of you were there to start that church with me, too,'' he told the fledgling congregation. `` This will be a wide-open church. We will have an advisory panel for running the church,'' said <PERSON> Ogg </PERSON>, adding that the congregation will vote on major decisions. <PERSON> Ogg </PERSON> will be the pastor of <ORGANIZATION> Bethel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>, with his son <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> as co-pastor. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogg </PERSON> was in charge of the ministry for single men and women at the Family Worship Center.

<HEAD>Is Poem Really By The Bard, or Much Ado About Nothing?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 By thee or not by thee? That was the question which swirled around a poem that an <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor said is by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> but other scholars rejected as false. `` I'm convinced it is by <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION>'s professor of poetry, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Levi </PERSON>, as he held up a photocopy of the untitled poem at the center of the tempest. <PERSON> Levi </PERSON> called a news conference Monday _ four days after his claim emerged in a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> newspaper _ to introduce a 28-page book he has written to prove the poem was written by The Bard. Counters Professor <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Shakespeare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Birmingham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>: `` I do not think for one moment it is by him.'' The controversy had spread to the <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Library </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marino </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, which has the disputed poem. Some experts claim the issue is not new _ that the poem has been known of since 1801 _ and some say it's not up to Shakespearean standards. <PERSON> Levi </PERSON> has support from a manuscript scholar, <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Sams </PERSON>, who says the poem may even be in Shakespeare's handwriting. `` I do n't terribly mind what happens to my reputation,'' said <PERSON> Levi </PERSON>. `` It would be a terrible act of cowardice not to have printed as a poem of Shakespeare what other people were too idle or too silly to notice.'' He said he first read the untitled poem when he asked the Huntington Library for photocopies of several manuscripts for his Shakespeare biography. The poem is pasted in the back of a manuscript volume containing a play by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Marston </PERSON>, a dramatist contemporary of <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>, and bears initials that could be `` WSH'' or `` WSK.'' `` I think it is ` W. Sh.' Otherwise why would <PERSON> Marston </PERSON> have written it?'' <PERSON> Levi </PERSON> said. `` Without that signature I would not have been absolutely certain, but no one disputes that the writing is <PERSON> Marston </PERSON>'s and I believe he was appending the initials of the poem's author.'' Asked why the poem had been neglected since <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> died in 1616, <PERSON> Levi </PERSON> commented: `` I ca n't imagine. The verses have movement like the end of ` The Tempest.' They recall ` As You Like It' and ` <PERSON> Antony </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cleopatra </PERSON>.' `` They are exactly what <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> might have turned out,'' said <PERSON> Levi </PERSON>, 56, who has published 12 books of his own poems and written or edited 25 others. The poem consists of tributes to be spoken by 14 identified ladies presenting gifts to <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandos </PERSON> at her betrothal party in 1607. <PERSON> Levi </PERSON> cited this verse to prove the poem was worthy of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s greatest poet: `` Witty, pretty, virtuous and fair, `` Compounded all of fire and air, `` Sweet, measure not my thought and me `` By golden fruit from fruitless tree. `` That's beautiful. It could be <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> and I think the whole thing is by him,'' the professor said. <PERSON> Levi </PERSON> said he worked from photocopies of the poem `` because I can not afford to jump on a plane to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. I am poorly paid.'' Lord <PERSON> Stockton </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> publishers, handed reporters copies of <PERSON> Levi </PERSON>'s book about the poem, `` A Private Commission: New Verses by <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>.'' `` I regard this as the literary event of the decade and perhaps of the whole period since World War II,'' <PERSON> Stockton </PERSON> said. A.L. <PERSON> Rowse </PERSON>, a renowned Elizabethan scholar, wrote in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Evening </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Monday that the <PERSON> Levi </PERSON> verses were `` quite good _ but they are simple and direct,'' and lack <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s elusiveness and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Knowles </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> research student who independently investigated the poem's authenticity, said he does n't believe <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> wrote it and he will publish his views Friday. `` I am not merely indulging in scholarly skepticism when I say I do not think the verse is <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s,'' said <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>. `` I do not think <PERSON> Levi </PERSON> made anything of a case because he seems to be saying that because it is good, it must be <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s. That is a subjective judgment. `` There were masses of other poets capable of writing good poetry and there were other poets whose initials were WS,'' he said in an interview. <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodson </PERSON>, a curator at the <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>, said the undated <PERSON> Marston </PERSON> book and the inserted poem were dated to the 17th century by the paper, ink, handwriting and binding. `` It has been in the library since 1917 ... At least one other scholar and probably more have wondered about the <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> connection,'' she said.

 A judge sentenced <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> on Monday to die for <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> war crimes and said the retired <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> autoworker personally killed tens of thousands of people as the sadistic death camp guard `` Ivan the Terrible.'' Hundreds of spectators jumped to their feet and applauded. Some shouted `` Bravo!'' and others `` Death! Death!'' Survivors of the Holocaust, in which 6 million Jews were killed, cried and embraced each other. Judge <PERSON> Zvi </PERSON> <PERSON> Tal </PERSON> said <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s crimes at the <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION> death camp in Nazi-occupied <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> could `` never be forgiven by the hearts of men or be obliterated from memory. ... The blood of the victims still cries out to us.'' `` Ivan the Terrible'' operated the gas chambers at <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION>, where 850,000 Jews were killed in 1942-43. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> was convicted last week. The judge, who was born in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and lost his parents in the Holocaust, said <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> `` served as an arch henchman who with his own hands killed tens of thousands of human beings. He humiliated and degraded his victims.'' Minutes before the sentence was read, <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> shouted in Hebrew: `` I'm an innocent man!'' <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>, 68, was in a wheelchair because of back problems. He is a Ukrainian Orthodox Christian and crossed himself repeatedly and muttered, apparently in prayer. The 14-month trial in a converted movie theater was only the second in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> of someone charged with Nazi crimes. More than 250,000 people attended and sessions were broadcast live on radio and television. <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Eichmann </PERSON>, who directed <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s program for exterminating Jews, was tried in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and hanged in 1962. He is the only person to have been executed in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> since it bedcame a nation in 1948. Court spokesman <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> also probably would be executed by hanging `` if the sentence is upheld on appeal.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the defendant's 22-year-old son, sobbed silently. He said the family had expected a death sentence and would appeal within days. `` This amounts to nothing more than the judicial murder of an innocent man,'' he said. `` It will bring shame to the state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the Israeli <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and most unfortunately the 6 million victims of the Nazi Holocaust,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> extradited <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Lorain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, the Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruchok </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ukrainian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> said: `` It's a travesty of justice.'' <PERSON> Bruchok </PERSON> met the defendant when the family asked for a priest shortly before <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> was sent to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` I saw his face,'' <PERSON> Bruchok </PERSON> said. `` I saw the face of a gentle man who was scared. An innocent man is being executed. I believe this with all my heart. It is very unfortunate.'' <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Czarny </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION> survivor who testified for the prosecution, said: `` A thousand deaths can not compensate for what happened ... but at least we have judged one of the angels of death.'' <PERSON> Pinchas </PERSON> <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON>, another survivor who testified, hugged a relative and said: `` I feel like a burden was lifted.'' Earlier in the day, <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> told the court in a calm, clear voice: `` You have made a grave mistake. ... I do not deserve this. I am innocent, innocent, innocent. God is my witness.'' `` In the 20th century how is it possible for such an injustice to be done?'' he asked in Ukrainian. `` I am not <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> the Terrible, and to that God is the most just witness. He knows I am innocent.'' Prosecutor <PERSON> Yonah </PERSON> <PERSON> Blattman </PERSON> said in his argument for the death penalty that <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> `` was not a small cog in the Nazi machine, he was a major criminal.'' <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> pointed to his chest and repeatedly shook his head to <PERSON> Blattman </PERSON>'s allegations that he `` distinguished himself by the sheer brutality of his behavior. ... He cut off breasts, slashed faces, beat in skulls.'' He crossed himself each time <PERSON> Blattman </PERSON> mentioned an atrocity, causing murmurs among the 650 spectators. Defense lawyer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> said new evidence might come to light that would prove his client innocent, and cited cases of wrongful conviction. `` The death penalty is an irrevocable penalty imposed by fallible judges. `` Let not a second crime happen. ... The taking of any innocent human life is a Holocaust,'' he said, and there were gasps from the audience. After the sentencing, ashen-faced, <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> was ringed by police guards and wheeled from the courtroom. He shouted to reporters before reaching a police van: `` I'm an innocent man!! I'm not ` Ivan the Terrible'! I do n't care what they -LRB- the court -RRB- did!'' <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> bumped his head as guards lifted him into the van. He could be seen slumped in the wheelchair as the vehicle drove past jeering spectators.

<HEAD>White House Regrets Gorbachev's Reaction to Reagan Speech</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The White House said Monday it regretted that Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has taken strong exception to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s `` accurate'' and `` realistic'' assessment of U.S.-Soviet relations. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> acknowledged that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s comments, contained in a speech delivered Thursday in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, had irritated the Soviet leader in advance of the May 29-June 3 <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit. According to a report by the Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> complained to Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> about the president's speech during a meeting last week in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> took <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to task for criticizing Soviet policy in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and on human rights, the report said. In his speech, the president questioned whether the Soviets had abandoned `` ambitions'' to control <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and threaten <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, despite the recent <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accord outlining the Soviet pullout. He also said the Soviets could `` never have truly normal relations'' with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as long as it violated human rights. `` President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s comments on East-West relations in his <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, speech obviously struck a raw nerve with the general secretary,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said when asked about <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s comments `` The very harsh rhetoric used by <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> to describe the president's speech is most unfortunate. We trust it does not signal a move away from the steadily improving relations that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has espoused in its recent past,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. The spokesman contended that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s comments signaled no change in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy and defended the speech as `` accurate in terms of the way we view Soviet intentions'' in countries such as <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said there have been `` significant improvements'' in U.S.-Soviet relations in recent years, particularly in the area of arms control, but he added that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` will continue to be realistic, ... will continue to point out problems as well as positive developments.'' Asked by reporters why it had been appropriate for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to use tough language in describing Soviet actions, but not for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to do the same, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` It seemed needlessly inflammatory.'' But at another point, the spokesman said the Soviets `` have a right to say anything they want.'' Asked if the administration was pleased it had `` struck a raw nerve'' with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s speech, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> replied, `` I do n't regret that it struck a nerve, but I regret that it has caused this kind of personal feelings and trading of harsh language.'' The spokesman said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` wants to be realistic in terms of our relations, especially as we approach a fourth summit. `` As the president said in his speech, a major test of Soviet intentions is how they conduct their regional political affairs, and he's simply saying that's going to be a part of our discussion,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. He said it was <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s intention to `` point out the major issues that divide us, and that two superpowers need to discuss openly and frankly at summits. `` We think its a healthy sign that both countries are willing to face up to the realities of their problems in a summit atmosphere,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> added. Asked if the situation might put a strain on the upcoming summit between <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, he said, `` I hope not. You just never know.''

 Seven days a week when it's sunny, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasselhan </PERSON> sits alone in a closet-sized room 100 feet in the air and stares into space. But if a puff of smoke appears, the fire tower observer must quickly spot it, plot its location with help from another tower and report in by short-wave radio. And in the heart of forest fire season, <PERSON> Hasselhan </PERSON> may do that several times a day. From March 15 to May 15, when humidity is low and leaves have not yet covered bare trees to provide shade, the warming sun may spontaneously ignite the dry forest floor, said <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrini </PERSON>, an assistant warden with the state Division of Parks, Forestry and Recreation. <PERSON> Hasselhan </PERSON>'s job may seem monotonous, but his window-lined `` office'' has one of the finest views in all of southern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. It also sways in the wind. `` Sometimes it gets boring, sometimes it gets very busy,'' the 33-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Atco </ORGANIZATION> resident said. `` A lot of times you just sit here. On rainy days, you either go home or down to the shop to help work on the fire trucks.'' Tower watchers put in lighter hours during the summer, then go back to the seven-day-a-week routine for about a month in autumn when leaves fall and dry out. They spend the winter in the forestry department shop building new fire trucks from the frame up. The job pays $ 14,000 to $ 20,000 a year. The curious sometimes ask to visit the towers, and <PERSON> Hasselhan </PERSON> never stops them. `` A lot of them reach the third flight and ca n't make it because they get scared of the height,'' he said. At 9:45 a.m. each day, <PERSON> Hasselhan </PERSON> checks the weather gauges at the foot of the tower. Then, after catching his breath from the long climb up the staircase, he checks in with <PERSON> Petrini </PERSON> in the Division C office in Mays Landing. Division C covers still-forested sections of southern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> including the <ORGANIZATION> Pinelands </ORGANIZATION> and has six towers, built in the 1930s, scanning a total of roughly 100,000 acres, <PERSON> Petrini </PERSON> said. Division A handles the northwestern corner of the state, and Division B has towers covering forests in the middle of the state. As of Monday, more than 257 fires, most of them minor, have been doused in Division C, covering the state's six southern-most counties. A sheet on the tower's wall lists nearby industries and power plants that emit smoke. <PERSON> Hasselhan </PERSON> points to a white cloud in the distance and explains it is from an asphalt plant. `` I know the difference after sitting up here all this time,'' he said. `` You know what smoke looks like. A house fire does n't move and looks black A woods fire changes color and changes direction.'' When <PERSON> Hasselhan </PERSON> spots smoke, he immediately calls another tower to confirm it. They then locate the smoke with a surveying device and call the warden, who sends out a firefighting team. <PERSON> Hasselhan </PERSON> has been a fire tower observer for almost four years. The novelty of having a `` terrific view'' wore off quickly, he said. But the tower is just a preliminary stop in his career. `` I'd rather be out fighting fires,'' he said.

 A paint store erupted in flames with a pair of explosions, forcing panicked residents to jump from upstairs apartment windows into the arms of bystanders as firefighters fought to control the blaze early Monday. A dozen people were injured in the fire that destroyed the store building and badly damaged three other buildings, but only one was admitted to a hospital. However, the blaze was so intense that rescuers initially were convinced there would be fatalities and the Fire Department ordered 25 body bags sent to the scene. `` People that were in the building, some of them on the third floor, they said they felt the building drop,'' said Deputy Fire Chief <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>. `` The north wall dropped out and they jumped to their safety. And nobody was seriously injured that I know of.'' `` It was very fortunate,'' he said. `` They must have had a friend upstairs.'' The fire began with an explosion at the paint store at 11:13 p.m. Sunday, fire officials said. Within minutes after the first firefighters arrived, a second, more powerful explosion ripped through the paint store, blowing out one wall and creating a fireball that rapidly spread to nearby structures. <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> McMurray </PERSON>, 33, and <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, 44, were sitting at a dining table in a third-floor apartment above the store. `` The floor went right out beneath us,'' Ms. <PERSON> McMurray </PERSON> said. `` Everything in the kitchen was shaking. He -LRB- Bell -RRB- had me by the hand and pulled me down the stairs. It took us 20 seconds to get out the front door, but the smoke was really intense. `` By the time we got to the second floor it was really hot. As soon as we got outside, it went poof. It just went poof.'' <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON> <PERSON> Boatman </PERSON>, who was at a bar a block and a half away, said several bar patrons left with her and began shouting outside to awaken people in the neighborhood. She said several people joined together to catch residents who jumped from windows when the building began collapsing. `` I opened the window and some people were shouting to me. I just jumped and they caught me,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bedwell </PERSON>, 24, who jumped from the second flood in his underwear. `` There was no fire yet, but then <PERSON> David </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Bedwell </PERSON> -RRB- jumped out ... and others saw him and began jumping too,'' Ms. <PERSON> Boatman </PERSON> said. It took five hours for 165 firefighters using 30 pieces of equipment to bring the fire under control. Authorities predicted it would be some time before investigators determined the cause. The only person hospitalized was <PERSON> Jae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahn </PERSON>, 31, listed in fair condition with a spinal injury she suffered when she jumped from her second-story apartment. `` The floor exploded, and at the same time the ceiling collapsed down,'' said her husband, <PERSON> Young </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahn </PERSON>, a foreign exchange student at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin-Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ahn </PERSON> lowered himself out a window using an electrical cord, but it broke and he fell to the ground. His wife then jumped holding the couple's 23-month-old daughter in her arms. The child suffered only scrapes to the face. Aside from destroying the paint store and the apartments above it, the fire also damaged a duplex next door, and two taverns. Twenty-eight people were left homeless, and all received assistance from the Milwaukee chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>.

 A $ 10,000 bond could n't hold a man who has since been accused of 194 counts of burglary, so a judge has multiplied the defendant's bond by 1,000 _ to $ 10 million.

In addition to the burglary charges, <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> is being held on counts of second-degree battery, auto theft and resisting an officer, booking records show.

<HEAD>Senate OKs Compensation for Veterans Claiming Radiation-Caused
Cancers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 48-30 approval Monday of a bill granting new benefits to an estimated 250,000 `` atomic veterans'' who were exposed to radiation during the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear attacks on <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in 1945 and in post-war nuclear tests. The bill still requires <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approval, but the measure faces a veto threat from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> if it reaches his desk. `` It is time to be fair to these men,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and chief sponsor of the bill The measure would cost an estimated $ 36 million in its first year to pay for medical treatments. The atomic veterans are service personnel who either took part in the occupation of <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION> after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> atomic bombs were dropped on those Japanese cities in August 1945, or who took part in open-air tests of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> atomic weapons in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> during the two decades after the war. Many of those veterans have developed cancer and have urged the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to make a presumptive finding that their cancers are related to their exposure to radiation during the tests. Many of the servicemen were exposed to radiation during the tests with little or no protective clothing. The bill would include 13 specific types of cancer. Under existing law, veterans with cancer can receive compensation, but in each case, they must show that the illness is service-related. Only 28 of the nearly 5,000 veterans who have filed radiation-related claims with the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> have been approved for disability benefits. Originally, the bill passed Monday was part of a larger health and compensation bill for the nation's 27.4 million veterans. But the `` atomic veterans'' measure was so strongly opposed by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration that it was dropped because of a veto threat issued by the White House. Administration officials argue there is no scientific basis for presuming that the 13 types of cancers were caused by exposure to radiation during military service. Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, R-Wyo., said the bill `` just ignores sound, medical scientific evidence ... It's just an absurd approach toward compensation.

 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed and sent to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Monday a bill providing for the prompt return of children abducted from a parent and taken to another country, often by the other parent.

 Premier <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, desperate for votes in the election runoff against President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, rallied conservative forces Monday but still refused to deal with the extreme-right <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. Nearly all political analysis focused on <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>'s need to attract supporters from <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Jean-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON>, who won a stunning 14.4 percent of the vote in Sunday's first-round. The premier, head of the neo-Gaullist Rally for the Republic party, garnered only 19.9 percent of the vote. He was far behind the president who led all challengers with 34 percent. <PERSON> Mitterand </PERSON>, a Socialist, is heavily favored to win a second seven-year term in the May 8 runoff. The <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> campaign announced a televised debate between the premier and the 71-year-old <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> had been scheduled for Thursday, an encounter they believe can only help <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>. By Monday afternoon, 99 percent of the vote had been counted, lacking only returns from <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Polynesia </LOCATION>. Former center-right Premier <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Barre </PERSON>, 64, who finished third with 16.6 percent, immediately threw his support behind <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, 55, and called on his voters to do the same. On Monday, the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, which had backed <PERSON> Barre </PERSON>, also gave <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> its endorsement. It was not clear, however, how many of <PERSON> Barre </PERSON> supporters would actually vote for <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>. Polls indicate a significant number could cross over to <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, who has moved markedly to the center since becoming president in 1981. <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON>, 59, whose campaign focused on curbing immigration and crime, said he would wait until a major <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> rally May 1 to announce what counsel he would give his voters. If <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> wants his votes, <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> said, he will have to announce `` concrete acts in the area of housing, in the area of subsidies to immigrants ... and also in the area of family allocations.'' One of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>'s main arguments is that immigrants are taking French jobs, overburdening the French welfare system and making less money available to help needy <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> citizens. `` It is up to <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> ... to define what electoral majority is possible for him,'' <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> said. `` Then we will see if that jibes with what we feel it should be.'' <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> said the vote of his supporters depended on their individual choice, but he added: `` It is certain that if I give a warm counsel, it has a good chance of being widely followed.'' <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> called a meeting of his Cabinet on Monday and told them: `` It goes without saying that no negotiation will be held with anybody.'' Nonetheless, the subject of immigration is popping up with increasing frequency in the remarks of both <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> and his aides. `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> -RRB- already has taken on <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON>'s themes and ideas,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jean-Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Queyranne </PERSON>. `` Will he also take the men and allow them ministerial portfolios?'' <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> noted that Sunday's voting carried a message: `` It is up to the -LRB- conservative -RRB- candidate to respond to the preoccupations of the French people, to their expectations, to their hopes such as they have been expressed -LRB- by the vote -RRB-.'' <PERSON> Alain </PERSON> <PERSON> Juppe </PERSON>, budget minister and spokesman for the <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> campaign, said the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> performance was a message that was based on three or four ideas. `` The first is that immigration is a problem of <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> society today and that we perhaps have not done enough in this area and that we must tackle the problem with respect to our values and our convictions,'' he said. <PERSON> Juppe </PERSON> said <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> must `` rally a wide range of the French to avoid a new period of Socialism, of laxness and undoubted decline and political troubles for <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Leotard </PERSON>, <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>'s culture minister, said the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> has indicated that `` things that are totally unacceptable for the immense majority of French, and things which can be discussed.'' `` Let us try to make the distinction between all of that, but without negotiating anything whatever with anybody. Xenophobia and racism are not for us.'' <PERSON> Lionel </PERSON> <PERSON> Jospin </PERSON>, first secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said the voters had shown Sunday that `` <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> does not inspire confidence. They do n't think that he can be president.''

<HEAD>Shultz Tells Denmark To Meet Responsibilities Under NATO</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> on Monday urged <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> to `` measure up'' to its <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> responsibilities and to stop a resolution that would effectively ban allied ships from Danish ports. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> met with Danish Foreign Minister <PERSON> Uffe </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellemann-Jensen </PERSON> to restate <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concerns about a <ORGANIZATION> Danish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> motion which demands that visiting warships not carry nuclear arms into Danish harbors. `` It constitutes a real problem,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said of the April 14 motion. <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s minority center-right government opposed the measure and has called for early elections May 10. `` If you like the benefits -LRB- of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> membership -RRB- ... then you ought to like the responsibilities that go with making that possible,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. He met with <PERSON> Ellemann-Jensen </PERSON> after briefing <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers on his talks last week in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> with Soviet leaders. The talks were held to prepare for the May 29-June 2 summit meeting between President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said prospects for a treaty by then to halve <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet strategic nuclear arms were dim. `` It's extremely difficult to get there. There are hard issues to get at. They involve a lot of pick-and-shovel work,'' he said. The issues deal with verification of compliance and counting different arms systems under a Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told reporters at <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> headquarters. He said he would continue negotiating after the summit in the last months of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. `` We'll keep at it, we're not going to stop,'' he said, citing `` broad bipartisan support'' for a START accord in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He denied superpower relations had slumped since last year's signing of a treaty to remove hundreds of medium-range nuclear missiles from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> Citing <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s decision to withdraw its troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said, `` I think the picture is one in which we see general progress.'' <PERSON> Ellemann-Jensen </PERSON> said his government was looking to the May 10 elections for an answer to the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> problem. `` We want to get a clear message from our voters that they want <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> to remain a full member of the alliance,'' he said. `` If we get the signal from the voters we are asking for it will be possible to reach a fair solution.'' That means <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> would stick by its current ban on nuclear arms on its soil but would not demand a declaration from visiting ships, he said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and British warships, as a matter of policy, never say if their warships carry nuclear arms. The Danish resolution has led <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to suspend visits to <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> vessels. <PERSON> Ellemann-Jensen </PERSON> said, `` Both the Americans and the British have made it clear many times it would be necessary to discuss the full participation of <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> in military matters if we'' effectively banned allied warships from these two countries. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said the parliamentary resolution, while an internal Danish matter, has NATO-wide implications. <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> also formally bans nuclear arms from its territory and there have been calls there for a motion similar to the one in <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> bans the basing of allied troops on its soil in peacetime, relying on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to reinforce its territory in times of crisis. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> membership yields benefits but `` it also entails responsibilities. The two things go together and it is up to all of us to measure up as best as we can to our responsibilities.''

<HEAD>Study: Acid Rain Contributing To Death Of Marine Life</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Acid rain's `` sewage from the sky'' is an important and unrecognized contributor to the death of marine life in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> estuaries and coastal waters, an environmental group said Monday. Nitrate compounds originating in the atmosphere, mostly as nitric acid, appear to contribute about 25 percent of total nitrogen flowing into <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> in a report by staff scientists. Ammonium compounds from the atmosphere, mostly originating in the evaporation of manure, contribute another 14 percent of the bay's nitrogen load, the report said. The damage comes not from the acidity, which is immediately neutralized by salt water, but from the overload of nutrients provided by nitrates and ammonium. These fertilizers encourage `` blooms'' of algae that use up oxygen dissolved in the water, making it difficult for other plants and fish to live, and cut off light necessary for bottom-anchored plants to grow. By contrast, the fund estimated the nitrogen contribution from fertilizer runoff at 34 percent, municipal and industrial discharges at 23 percent and direct runoff from animal waste at 4 percent. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Oppenheimer </PERSON>, an atmospheric scientist on the fund staff and one of the study's authors, said, `` This should change forever our view of the acid rain problem,'' showing that `` sewage from the sky'' in the form of nitrogen compounds are a major pollutant of inshore waters. Although the fund's scientists concentrated on <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, they said there was evidence these airborne compounds also are contributing to problems in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Albemarle-Pamlico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> Sound between <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bight </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> off <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. Nationwide, a little more than 21 million tons of nitrogen oxides are emitted from all sources, about one third from motor vehicle exhausts, one third from power plant smokestacks and one seventh from industrial boilers. The fund said it had provided the first estimate of how much of the nitrogen flowing into the bay originates in the atmosphere, both as runoff into streams and as direct precipitation on the bay's surface. The fund's estimate of 154,000 tons of nitrogen compounds flowing into the bay from all sources was higher than the 110,000 estimated by the federal-state <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> pollution control program for an average year, but within the range of that program's estimates of 92,000 tons for a dry year to 198,000 tons for a wet year The joint program has set a goal of reducing nitrogen loading on the bay by 40 percent, and the fund's report said a 40 percent reduction should be aimed for in airborne nitrogen. Oppenheimer called for enactment of one of the acid rain control bills pending before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, saying, `` With the exception of new auto controls, the states on the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seaboard </LOCATION> can begin this program on their own, but they can not finish it. ... A strong federal role is absolutely necessary.'' <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Beck </PERSON>, environment manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, the major trade association of private utilities, said nitrogen oxides from his industry were declining. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> had not had a chance to study the fund's report and thus could not comment immediately. The report kicks off three days of rallies, press conferences and other events by environmental groups seeking an acid rain control program that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration opposes on the grounds that not enough is known to justify it. The activity is timed to coincide with the visit of Canadian Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>, who also is seeking a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> program because half the acid rain falling in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> originates in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Two Blacks Convicted Of Murder In 1985 Land Mine Blasts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two alleged African National <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas were convicted of murder Monday in connection with land mine explosions that killed seven people in 1985. One of the defendants, <PERSON> Mzondileli </PERSON> <PERSON> Nondula </PERSON>, was found guilty of planting a mine that killed two white woman and four white children as they drove in a pickup truck near the <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> border in December 1985. His co-defendant, <PERSON> Mthetheleli </PERSON> <PERSON> Mncube </PERSON>, was convicted of laying a mine that killed a black farm worker in the same area in November 1985. <PERSON> Mncube </PERSON> also was convicted of murdering two white policemen while trying to escape following his arrest in 1986. Both defendants pleaded innocent. Defense lawyers are scheduled to present arguments Tuesday in an effort to avoid death sentences for the pair. Evidence presented during a six-month trial in the northern town of <PERSON> Messina </PERSON> indicated that both men received military training at <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> facilities in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>, outlawed in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, has waged a bombing and sabotage campaign since 1961 aimed at ending white-minority rule. <PERSON> Mncube </PERSON> described himself during the trial as `` an <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> soldier,'' but both he and <PERSON> Nondula </PERSON> said they were tortured by police before signing confessions. In a separate development Monday, the state-run <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported that a black policeman was shot dead by an unknown assailant near <LOCATION> Newcastle </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> Natal </LOCATION> province. The broadcasting company said investigators found cartridges at the scene from a Soviet-made AK-47 automatic rifle _ a weapon which authorities say is used by <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas. Black policemen have been frequent targets of militants who consider them collaborators with the white-led government. By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> is conducting a joint excavation with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at a site where an American plane is believed to have crashed during the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced Monday. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Lao officials have been surveying the site in recent days, and the full <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> excavation team is expected in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> later this week, according to the statement. The digging will take seven to 10 days. This is the third joint excavation as part of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attempts to account for 555 servicemen missing in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> for over 15 years. The two previous ones took place in February 1985 and February 1986, and a number of remains were retrieved. <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>' communist government agreed last August to resume efforts to account for MIAs after apparently suspending them since the 1986 excavation. In return, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has pledged to respond to <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>' calls for humanitarian assistance. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government appreciates this further step by the Lao government in our cooperative effort to resolve the issue of Americans sitll missing or otherwise unaccounted for in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> as a result of the war,'' the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. Department spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said she did not know where the current excavation would take place. The previous two were in <LOCATION> Savannakhet </LOCATION> and Saravane provinces, <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>' southern panhandle area between <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. Many of the MIAs in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> were airmen shot down on missions against the <ORGANIZATION> Ho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trail </ORGANIZATION>, which North Vietnamese communist forces used to ferry men and supplies to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Contras Threaten Talks Cutoff if Aid Not Delivered</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Contra leader threatened Monday to end the upcoming peace talks unless the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> immediately allow <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> humanitarian aid to reach the guerrillas, and a top Nicaraguan official met secretly here with the rebels. Contra director <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> said the truce arrangement reached last month in <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, would be in danger if the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> continue to block food and medical supplies to rebel troops inside that Central American country. <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> also acknowledged Monday the contents of an April 10 internal <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> memo obtained by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. His forces' position was `` difficult,'' <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> said, adding that immediate delivery of food and humanitarian supplies must be the first priority in the talks scheduled to begin Thursday in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. The internal memo writen by the <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> field officer known as Cmdr. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said `` we urgently need that humanitarian-type aid be permitted to the troops, who are in a critical situation.'' `` We must reach an agreement on that,'' said <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>. `` If that is not done, the whole <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION> agreement will collapse.'' He said the Contras have three private <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies available to rush the supplies to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> as soon as the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> agree. Some of the aid approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was already on its way to refugee camps on the <LOCATION> Honduran-Nicaraugan </LOCATION> border, he added. And, in preparation for Thursday's top-level negotiations in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, Sandinista Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> arrived secretly in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to discuss `` the agenda and arrangments'' for the talks, <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> confirmed. <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> was to meet at an undisclosed location Monday with the <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> directors' secretary, said <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, but was not expected to meet face-to-face with the five directors. <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> has previously accused the Contras of engaging in political maneuvering to avoid a definitive cease-fire while they receive <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid. `` We have serious doubts they want to enter into a definitive cease-fire,'' <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> on April 13. `` They simply want to move into zones which means gains for them without a threat, with security and to gain the release of 50 percent of the prisoners, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> aid and participation in politics.'' The plight of the troops has been said to be a contributing cause to a reported rift among the Contra leaders, but Monday <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> downplayed the differences among the five directors. He denied leading a movement to fire top military chief <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>, but acknowledged two other rebel field comanders `` Tono'' and `` Fernando'' _ <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Diogenes </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> _ had objected to the peace talks. He also said, when asked about a Contra shakeup, that three top civilian employees of the rebel troops had been replaced by military officials. He insisted, however, that there was still unity among the directors of the Nicaraguan Resistance, as the Contras are formally called. All five directors, including <PERSON> Aristides </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, who skipped the last meeting with the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> for `` personal reasons,'' will fly to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> for this week's negotiations, <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> said. He denied infighting between himself and <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, who some sources say has the backing of <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> and many field commanders, but acknowledged that tactical differences existed among the Contra leaders, just as they did among the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Lyng Decries EEC Intransigence Over Farm Subsidies Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> has to get serious about seeking solutions to `` an increasingly chaotic condition'' in global agricultural trade or risk being blamed by other trading countries, <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said Monday. But the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> `` is unwilling to even define a long-term goal in the reform of the rules of international trade,'' <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said. `` They term our proposal to eventually eliminate trade-distorting subsidies as ` unrealistic' or ` too far, too fast.' Yet, they have not stated what alternative they will accept.'' <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> warned that failure to make progress in the negotiations by the time of the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> midterm review in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> next December `` will bring into question the change for eventual success'' of the so-called <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> Round. `` I'm not pessimistic, but I'll have to admit there's not whole lot to be optimistic about at this point,'' <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said. He added: `` I think the European Community, unless they show some willingness to even discuss with us -LRB- their long-term objectives -RRB- are going to wake up having the problem of failure of these -LRB- talks -RRB- tossed in their laps. I think that will be unpopular throughout the world. I know it will be, and I suspect they might begin to come around a little bit.'' It has been almost a year and a half since the new <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> Round of multinational trade talks began under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>. Yet, <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said, the major agricultural shippers are expanding export subsidies, rather than reducing them. <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>, for example, has just paid a subsidy equal to $ 126 per metric ton to wheat exporters, and continues to pay `` huge subsidies on a host of other commodities,'' including mixed feed, $ 291 per ton; durum wheat, $ 281 per ton; and barley, $ 130 per ton. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, he told a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, is calling for agricultural trade reform at the <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> Round. Ultimately, under the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal, international trade barriers and subidies would be eliminated over a period of 10 years or so. <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said the `` excessive influence of governments in farm product markets leads to a grossly inefficient allocation of resources in developed countries and leave poorer, developing countries in economic shambles.'' The worst offenders are the big nations `` who are unwilling or reluctant to change,'' he said. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, with huge trade surpluses from exports of industrial and consumer goods, clings to import barriers on products such as beef, rice and citrus. Other exporting countries, including the 12-nation EEC, say they are not alone in subsidizing agricultural trade and point to the Export Enhancement Program operated by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>. Under <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION>, as it is known, private exporters are given surplus USDA-owned commodities so they can sell grain or other products to selected foreign countries, including the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and others. Department officials claim <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> was necessary to compete with <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s subsidized exports.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> plans to pour as much as $ 3 million into <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and spend the better part of a month campaigning there in an all-out effort to win in the nation's most populous state, his campaign chairman said Monday. `` <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> will be a major player in the presidential sweepstakes,'' said <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Assembly Speaker <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who heads up <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s national presidential campaign. Noting that it is virtually impossible for either <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> or <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to get the necessary 2,081 delegates to win the nomination before <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s June 7 primary, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said, `` No matter what happens between now and then, we are a player.'' With his eye on the state's 314 delegates, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> will campaign in <LOCATION> Calfornia </LOCATION> from May 5 through May 28, making only about two forays to other states during that time, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> told reporters during a visit to the capital. For the first time in the campaign, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> may be able to compete financially because his fund raising has picked up tremendously, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` In every place <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has been a candidate he has been outspent three or four or five to one. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> is a media-oriented market. The way our money is coming in for us now, it's clear we are going to be better than competitive in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has led the Democratic field in fund raising and spending since the beginning of the primary season, but during March he was not far ahead of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, raising $ 2.4 million to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s $ 2 million. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is counting on winning votes from groups that have supported him in other states, including peace activists, environmentalists and gay voters, as well as his strong black constituency, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. The battle for the state's sizable Hispanic population is expected to be intense, with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> bringing in former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Toney </PERSON> <PERSON> Anaya </PERSON> and former state health director <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Obledo </PERSON> to campaign for him. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> speaks fluent Spanish and has done well among Hispanics in other states. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said that if <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> does well among his constituent groups and can double the white vote that he got in 1984, he `` is in a position to spring a surprise in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s campaign also hopes to get <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to participate in joint appearances and debates, but so far only one debate is scheduled in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> is an issue-based state with such regional concerns as offshore drilling, timber harvesting and coastal protection, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is a lot smarter than you think,'' he said. `` He is already hip on those issues.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> sought to undo recent comments he made about <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> being a vice presidential prospect if he does not win the presidential nomination. He said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is running for president only. He said that in answering questions from reporters about the second spot on the Democratic ticket, `` sometimes we're not as judicious in our answers as we should be.'' He said he knew of no conversations between <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> aides and the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> camp about the vice presidential issue.

<TEXT>
 Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said Monday he could conceive of situations where he would grant safe passage to hostage-takers, saying `` I choose negotiation over blind bloody confrontation.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> rejected what he called `` material concessions'' to terrorists but did not rule out political accommodation `` If we are going to deter terrorism, we must address the underlying causes of terrorism,'' he said after an appearance at a high school in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. `` Terrorism does not emerge out of the blue.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> met later with Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> as he prepared for Tuesday's <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> primary but the candidate was beseiged with questions stemming from a statement he made Sunday. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said then he disagreed with rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' position that `` we should not negotiate with terrorists. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, `` I disagree with that; If I could get the hostages out, I'd do it. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said Monday that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government will `` talk to anyone, to any group, to any government about the well-being and release of the Americans still held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' She added, `` We will not make concessions to terrorists or compromise our fundamental principles.'' But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> insisted, `` The fact is that our government has talked with terrorists and has negotiated, in some instances successfully. It is good as a policy, but there must be always flexibility in the policy. ... We ought to take every initiative we can to gain the freedom of the American hostages in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he believed it made sense to talk with terrorists because no one else has direct control over the hostages. `` The reason that we must keep open to talking with terrorists, or any enemy, is because in the final analysis terrorists, our enemy, are the only ones who have the ability and power to end the terror and declare peace. ... We must talk to them or find out what their underlying grievances are about.'' He noted that as a private citizen, he talked with the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> before making efforts on behalf of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> hostages to make sure he was not contradicting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy. `` The first principle is that we should not jeopardize our national interests or national security,'' he said. He said he would not make `` material concessions'' to terrorists, a term he defined that as `` giving something physical.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said in certain circumstances, he might be persuaded to grant hostages safe passage and freedom from prosecution in exchange for hostages. `` We did it to gain the freedom of the hostages in the <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> airliner and I think it was the right thing to do,'' he said. He was referring to the 1985 hijacking of a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jet in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. He also used the <LOCATION> Attica </LOCATION> prison uprising in 1971 as an example. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said then <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON> `` charged and there was nothing left but blood. I choose negotiation over blind bloody confrontation.'' It was <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s talks with Syrian leaders that led to the release of captured <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> flyer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> in 1984.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is flexing its conservative muscle, resurrecting fears among liberals that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> may have succeeded in pushing the court to the right. In a move that sparked sharp criticism and dire predictions from opponents, a 5-4 court majority said Monday it is thinking about overturning a 1976 decision considered a key civil rights victory. The ruling 12 years ago, never undone by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, interpreted a Civil War-era law as permitting lawsuits for monetary damages against private businesses and individuals over alleged racial discrimination. The decision in <PERSON> Runyon </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> McCrary </PERSON>, adopted in hundreds of lower court cases since, has become what one civil rights lawyer called `` a major strand of the civil rights enforcement infrastructure.'' Four justices said Monday's announcement could shake minorities' faith in the court `` Time alone will tell whether the erosion of faith is unnecessarily precipitous,'' said Justice <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, a swing vote who most often sides with the court's liberals. `` But in the meantime some of the harm that will flow from today's order may never be completely undone.'' <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Glasser </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, agreed. `` The message is there's a new court and previous rulings are up for grabs,'' he said. `` If this decision possibly can be overturned, perhaps a lot more are endangered.'' The court's three <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> appointees _ Justices <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> _ joined Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> and <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> in voting to restudy the 1976 decision. Joining <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> in dissent were Justices <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, the court's leading liberals; and Justice <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON>, another swing vote. Will there be five votes to overturn the 1976 precedent? <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON>, long the court's most conservative member, and <PERSON> White </PERSON>, a conservative with a generally liberal voting record in civil rights cases, dissented from the 1976 decision. They are two likely votes to overturn. <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> is considered as conservative as <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON>, and a third vote to overturn. The keys may be the votes of <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, who in recent years has shown greater independence from the court's conservative bloc, and <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, whose impact to date has been minimal because he only joined the court in February. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> won <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s nomination of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> was rejected. <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>'s critics in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and among civil rights organizations said they feared his replacing centrist <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> on the court could threaten 30 years of civil rights precedents. In its first seven years, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has had little success persuading the court to adopt the president's conservative agenda: outlawing abortion, restoring prayers in public schools and curtailing affirmative action <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, whose views on such matters are unknown, is viewed as a staunch conservative but less ideological than <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>. The concerns voiced during the <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> nomination fight were echoed Monday, however. Calling <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> the key to a `` new court,'' the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Glaser </PERSON> said, `` <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> had an extensive record of civil rights animus and <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> did not. But this is n't encouraging.''

<HEAD>Study Faults Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Investigative Office</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission needs to improve its investigative office to ensure that its work is done competently and professionally, according to a congressional study released Monday. `` The important mission and critical safety role of the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> require that it possess a first-rate investigative capability,'' the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said in the study, which was released by the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative wing of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said the study was based on the review of three investigations made within the nuclear agency. <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said that in two cases, the work done by the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>'s office and inspector and auditor was not thorough enough One case involved allegations by an <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> inspector that superiors had pressured him to change findings in 1986 about safety conditions at the <ORGANIZATION> Comanche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The other involved alleged improper discussions in 1986 between <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Stello </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>'s executive director of operations, and <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Authority </LOCATION>'s NRC-regulated nuclear program. <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said its review supported the findings of <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> investigators who said neither matter was improper. But in both cases <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> investigators had not interviewed individuals with key roles. The third case looked into <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>'s investigation of how a copy of an internal <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> document turned up in 1985 in the files of the <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Waterford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> III </ORGANIZATION> plant _ along with a memo from <ORGANIZATION> LPL </ORGANIZATION>'s holding company saying the document had been `` received from sources inside'' the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said notations on the copy indicated it was duplicated from the file copy in the office of <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, who was in charge of investigating the alleged leak. <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> was critical of the `` very limited'' investigation made by <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, but <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said it was unable to determine how the copy reached the regulated utility. `` A properly conducted investigation might have provided <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> with the identity'' of the leaker, according to <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>. The case, <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said, `` demonstrated that a regulated utility secured unauthorized access to <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> documents. The ability to obtain such materials could impact on the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>'s enforcement program, licensing functions and regulatory procedures.'' `` The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> should assure that its investigators conduct their work in a competent manner using professional standards,'' said <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, adding that there is a lack of coordination between the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>'s office of investigations and office of inspector and auditor <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lando </PERSON> <PERSON> Zech </PERSON> said in a statement accompanying the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> study that he agrees the agency needs a first-rate investigative capability. `` The commission will give careful consideration to -LRB- the -RRB- entire report in our continuing efforts to assure that we carry out our investigative responsibilities fairly and efficiently,'' <PERSON> Zech </PERSON> said.

 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> and independent oil exporters on Monday made last-minute preparations for a series of meetings aimed at tightening oil supplies and driving prices up further. Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> Exporting Countries and rival oil producers expressed cautious optimism that an agreement could be reached this week on joint measures to support prices. `` Any meeting between <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> and non-OPEC -LRB- nations -RRB- is important, but this one is particularly so because prices seem to be weak,'' said <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> delegate <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON>, a former oil minister. He said all 13 countries participating in the meetings Tuesday were `` eager to do something'' to prop up prices. World oil markets appeared to be taking a cautiously optimistic stance on the upcoming conferences. In the European spot, or non-contract, market, the price of Brent crude from the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> was up about 10 cents a barrel, at $ 17.25, in late trading, compared with last Friday's close. Traders said activity was light. Futures prices also edged upward on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where contracts for June delivery of <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, closed at $ 18.40 per barrel, up 10 cents from Friday. Senior officials from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> were to meet Tuesday and Wednesday with <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s price monitoring committee, comprised of the oil ministers of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>. That is to be followed on Thursday by a meeting of all 13 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members. Also in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, though not expected to participate in the joint meetings, was <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Hance </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which regulates the state's oil production of 2 million 42-gallon barrels a day. He has indicated he plans to meet individually with ministers to discuss his concern about instability in the oil market. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s oil minister, <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiriart </PERSON> <PERSON> Balderrama </PERSON>, told reporters that <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> was ready to accept a 5 percent cut in its oil exports if other producers agreed to do the same. He declined to be specific about how many, or which, others must go along. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> exports about 1.4 million barrels a day of its total daily output of 2.9 million. `` We know that it might be difficult to reach unanimity'' at this week's meetings, <PERSON> Hiriart </PERSON> <PERSON> Balderrama </PERSON> said through an interpreter. `` But we expect a substantial number of countries to do something similar'' to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s proposed cut. Together, the eight non-OPEC countries represented in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> produce about 8 million barrels a day, compared with <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s estimated output of between 17.5 million and 18 million barrels daily Industry analysts expressed doubt that this week's meeting could reach a concrete agreement on <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> and non-OPEC production cuts. But some said it could mark a turning point in <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s long and largely unsuccessful campaign to win closer cooperation with rival producers. The world's two biggest oil producers _ the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ were not invited to the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> meeting.

 <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON>, who raped a young woman and cut off her forearms with an ax a decade ago, was freed from parole Monday and headed for an undisclosed location, his case continuing to arouse public outrage. `` He was a free man according to law at 12:01 -LRB- a.m. -RRB- today, and he just simply walked off parole from the place he was located,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have no legal right to follow him any further and no statutory means of requiring him to go somewhere,'' he said. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Plath </PERSON>, a member of an inmate support group, said he knew where <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> planned to go but could not reveal the location for fear someone might hurt <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON>. <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON>, 60, was convicted of abducting a teen-age hitchhiker, raping her and then hacking off her forearms near <LOCATION> Modesto </LOCATION>, 45 miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, in 1978. He served eight years of a 14-year sentence. He was under no obligation to tell officials where he planned to go when his year of parole expired, and gave only noncommital answers when asked, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said. `` I think he is very dangerous and unstable. I think he's operating under a delusion -LRB- of innocence -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Stahl </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Stanislaus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> district attorney `` I do n't know what will happen when the pressure gets to be too much or if he falls off the wagon.'' <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON>, who was drinking heavily the day of the attack, has not had alcohol during his imprisonment or parole, officials said. <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON>'s victim, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON>, is living at an undisclosed location and still fears <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON>. Her lawyer said she wants to remain undisturbed and in seclusion. <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> has friends and supporters who do not accept his claims of innocence but believe he will not be dangerous if he is lef alone and can stay with people who care about him. `` While we ca n't forget, ca n't we forgive?'' said <PERSON> Plath </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Marin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> lawyer. Angry protests followed <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> from town to town last year when officials tried to place him in several <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area communities on parole. <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> was finally put in a small trailer on the grounds of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quentin </LOCATION> prison to complete his parole, but a few days ago he was moved to an undisclosed location. The protests now have shifted north to <LOCATION> Azalea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> reportedly will join <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bride </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> after visiting family in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Frightened residents have denounced the plan, and earlier this month someone fired a shotgun at church buildings and vehicles.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A top <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said Monday he will meet with representatives of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> about a possible voluntary agreement to ban fishing in an area of the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> that scientists fear is being overfished. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>, ambassador of oceans and fisheries, said he will brief the four nations in the next few days on U.S.-Soviet fishing talks last week that included discussion of a moratorium on fishing in the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>'s so-called `` doughnut hole.'' While no agreement was reached between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> over the future of fishing in the `` doughnut hole,'' another round of meetings is expected in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> later this spring. <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> earlier had said the U.S.-Soviet negotiations were `` exploratory'' and involved a `` good exchange of views.'' Both countries are concerned that overfishing in the `` doughnut hole,'' by foreign trawlers _ including those from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> _ could cause a decline in the catch in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet fishing zones that surround the area. The 4,500-square mile `` doughnut hole'' is considered one of the richest fishing grounds in the world and the catch in the area has grown from about 200,000 metric tons to more than 1 million metric tons over the past four years. Both the Soviets and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> would prefer a voluntary ban on fishing in the `` doughnut hole.'' The moratorium could be temporary or permanent as scientists study the fish stocks in the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, campaigning on the eve of the primary that should put him over the top, promised Monday to keep `` showing the flag'' no matter how firm his grip on the Republican presidential nomination. `` I still want to continue to campaign through the primary season,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spent the day traveling and speaking in the state, where he is expected to top the 1,139 delegates needed for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination in Tuesday's primary. Most of his remarks were routine, but he answered back after being met at the Scranton-Wilkes Barre airport by a dozen or so hecklers, some of them bearing signs urging the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to end its aid to the Contras in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. `` I'm glad to see the -LRB- <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporters here, or maybe the <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supporters,'' he said. `` I will welcome them in debate, I will welcome taking on their ticket and we will beat them in the fall.'' He has been virtually unopposed for the Republican nomination since the withdrawal last month of Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. His only remaining opponent, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, has ceased active campaigning. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has said he expects to face Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the fall election, struck at Democrats who he said `` talk about despair and agony.'' `` You're going to see a clear choice'' in the general election, he said. He called <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> `` tough and resilient'' and compared its revival to his own. `` You took it on the chin'' economically in the 1970s and early 1980s, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I know what it's like to be knocked to the canvas,'' he said, noting his defeat in the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he picked himself up and started anew, calling that `` a parallel to what you demonstrated here.'' Despite his apparently insurmountable lead, he said, `` I'm still showing the flag in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>.'' At campaign stops through the day, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: _ Said he intends to take part in general-election debates with the Democratic nominee, but he would not be pinned down on dates or format `` There will be debates. I'm looking forward to them, he said. But he also said, in an interview with local reporters, `` I'm not going to let some outside group, even within my own party, set the agenda.'' _ Said he is in full accord with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s promise to veto trade legislation nearing final congressional approval but also said he hoped some other way could be found to notify workers of impending plant closings The bill contains a provision requiring 60 days notice when plants are to be shut down. `` I know it's an emotional issue but it interferes with our ability to compete.'' _ Told a Republican veterans' rally he would try to maintain the defense buildup begun by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` I'll never be afraid to reach out for peace, but I'll do it with my eyes open,'' he said.

<HEAD>New Emigration Documents Worry Soviet Jews</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Jews seeking to emigrate are receiving revised invitations from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> that promise to provide them with visas in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, activists said Monday. The activists said the change is apparently part of an effort to boost emigration to the Jewish state. But it could make it difficult for Jews to settle anywhere else, they said. Invitations from family members and the Israeli government are the official basis on which Jews are allowed to leave. Visas now come through the <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, which has handled <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s interests since the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> broke relations after the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Mkrtchyan </PERSON> said Monday he knew of about a half a dozen people who did not emigrate because the Soviet visa office said they could go only to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> with the new invitations. `` They rejected it because they wanted to go to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' he said in a telephone interview. According to the new invitations, Israeli visas will be issued in <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, the only Soviet bloc nation that has formal relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Stolar </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizen who remains in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> because his <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> wife is refused permission to leave, said Jews who want to go somewhere other than <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> are worried. `` A lot of people are talking about the problem _ whether it will increase or decrease emigration, whether the Soviets will let more people out or whether fewer people will apply,'' he said. Both he and <PERSON> Mkrtchyan </PERSON> want to go to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and are active in a group called `` Poor Relatives,'' for people who are denied permission to leave because a family member will not waive financial obligations imposed by law. They said the new invitations began arriving about three weeks ago and the long-term effect is unclear. In the past, many Soviet Jews left the country through <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, and traveled from there to <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mkrtchyan </PERSON> said it could be difficult for Jews to go anywhere except <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> because of limited connections and because a Jew arriving in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> automatically becomes an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> citizen, limiting his ability to settle elsewhere. Jews who emigrate from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> lose their Soviet citizenship. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> wants Soviet Jews to settle there and has promoted a direct air link via <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. Among those emigrating through <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> was <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Begun </PERSON>, a prominent Soviet Jew who emigrated in January. According to the Union of Councils for Soviet Jews, only 221 of the 986 who emigrated in March went to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and 42 traveled through <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>. The 986 represented the highest total in 15 months. More than 8,000 Jews were allowed to emigrate in all of 1987, many more than in any of the previous several years but still far below the peak of 51,000 in 1979. More than 2,400 Jews emigrated in the first three months of 1988. Sources said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> instructed the <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> to continue issuing visas with which Jews can emigrate through <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> or any other transit city, but activists said that may not matter if Soviet authorities insist on emigrants going by way of <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. Requiring Jews to leave through <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> may increase the number going to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> by 5 to 10 percent, but the rest want to settle elsewhere, <PERSON> Mkrtchyan </PERSON> said.

 A large number of Oregonians say <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> can not win the presidential election because he is black, but only a small number say they wo n't vote for him because of his race, according to a newspaper poll.

 Holocaust survivors hugged each other and shouted `` Bravo, bravo!'' when an <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> judge on Monday sentenced retired <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> autoworker <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> to death for Nazi war crimes. Other Israelis, however, said they were uncomfortable with the imposition of the death penalty. In the <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> area, where the Ukrainian-born <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> lived for more than 30 years before his 1986 extradition to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the sentence increased the grief and anger of the local Ukrainian community. Ukrainian-Americans there prayed and raised money for the man they believe to be innocent. When Judge <PERSON> Zvi </PERSON> <PERSON> Tal </PERSON>, whose parents were killed in the Holocaust, announced the sentence, dozens of courtroom spectators jumped to their feet shouting `` Bravo, bravo!'' and `` Death, death!'' and singing `` The people of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> live.'' But <PERSON> Ephraim </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuroff </PERSON>, head of the Israeli branch of the <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiesenthal </PERSON> center, told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> that while he understood the emotional outburst, it was `` totally uncalled for and just lends credence to ... -LRB- defense claims -RRB- that someone like <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> ca n't get a fair trial in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The center collects and provides to authorities information on suspected Nazi war criminals. Some survivors wept with emotion as the sentence was announced. `` The only justice will be to give him to the survivors and let them finish him off piece by piece,'' said <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, who survived the <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> death camp in Nazi-occupied <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. `` A thousand death -LRB- penalties -RRB- can not compensate for what happened, but at least we have passed judgment on one of the angels of death,'' said <PERSON> Yosef </PERSON> <PERSON> Czarny </PERSON>, a survivor of <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION> death camp, where 850,000 Jews were killed in 1942-43. The court last week convicted <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>, 68, of being `` Ivan the Terrible,'' a sadistic guard at <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION> who operated gas chambers and tortured inmates before sending them to their deaths. About 6 million Jews were killed in the Holocaust. A stated goal of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, which was founded after the Nazi slayings, is to bring <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s henchmen to justice. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industrialist <PERSON> Armand </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON>, who aided <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in obtaining evidence that helped lead to <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s conviction, told a news conference in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Monday before the sentence was announced `` there's no question in my mind ... -LRB- that <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> -RRB- is guilty.'' Hammer, chairman of Los Angeles-based <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION>, was in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to sign a new joint venture agreement. He helped <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> obtain a Nazi identification card that purportedly was issued to <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> as a camp guard. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s son-in-law, <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Nishnic </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, told a news conference in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> was sentenced to death because Jews are haunted by memories of the Holocaust and desperate to punish those guilty of war crimes. `` But we believe there is doubt ... -LRB- <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> -RRB- is <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> the Terrible,'' said <PERSON> Nishnic </PERSON>. `` He's been falsely convicted. The real <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> the Terrible does not have our sympathy or our support, he should be sentenced to death.'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>, `` If he -LRB- <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> -RRB- was a Nazi ... who killed thousands of people, I have no problems with the severity of the punishment.'' But <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dasberg </PERSON>, a psychiatrist and Holocaust survivor, said many Israelis feel uncomfortable with the death penalty even if they believe it is the correct punishment for Nazi war criminals. <PERSON> Dasberg </PERSON> said he himself opposed the death penalty `` for several reasons, among them humanitarian ones.'' `` But this goes beyond that. There are criminals and there are criminals,'' he said. The Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruchok </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ukrainian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lorain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, said Monday, `` It's a travesty of justice.'' <PERSON> Bruchok </PERSON> met <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> and his family shortly before <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> was sent to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to stand trial. The priest said, `` I saw his face. I saw the face of a gentle man who was scared. An innocent man is being executed.'' The Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakonachny </PERSON>, a priest at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vladimir </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ukrainian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Parma </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> family parish, said, `` It has been the unanimous opinion of this parish that <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> is innocent. That has been the opinion since the beginning.'' <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>, a retired <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> autoworker, lived in the <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Seven </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>. After he was convicted, Jewish organizations in <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION>, about 40 miles south of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, asked for police protection because callers were threatening local Jews. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Dackiewicz </PERSON>, who operates the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Demjanjuk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, said that after the sentencing Monday, she had received many telephone calls. `` The phone calls are from people who have been totally outraged at what happened over there,'' she said. <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> president, said he is not a believer in capital punishment, `` but for Holocaust criminals such as <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>, I would be hard pressed not to impose the death sentence.''

<HEAD>Iran Calls for More Volunteers, Iraq Says New Missile Tested</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> called Monday for the nation's youth to prepare to go quickly to the battlefront. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> announced it has successfully tested a new missile capable of reaching deep into Iranian territory. President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, speaking on <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>, said young Iranians `` should get ready to to be sent to the fronts and to fight against the enemies of the Islamic revolution in a most extensive way.'' `` The young people, especially those who have received training and who are ready, should move forward their allotted time for dispatch and go earlier. Others too should continue their dispatch ... in an accelerated form,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> spoke after a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> War </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Effort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. The broadcast was monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> suffered a battlefield setback 10 days ago when <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> forces recaptured the <LOCATION> Faw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. It had been seized by Iranian troops in February 1986. The two countries have been at war since September 1980. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s official news agency, also monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, said a powerful new surface-to-surface missile has been tested successfully. The announcement could serve as a warning to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> not to respond to the loss of Faw by resuming the deadly missile duel known as the `` war of the cities.'' The last such battle lasted from Feb. 29 to last Thursday, with the capitals of <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> being frequent targets. Brig. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON>, director of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s military industries, informed President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> that the new missile named al-Abass has a range of 550 miles, according to the news agency. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has used al-Hussein missiles since last August in the duel with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. It claimed the al-Hussein missiles were domestically produced, but Western military analysts believe they are Soviet-designed SS-1 Scud-B weapons with special rocket boosters to give them a range of up to 400 miles. The agency report gave no details of the new missile. Western analysts said they thought <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> may have obtained a larger missile that also could be equipped with boosters. There was a lull in action along the 730-mile front. Both sides reported scattered skirmishes and artillery duels.

 Strong thunderstorms shook parts of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> on Monday, generating tornadoes that caused damage in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION>, and snow fell in the northern <LOCATION> Rockies </LOCATION> and the northern Plains. Thunderstorms, some severe, rolled across southern sections of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> during the morning. Two tornadoes touched down in rural <LOCATION> Lowndes </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, heavily damaging several homes and taking down trees and power lines. No one was hurt. `` We've had extensive damage. There's been quite a few houses which are wiped out completely,'' <LOCATION> Lowndes </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's deputy <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudd </PERSON> said. `` We've got lines down all over the area.'' Later in the day, in western <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, a powerful storm system spawned at least one tornado in <LOCATION> Carroll </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> but it did not touch down. In <LOCATION> Naylor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Volunteer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was heavily damaged, and fire trucks held up what was left of the battered building. By early afternoon, severe thunderstorms developed rapidly across northern sections of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> as well as west-central <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, and raced eastward at speeds up to 65 mph. A severe thunderstorm over northwestern <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> dropped hail as big as golf balls near <LOCATION> Goodsprings </LOCATION>, about 25 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>. Severe thunderstorms also produced 1 \ - inch hail at <LOCATION> Anniston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>. One-inch hail pelted <LOCATION> Carrollton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Coldwater </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Cleburne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, Marble-size hail fell at <LOCATION> Pinson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, and covered the ground at <LOCATION> Jones </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chapel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION> `` The hail beat my car all to pieces,'' said <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaney </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lowndes </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>. During the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT, 1.02 inches of rain fell at <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga </LOCATION> In <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, a waterspout sighted near <LOCATION> Key </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> moved ashore as a tornado and caused some property damage on <LOCATION> Stock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. Elsewhere, light rain and spotty showers extended from southeastern <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> into western <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>. Heavy snow warnings were posted for south-central <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and mountains and foothills of central <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and snow advisories were posted for the mountains of northwestern <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and the Big Horn Mountains of northeastern <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. By late morning, 5 inches of snow had fallen at both <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lodge </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Arrowhead </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lodge </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Big </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Horn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>. Up to 8 inches of snow was expected in the Big Horns. A snow advisory was also posted for <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>'s northern mountains above 5,500 feet. A winter storm watch was posted overnight for southwestern <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> as the heart of the storm system was expected to move from <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>.

 An Iran-Contra prosecutor withdrew from the case partly because he felt he had been impermissibly exposed to the defendants' congressional testimony, independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> testified Monday. During a lengthy grilling by a lawyer for Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> revealed that associate independent counsel <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> had withdrawn from participation in the case. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> withdrew partly because he believed he might be tainted by congressional testimony given by three of the four defendants under grants of limited immunity from prosecution. `` I do n't know whether he was tainted or not,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> told defense attorney <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> `` All I know about Mr. <PERSON> Todd </PERSON>, he chose to follow a certain course.'' <PERSON> Todd </PERSON>, who remains on the independent counsel's staff doing unrelated work, did n't explain the possible exposure because `` he did n't want to taint me,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> did not say when <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> withdrew, but he was seen last month in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> when former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> Adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of withholding information from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about covert <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration aid to the Contras. The defense contends that forcing <PERSON> North </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> Adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and businessman <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> to go to trial on conspiracy charges would violate their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination because they were forced to testify to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last summer. Arguing there was `` enormous taint'' of <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s staff as a result of unprecedented publicity of the three defendants' immunized testimony, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said: `` This case ca n't proceed if I have any understanding of the Fifth Amendment. No date has been set for the trial of the three men, who along with retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, are accused of conspiring to illegally divert U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan rebels. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> testified on Capitol Hill without an immunity grant. At the outset of Monday's hearing, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> barred any defense testimony on the ground that lawyers for the defendants had disobeyed his order that they give <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> timely notice of the witness they intended to produce. `` The orders of the court are going to be complied with,'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> told the defendants. `` We are going to proceed whether the atmosphere is one of confrontation and name-calling or not,'' the judge told the defendants and their lawyers, who had accused the judge in court papers of establishing a procedure that `` makes a mockery'' of their clients' rights. Late in the day, the defense filed a notice that it intended to appeal <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>'s April 13 order to the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> here. `` I have a great sense of unfairness for my client when you rebuke defense counsel,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, who denied he had violated the order, told the judge after the midday recess. `` I do n't believe you abided either with the letter or the spirit of the court order,'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> replied. During more than four hours of testimony, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> described elaborate procedures he used to prevent investigators, prosecutors and grand jurors from exposure to the testimony that <PERSON> North </PERSON>, <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> and other immunized witnesses gave <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Despite those procedures, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said he was exposed to information about immunized testimony on six occasions _ three before the four defendants were indicted on March 16. `` I was never exposed to the testimony itself _ so far as I know,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said. The information he received was in the form of summaries. Members of the staff were instructed to file reports of similar episodes with <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglass </PERSON>, a part-time independent counsel who was designated to determine if such incidents of exposure would require a prosecutor to leave the staff. But <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> conceded under <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s cross-examination that he never looked at any of the reports <PERSON> Douglass </PERSON> received to determine how well his procedures were working. `` If <PERSON> Douglass </PERSON> had too many breaches I would know about that,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said. Although his orders sometimes called for subjective judgments, a prosecutor would `` know he was jeopardizing the investigation if he's careless,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> turned over <PERSON> Douglass </PERSON>' file to the court so that defense lawyers could examine the reports and question the independent counsel about them when the hearing resumes on Wednesday. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, a former federal judge and veteran prosecutor representing <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> on the immunity issue, said he can show that `` every bit of the evidence was independently derived.'' `` The extensive procedures of insulation are just extras and are really not needed,'' <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said that exposure of a grand jury witness to immunized testimony would n't necessarily scuttle the case, it might only mean that the particular witness could n't testify in the trial. `` Going ahead with the case and immunity are not necessarily irreconcilable,'' he said.

<HEAD>Officials Sacrifice Marsh To Defend Other Wetland Areas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MARTINEZ, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Officials planned Monday to sacrifice a section of wildlife-rich marshland to an oil spill, saying the tactic would save hundreds more acres of wetlands. `` We're trying to keep new areas from becoming oiled,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> of the state Department of Fish and Game. `` We're willing to try and capture as much oil as we can in 20 acres of marsh. About 21,000 gallons of thick, unrefined crude gushed Saturday from a storage tank at <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> refinery, 30 miles northeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. By Monday morning, a slick stretched for 10 miles in <LOCATION> Suisun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Carquinez </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> but was beginning to dissipate in tidal currents. The biggest concentration was confined to an area of marshland and coated at least 100 birds. <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spotter planes, six vessels with oil skimmers and 16 vacuum tank-trucks raced to capture oil and save wetland animals. Floating oil booms were laid in the water to keep oil away from wildlife areas. <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Massey </PERSON> estimated it could take until next week to clean up the spill. <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> acknowledged responsibility for the spill, and <PERSON> Massey </PERSON> said the company would have to pay for the costs of the clean-up and damages, which would include new paint for the bottoms of thousands of pleasure boats in area marinas. There was no immediate estimate of the damage. <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharkey </PERSON> said the spill was the company's worst in 73 years The last at the 850-acre refinery occurred in June 1986 when a tank overflowed 8,000 gallons of oil. By Monday about 100 birds _ including egrets, avocets, cinnamon teals, mallard ducks, grebes, herons and the endangered clapper rail bird _ had been rescued and taken to centers in <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Walnut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> for cleaning, <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> said. The spill also threatened many nests. Volunteers also reported a dozen dead muskrats, several oil-coated turtles and a dead heron.

 A youth apparently upset with the way his gang was depicted in the movie `` Colors'' fatally shot a possible rival gang member who was waiting in line to see the film, police said Monday. Authorities were searching for <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Vain </PERSON> <PERSON> Queen </PERSON>, 21, of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and two companions as suspects in Sunday's slaying of <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawson </PERSON>, 19, of <PERSON> Stockton </PERSON>, said Deputy Police Chief <PERSON> Lucian </PERSON> <PERSON> Neely </PERSON>. Witnesses, who said they knew Queen when he lived in <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION>, told officers he was wearing a red handkerchief, which indicates membership in the Bloods gang, while the victim had on a blue handkerchief, signifying the Crips gang. Both gangs are based in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> but have `` a presence'' in <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION> 300 miles north, said Lt. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Swim </PERSON>. Some authorities had expressed worry that violence would result from the film starring <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvall </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON>, but before this shooting death, only minor incidents had been reported at theaters around the country since it opened April 15. <PERSON> Swim </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dawson </PERSON>, his girlfriend, sister and brother-in-law were waiting in line at the Regency Theater to buy tickets for the next showing of the controversial film about <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> gangs and police. He said the shooting erupted after one of the suspects walked up to <PERSON> Dawson </PERSON> and asked: `` Are you a ricket?,'' which the lieutenant said is considered a derogatory term against the <LOCATION> Crips </LOCATION> gang. <PERSON> Dawson </PERSON> was shot in the head as he tried to flee. The bullet also hit a 17-year-old girl in the line, but she was not seriously hurt. `` The suspects were n't happy with the way things were going on the screen because apparently the gang they are affiliated with was n't winning,'' <PERSON> Neely </PERSON> said. `` They were creating a bit of a disturbance, and when they left, they saw the blue -LRB- bandanna -RRB- and made the derogatory comments.'' A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Mann </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theaters </ORGANIZATION>, which operates the Regency, said it was pulling the movie from that theater but was not considering withdrawing it from any of its other 450 screens in seven Western states. Police Chief P.F. <PERSON> Calkins </PERSON> said he would ask the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joaquin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Attorney </LOCATION>'s Office to seek an injunction barring further showings of `` Colors'' here. Police and sheriff's deputies have patroled theaters in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and other places with known gangs during the screening of the movie. The Guardian Angels, the self-styled citizen crime-fighters, had been among those claiming the film glorified gangs and would prompt violence by viewers. But <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>, the film's distributor defended the movie's release. `` If there is anything this picture does not do, it does not glorify gangs or gang violence.'' <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> said.

 Four of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s main non-nuclear missiles still are having quality problems that have delayed delivery or produced some substandard weapons, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. `` All of the missile systems we examined had defects _ that is, they failed in one respect or another to conform with contract specifications,'' said the congressional watchdog agency. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> reviewed the <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, High-Speed Anti-Radiation -LRB- HARM -RRB-, <LOCATION> Harpoon </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Sparrow </LOCATION> missiles, four weapons deployed on a variety of <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships for use against other ships and planes. The review, done for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> investigations subcommittee, found:

<TEXT>
 _ Design and workmanship problems on safety and arming devices aboard the <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> AIM-54C, problems which the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said have delayed deliveries of more than 500 <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> missiles The weapon is built by <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION> _ Pressure transducers for some HARMs may not have been tested before being put into the missiles The transducer is used in activating the weapon's target-seeking device. The chief contractor is <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION>. _ Altimeters for the Harpoon were being accepted under a contract deviation permitting a soldering-related condition which the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said could affect the weapon's reliability The main contractor is <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell-Douglas </ORGANIZATION>. _ Detonators on some Sparrows were unknowingly built without enough explosive compound to set off the warhead The chief contractor is <ORGANIZATION> Raytheon </ORGANIZATION>. Most of the problems occurred at the level of subcontractors, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. `` One common problem was that changes were made in manufacturing processes which were unknown to the prime contractor, but affected the quality of the product,'' the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Many of the problems related to soldering, but it is unclear how serious the problems are, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Some contractors and government officials believe that certain requirements in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s soldering specification are more stringent than necessary to have a reliable missile,'' the report said. `` They cite high reliability rates and the successful use of missiles that deviate from the soldering specifications as evidence that the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s soldering specifications may be too stringent,'' it said. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, in a response that was part of the review, said it partially agrees with the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Katzen </PERSON>, deputy assistant secretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> for systems, said the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> `` acknowledges that a number of problems have been experienced during the production of <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> missiles.'' But, <PERSON> Katzen </PERSON> added, `` contrary to the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> implication, in no case has the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> knowingly accepted missiles suspected of containing defects that could affect the performance of the missile. In any case where the defects were determined to affect performance, the contractor was required to take the necessary corrective actions.'' In addition, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> noted, pilots, ordnance officers, and other <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials aboard ships `` were satisfied with the missiles' performance and capabilities and cited no particular problems.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet publishers agreed Monday to breathe some glasnost into the high-tech field by jointly publishing the first Russian-language magazine devoted to personal computers. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said the venture with <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> i </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sviaz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishers </ORGANIZATION> was the first joint publishing effort in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` The Soviet government is definitely interested in getting the use of PCs widespread,'' <ORGANIZATION> IDG </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Leblois </PERSON> said. `` When you think that a few years ago getting permission to use a typewriter or a copying machine was very difficult, the change is very great.'' <ORGANIZATION> IDG </ORGANIZATION> publishes PC World, the second largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> publication on personal computers with a monthly circulation of about 475,000. The first issue of PC World <ORGANIZATION> USSR </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to hit Soviet newsstands at the end of June. A staff of seven Soviet writers and editors will produce about one-third of the magazine's copy, with the rest translated from <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sources. The magazine will cost 2 rubles, or about $ 3.20 at the official exchange rate, <PERSON> Leblois </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Salnicov </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> i </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sviaz </ORGANIZATION>, said some foreign language computer journals are available in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> libraries but that Soviet PC users have no information about developments within the country. Personal computers are in their infancy in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, with under 100,000 Western-made machines used only by a few universities, government officers, scientists and engineers, <PERSON> Salnicov </PERSON> said. But the country has a potential market of 30 million users, he added. `` We feel that from what our experts think the PC enables you to increase your labor productivity by several hundred percent, so there's every reason to have them,'' <PERSON> Salnicov </PERSON> said. About 50,000 copies of the magazine's first issue will be available in bookstores and on newsstands, `` which we know will not come near to satisfying the demand,'' <PERSON> Salnicov </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Leblois </PERSON> said issues will average 150 pages or more, of which about 20 percent will be advertising. Four issues a year are initially planned. In keeping with Soviet guidelines on joint ventures adopted in January 1987, the Soviet partner will own 51 percent of the project and <ORGANIZATION> IDG </ORGANIZATION> will own 49 percent. <PERSON> Leblois </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> IDG </ORGANIZATION> has invested $ 250,000 into the project but expects to recoup that almost immediately through advertising from Western computer makers seeking a foothold in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The magazine already has sold ads for its first issue to companies including <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Atari </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ashton-Tate </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Bull </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Siemens </ORGANIZATION>, he said. The first issue should carry $ 120,000 of ads, <PERSON> Leblois </PERSON> said. The Soviets did not detail their investment, but in addition to the seven writers, the magazine will be printed in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` As long as they can hold their investment down there's not much to lose,'' <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, associate director of the <ORGANIZATION> Russian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said of <ORGANIZATION> IDG </ORGANIZATION>'s participation. `` The question is how long advertisers will be interested, if they're selling to a Soviet audience which ca n't buy what they're selling. But <PERSON> Leblois </PERSON> noted that 16-bit personal computers, which include the <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> PC and other compatible machines, can be exported to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> under relaxed guidelines agreed by Western countries in January. He predicted that American, Western European and Japanese computer makers will rush to secure joint-production agreements. PC World <ORGANIZATION> USSR </ORGANIZATION>'s sales will cover all production costs and advertising revenues will be paid in Western currencies. That will make it easier for <ORGANIZATION> IDG </ORGANIZATION> to repatriate earnings from the project, something which has been a problem for other joint ventures generating earnings in rubles. IDG hich publishes local language editions of PC World in 14 nations. It has published <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computerworld </ORGANIZATION>, a monthly, since 1980 and began a computer magazine in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> two years ago, its only other publication in the east bloc.

 The government will hire foreign experts to train a special, 100-member anti-terrorism force to combat hijackers like those who commandeered a <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jetliner this month, security officials said Monday. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s crown prince and prime minister, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Saad </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Sabah </PERSON>, meanwhile called on `` sister and friendly states'' to arrest, try and punish the hijackers and asked for inter-Arab cooperation to fight terrorism. He said he did not know if the hijackers were still in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, where the ordeal ended on its 16th day last Wednesday. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s move came amid growing fears in <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states that the 7 -LCB- - year-war between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> will increase terrorism by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem groups <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> intends to form its own anti-terrorist squad, it was reported last month. The Saudis are to receive help from Gen. <PERSON> Ulrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Wegener </PERSON>, commander of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s crack anti-terrorist force. He headed the commandos that stormed a hijacked <ORGANIZATION> Lufthansa </ORGANIZATION> jetliner in <LOCATION> Mogadishu </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION>, in 1977, considered a classic anti-hijacking operation. Many West European countries, including <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, have elite units which have acted against terrorists over the last 20 years. The new Kuwaiti force will be directed by the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> after a six-month training program by foreign experts in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and abroad, said the security officials, speaking on condition of anonymity. They gave no details and did not identify the foreign specialists. Pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems hijacked the Kuwaiti <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 with 112 people aboard April 5 as it was flying from <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. The hijackers killed two Kuwaiti passengers before the ordeal ended in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> on Wednesday. The hijackers demanded that <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> release 17 terrorists convicted for bombing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and French embassies in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> in 1983. Kuwaiti officials said they would not release them. The hijacking ended when the gunmen slipped off the jet, apparently after receiving a promise of safe passage to an undisclosed country. The passengers left the plane shortly afterward. <PERSON> Rashed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel-Aziz </PERSON> <PERSON> Rashed </PERSON>, minister of state for Cabinet affairs, told <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> al-Sharq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> al-Awsat </ORGANIZATION> newspaper that <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> had not been told of the hijackers' whereabouts. However, the right-wing daily newspaper al-Seyassa and the radical al-Rai al-Aam daily reported Monday that <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> security authorities, aided by unidentified foreign intelligence agencies, have identified the hijackers. It did not elaborate. <PERSON> Rashed </PERSON> told al-Seyassa that `` certain powers and parties hostile to the Arabs were behind the hijacking.'' It was an apparent reference to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the pro-Iranian, Lebanon-based <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is Persian, not Arab. Although it shares the Moslem religion with the Arabs, it adheres to the minority <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> sect that has been at odds with the predominant Sunni branch of Islam for 1,300 years. The Shiite fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> is believed to be the umbrella group for <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> factions holding most of the 21 foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The longest held is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 40, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985. The <ORGANIZATION> Kuwaiti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> set up a committee to investigate the hijacking, <PERSON> Rashed </PERSON> announced Sunday, saying `` murdering the two <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> passengers is a crime that will not go unpunished.'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Saad </PERSON> told editors of local and weekly newspapers in a televised news conference Monday that tiny, oil-rich <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> `` alone can not put an end to or contain the activity of terrorists. I hereby issue a frank and sincere call to our Arab brethren to cooperate to fight terrorism and terrorists wherever they exist.'' `` The apprehension, trial and punishment of the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- hijackers should take place through constructive dialogue between us and sister and friendly states,'' <PERSON> Saad </PERSON> said. He also said that when the jet landed at <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION> airport in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> early in its Odyssey, <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> officials pressed the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> team which flew to <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION> `` to accept all or part of the hijackers' demands, but the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> reply was a clear and frank rejection.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Monday condemned the assassination of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s military commander and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> abstained, allowing the resolution to pass 14-0. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has frequently used its veto power as one of the council's five permanent members to block resolutions criticizing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The resolution did not explicitly accuse <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> of killing <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>, the No. 2 man in the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, but <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> sources and <LOCATION> Tunisian </LOCATION> officials have said <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON> was slain by Israeli commandos. <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>, also known as <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jihad </PERSON>, was shot to death April 16 at his home in suburban <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has not made any official response to the claims that it was responsible for the assassination, and it boycotted the council debate. Diplomats said the resolution probably would have been vetoed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> if it had specifically blamed <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The resolution `` condemns vigorously the aggression perpetrated ... against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> in flagrant violation of the Charter of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, international law and norms of conduct.'' The carefully negotiated text mentions <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> by name twice. It cites a 1985 resolution passed after <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> bombed the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> headquarters, which denounced `` acts of aggression,'' and in the preamble notes <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> complained to the council about a new Israeli act of aggression. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Okun </PERSON> said one reason the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could not vote for the resolution was that it contained language suggesting sanctions. The resolution expressed the council's `` determination to take the appropriate steps to ensure the implementation of the present resolution.'' <PERSON> Okun </PERSON> said the measure `` disproportionately places all blame for this latest round in the rising spiral of violence in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> on one event only, while failing to mention other actions that preceded it.'' Israeli Ambassador <PERSON> Johanan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bein </PERSON>, contacted by telephone, declined comment on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> abstention. He accused the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> of putting <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on trial even though it `` has made no admission'' of responsibility. He also said the council had ignored <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>'s terrorist past, and the fact that <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON> masterminded a 1978 bus hijacking in which 35 Israelis were killed. `` The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, including <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jihad </PERSON>, took responsibility and glorified those acts of terrorism which they planned and perpetrated and the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> never dealt with it and never condemned it,'' <PERSON> Bein </PERSON> said. Both <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> expressed satisfaction that the measure passed, but it did not `` fully come up to our expectations,'' said Foreign Minister <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Mestiri </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Okun </PERSON> referred to <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> as a friend of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and said `` the perpetration of political assassination on Tunisian soil stands in stark contrast to <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>'s longstanding tradition of non-violence.'' During three days of debate, scores of speakers accused <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> of practicing state terrorism. The permanent members of the 15-member council are the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Although <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolutions are considered binding, they are often ignored.

<TEXT>
 An Episcopal church used a court order to turn a family away from services because of a 9-year-old boy's disruptive behavior, but the family found at least temporary refuge at another house of worship <PERSON> Sheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Geartz </PERSON>, her son, <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>, and 7-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON>, were turned away from a service Sunday at <ORGANIZATION> Grace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION>'s largest Episcopal congregation. Officials at Grace had obtained a temporary restraining order from a district judge last week barring <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>, who they claim has disrupted services since the family began attending the church seven months ago. After being denied entry, the family was taken by a reporter to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> David </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, where they attended a service without incident. As they left, they were greeted by <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Craig </PERSON>, a deacon at the church. `` Literally, anyone is welcome at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> David </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> said Monday in an interview. `` My feeling at this point is: I greeted her, I met her children and she certainly is welcome to return. There was no disruption.'' Officals at Grace Cathedral said the boy had talked loudly, pulled a fire alarm, thrown objects at worshippers and destroyed church property during past services. The church's court action did not specify what the boy had thrown or destroyed. `` The level of disturbance moved from being merely annoying to being utterly intolerable,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shahan </PERSON>, dean of Grace Cathedral. `` We were faced with a situation in which one person had determined her needs were paramount to the needs of the entire congregation.'' Ms. <PERSON> Geartz </PERSON>, who is divorced and does not work, told reporters Sunday her son has been disruptive, but she maintained he has emotional problems that have improved through church attendance. She said she went to Grace Cathedral on Sunday because she wanted to take a stand for emotionally disturbed people. She said she would pray this week before deciding whether to attempt to return there. There was no answer to repeated calls to the Geartz residence Monday. A church secretary at <ORGANIZATION> Grace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION> said she fielded 21 calls Monday about Ms. <PERSON> Geartz </PERSON>, of which 13 endorsed the church's action and eight were opposed.

 An army truck hit a mine southeast of the capital and 17 soldiers were killed, military sources said Monday. They reported five soldiers were injured. The soldiers perished either in the explosion near <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ostuma </LOCATION>, 40 miles southeast of the capital, or when the truck crashed and burned, said the sources speaking on condition of anonymity. Col. <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Carranza </PERSON> gave a conflicting report to a radio station of the deaths in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION> province. He said the driver lost control of the vehicle and it crashed, causing grenades carried by the soldiers to explode. Officials in <LOCATION> Soyopango </LOCATION>, four miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, reported the finding of the bullet-riddled bodies of two people who were taken from their homes Sunday night by men wearing army uniforms. <PERSON> Amparo </PERSON> <PERSON> Montes </PERSON>, justice of the peace, said she identified the bodies of <PERSON> Nicolasa </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> <PERSON> Palacios </PERSON>, 77, and her son <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>, 45, who were killed by 38-caliber bullets. She said Mrs. <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>'s body showed signs of rape. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>'s wife <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Leticia </PERSON> told reporters the victims were taken from their home Sunday night by men in uniforms who said they wanted the two to identify a captured guerrilla suspect. She said she heard shots 90 minutes later. In a similar case 10 days ago in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION> province, the bodies of three slain men showed signs of torture. <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON>, auxiliary archbishop of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, said in his homily Sunday that the armed forces were responsible for the three killings in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s new foreign minister said Monday his top priorities are normalizing relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and persuading it to lift economic sanctions against his country. <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> also said Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s departure would not solve <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s problems unless it was part of a `` national dialogue'' with the opposition <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, commander of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s 15,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, has rejected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demands that he resign and leave the country. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> responded by imposing economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who controls <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s civilian government, was indicted in February by a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> that accused him of being a drug trafficker. `` Let's suppose Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> would leave today,'' <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> said in an interview. `` Would banks open immediately?

He was named foreign minister Sunday in a Cabinet shuffle, replacing <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Abadia </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> is to return to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> Tuesday. `` It is not in the interest of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to keep this awkward relationship for long,'' he said in the interview. `` We have to get together and talk about it, but it's a very complicated thing. I myself do n't know exactly what's going to happen.'' He urged the Panamanian opposition to agree to a `` national dialogue'' that he said could include negotiations for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s resignation `` I think people are missing the point when they think Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s departure is the final solution to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s crisis,'' he said. `` We have to speak about the next elections. We have to speak about the press that has been silenced. We have to talk about the future of the economy.'' Opposition leaders in March rejected what they called an ill-defined offer of negotiations with the government, saying <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> must leave first. `` If that -LRB- <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s departure -RRB- is conceded from the beginning, there is hardly anything that will bring Panamanians and the government together for a dialogue,'' <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> said. `` There can not be any preconditions for the dialogue.''

 Two teen-agers were killed in clashes between police and separatists in violence following weekend elections in this <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> territory, police reported Tuesday. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s minister for overseas territories, <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Pons </PERSON>, arrived in the archipelego late Sunday and told a news conference that gendarmes had been ordered to `` return gunfire with gunfire.'' The latest deaths bring to six the number of people killed in five days. An 18-year-old Melanesian woman, <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Akaro </PERSON>, was shot to death Monday during a clash between gendarmes and militant separatists in the eastern town of <LOCATION> Canala </LOCATION>, police headquarters in <LOCATION> Noumea </LOCATION> said. The privately owned radio station <ORGANIZATION> TUW </ORGANIZATION> said gendarmes and separatists fired as the police were leaving their post. A 17-year-old boy of mixed race, shot Monday afternoon in a confrontation in the west coast town of <LOCATION> Houaylou </LOCATION>, died early Tuesday, police said. Separatists, most of them Melanesian, continued to hold hostage 16 police officers seized Friday on the island of <LOCATION> Ouvea </LOCATION> when violence related to regional elections broke out and four gendarmes were fatally wounded. Eleven other captive police officers were freed at dawn Monday after tribal chiefs pressured the separatists. In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, Premier <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> said on national television that the 11 were liberated `` through the use of French army forces.'' He indicted that efforts were under way to free the others, but provided no details. <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> called the captors `` terrorists'' and said they would be tried and punished as such. President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> asked that results in Sunday's first round of the presidential elections in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>, held simultaneously with regional elections, be canceled, a move <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> called a `` mean -LRB- political -RRB- maneuver. Should the request be granted by the <ORGANIZATION> Constitutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's highest legal body, it would not effect the overall outcome of the French presidential election. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s campaign headquarters said many polling stations in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION> had been closed because of threats of violence and <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> representatives `` were unable to control the regularity of operations in the other stations.'' The Socialist president won Sunday's balloting, but ranked fourth in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION> with 4.9 percent of the vote. <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, a conservative who placed second and will compete with <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> in second-round voting May 8, took 74.6 percent of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION> vote. The separatists, known as Kanaks, boycotted the vote polls to protest the new territorial assembly created by <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>'s government over their objections. Native Melanesians make up 43 percent of the island group's population of 145,000 Europeans comprise 36 percent of the residents. The rest are mainly Asian or Tahitian. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION> is 750 miles east of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> told reporters that he had given orders that `` all those who ... -LRB- attack authorities without provocation -RRB- or take part in violent actions be neutralized.'' <PERSON> Leopold </PERSON> <PERSON> Joredie </PERSON>, a leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Kanak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, called <PERSON> Pons </PERSON>' statement `` a declaration of colonial war.'' Violence began Friday with the storming of a police station on <LOCATION> Ouvea </LOCATION>, 90 miles northeast of the capital of <LOCATION> Noumea </LOCATION>. Twenty-seven gendarmes were taken hostage and three of their colleagues were hacked to death with machetes. A fourth gendarme injured in the attack died in a <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, hospital Sunday. Three Melanesians were wounded. The kidnappers demanded the regional elections be canceled and that police reinforcements be removed from the island. They also demanded that negotiators be sent from <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> to discuss independence for the island. `` We do not negotiate with terrorists and criminals,'' <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> said. `` These terrorists will be treated as terrorists.'' About 20 people were killed in 1984 violence that pitted Kanaks against pro-French settlers.

They are the two main American bases here, and Filipino anti-nuclear activists claim they provide storage or transshipment points for nuclear arms. `` Our best information ... is that there are nuclear weapons in the bases and that is why we need to approve this legislation,'' said <PERSON> Tanada </PERSON>. The bill is expected to pass the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> but to face strong opposition in the lower house. <PERSON> Tanada </PERSON> said the measure would reaffirm a constitutional provision that bans nuclear weapons from <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> territory `` consistent with the national interest.'' A draft of the proposal says `` peaceful uses of nuclear energy'' and commercial nuclear-powered ships would be excluded. Nuclear-capable ships `` in distress'' would be allowed access to Philippine waters for a limited duration and with the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> president's permission. The bill proposes creation of a monitoring commission. Violators would face six years to life in prison, with foreigners to be deported after serving their jail term. Also on Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> said Filipino commanders should have access to all areas of the two large U.S-run military bases, including rooms where sensitive messages are decoded. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> are reviewing the 1947 Military Bases Agreement, under which the Americans maintain six military installations here. The current agreement expires in 1991.

 Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> held a rare news conference Monday to talk of his health and his fabled past as the world's longest-reigning monarch The annual news conference, which will be broadcast Friday on the emperor's 87th birthday, came as some Japanese already were preparing for the death of the emperor. Medical equipment has been moved from a hospital on palace grounds into <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s living quarters so he can die at home, said sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Access to the living area has been limited to close family members, they said. However, they said there was no indication his health is failing. Some newspaper have already chosen the words they will use to announce his death. At Monday's news conference for 30 Japanese reporters, <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> talked of World War II and its aftermath, said the sources. It has been 13 years since his last news conference with foreign reporters, when he denied planning the attack on <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> but left many other questions unanswered. On the throne since Dec. 25, 1926, <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> is especially known for his role as <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s wartime leader who was considered semi-divine. He has ruled longer than any monarch alive. The emperor underwent surgery Sept. 22 after complaining of weakness and nausea. Surgeons performed an intestinal bypass to relieve pressure on the intestines caused by an enlargement of the pancreas. Since then, <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> has resumed some duties, but 54-year-old Crown Prince <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> has taken an increasingly active role. Under the constitution, <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> is a symbol of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, not a political leader. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> has been spending most of his time in the imperial palace, a vast complex in the center of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. He has said he lives like a bird in a cage. Three days a week, he goes into his office behind the grand meeting hall for foreign dignitaries. Twenty times a year, the emperor holds religious ceremonies to mark such occasions as equinoxes, the rice harvest, and his birthday. Although he renounced his divinity at the end of World War II, <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> still holds the position as the nation's highest-ranking <LOCATION> Shinto </LOCATION> priest Japanese feelings toward the emperor differ greatly among generations. There is strong reverence among the elderly, who remember him when he was believed to be a god. Their first duties as schoolchildren during a fire were to remove the emperor's portrait. Younger people born after the start of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s rapid economic growth tend to take less interest.

 A man accused of embezzling $ 1.1 million from an <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> credit union nearly five years ago was arrested Monday by authorities who said they had grown suspicious of his spending cash on a home and fancy cars. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON>, 40, was taken into custody without incident by <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents and police in this city near <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> Friendswood </LOCATION> Police Lt. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> recognized <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON> after seeing his picture in a recent <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> flier issued in connection with the television series `` Unsolved Mysteries,'' the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON> was reported missing by his wife in July 1983, the same time the $ 1.1 million disappeared from the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Waterloo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON> had worked. He left a note saying he could no longer cope with the pressures of job and family. `` He's been here since 1984 when he bought a house, but has no visible means of support,'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON> paid cash for the house and drove around town in a Ferrari and an <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Romeo </ORGANIZATION>, which he also bought for cash, <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said. `` We did a reverse investigation,'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said. `` We researched how he came into a lot of money. When he bought his house and fancy cars in cash, people were suspicious.'' `` There was no doubt in my mind it was him when I saw the flier,'' he said. `` I was shocked. I probably have 600 pages of reports on this guy from the last three years and he looks the same.'' `` <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON> admitted his identity following his arrest,'' said <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Hara </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> special agent in charge of the district office at <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>. Authorities believe that after his disappearance <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON> took a July 21 flight to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, but they were not able to track his movements. He left behind a note to his family saying he took the money and fled because he `` could no longer cope with home and work pressures.'' In part of the letter included in federal court documents, <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON> wrote to his wife, `` This is a very difficult letter to write but I could n't let you find out from someone else first. If I call you to read this letter, it means that I have successfully left the state with around $ 1 million from the credit union.'' <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON> had worked at the credit union for 10 years and was described as a reliable and respected employee. His wife, <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON>, has since divorced <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON> and retained custody of their three children, ages 11, 7 and 1 when their father disappeared. <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON>, who is charged in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> with credit union fraud and embezzlement, is being held in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> pending an appearance before a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> magistrate. Hopes of catching <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON> rose in February when producers of the `` Unsolved Mysteries'' program arrived in <LOCATION> Waterloo </LOCATION> to prepare for a segment on the missing cash and credit union employee.

 One of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s last diesel-electric submarines lay on the ocean's surface tied to a rescue vessel Monday after a underwater explosions and a toxic fire injured 22 sailors and left three missing. The 30-year-old USS Bonefish, its remaining crew evacuated to shore bases, floated alongside the submarine rescue ship USS Petrel about 160 miles off <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, said Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, a spokesman at <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>. There was no apparent danger that the submarine, which carries only conventional weapons, would sink, said Chief Petty Officer <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Borton </PERSON>, a fleet spokesman. It was not known if the missing men were aboard the sub or in the water. Long said preliminary indications pointed toward a series of explosions, including one in the battery compartment, but he said he was unable to say precisely where the other explosions occurred on the ship. The fire broke out in the forward battery compartment, he said. The <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, S.C.-based USS Petrel arrived on the scene Monday afternoon, but <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials said any decision to board the submarine was being delayed until Tuesday. `` The decision made was that no one goes aboard'' until the Petrel's experts declare the ship free of dangerous fumes Tuesday morning, <PERSON> Long </PERSON> said. The Petrel, based in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, was alongside the submarine with a line attached to keep the submarine from drifting, <PERSON> Long </PERSON> said. `` They are waiting until daybreak to commence any operation. No one has boarded the vessel at this point,'' <PERSON> Long </PERSON> said. Also steaming to the scene was the salvage ship USS Hoist from the <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> Amphibious Base in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>. The explosion occurred Sunday afternoon in the boat's battery compartment while the Bonefish was submerged on a routine training mission, said <PERSON> Borton </PERSON>. The explosion triggered a fire that filled the 219-foot vessel with smoke and toxic fumes. The sub surfaced and Cmdr. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, the commander, ordered it evacuated. The frigate USS Carr, which also was in the training exercise, took aboard 89 of the Bonefish's 92 crewmen. The McCloy, which also was training nearby, reached the Bonefish before nightfall, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said. Also steaming to the scene and expected to arrive Tuesday was the salvage ship USS Hoist from the <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> Amphibious Base in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>. The Bonefish was launched in 1958 from <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipbuilding </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>. It is powered on the surface by three 1,500-horsepower diesel engines that drive a single propeller and charge batteries. While submerged, the batteries power two electric motors. The Bonefish and its two sister ships, the <PERSON> Barbel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Blueback </PERSON>, are among the last of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s diesel-electric submarines and are used principally to mimic Soviet submarines in training exercises. The Soviets still operate about 100 diesel-electric boats. The Bonefish is the second <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> vessel to bear that name. The first, a World War II submarine, disappeared in the Sea of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in June 1945 while on combat patrol. The 22 injured were transferred to the aircraft carrier <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, which steamed to <LOCATION> Mayport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. From there they were flown to the <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> The other crewmen were taken to <LOCATION> Mayport </LOCATION> by the <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> and flown to the <ORGANIZATION> Charleston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, where they arrived Monday afternoon. <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION> headquarters said two sailors were seriously injured, but the nature and extent of their injuries was not immediately available. The majority of the sailors disembarked from the Carr in <LOCATION> Mayport </LOCATION> wearing blue overalls and sneakers, though many were shoeless. Reporters were not allowed to talk to the crewmen when they returned to <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>. They looked grim as they walked across the tarmac to meet about 30 waiting relatives. One woman wore a jacket reading `` Diesel Boats Forever'' beneath a cartoon of a submarine. One Bonefish sailor aboard a bus awaiting transport back to the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> base was asked if he and his shipmates were alright. `` Yes, thank <PERSON> God </PERSON> for that,'' said the unidentified crewman. He refused to comment about conditions on the boat during the fire. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> identified the missing men as Lt. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Everts </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Naoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, Petty Officer 1st Class <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bordelon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Willis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and Petty Officer 3rd Class <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindgren </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Pisgah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> N.C </LOCATION>

<HEAD>LA Most Dangerous, Dallas-Fort Worth Safest, Newspaper Poll Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Pilots responding to a survey on airport safety rated <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> the most dangerous in the nation and <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> the safest, it was reported Monday. However, many of the pilots said the main factor governing airport safety is people, and that can vary at any facility at any time, according to the survey, conducted by The Atlantic Constitution. The newspaper in February and March polled 2,200 pilots who hold air transportation certificates, asking them to list in no particular order the five safest and least safest airports. The newspaper, reporting the survey results in its Monday editions, said 1,360 pilots responded. The report did not include how many times a particular airport was named and did not list additional airports. In addition to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION>, the airports listed as the five least safe were <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s National, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> and, in a tie, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Lindbergh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Stapleton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> In addition to the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> airport, listed among the five safest facilities were <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Hartsfield-Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Dulles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> @ <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>. Many pilots, in written comments, said it was difficult to rate airports for safety. `` It depends on the people,'' wrote a <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> pilot. `` These constantly change. So an airport that could be labeled unsafe today might not be tomorrow.'' A <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> pilot said, `` It can be compared to the question, ` Where is the safest place to drive a car?' <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> has great long and wide roads -LRB- that are -RRB- well lit. But you better watch out because an animal or human with a gun might ruin your whole day. The key is pilot complacency.'' But quite a few pilots had gripes about specific airports. Some of the harshest criticism was reserved for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s National, where pilots expressed displeasure with that airport's noise abatement procedures and the ban on flying over national monuments. National's noise rules require them to cut power on takeoff while performing relatively tricky maneuvers at uncomfortably low altitudes. `` This is particularly a consideration when aircraft are departing for long flights and may be loaded to or near maximum allowable weight,'' wrote a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> pilot with 22 years' experience. `` Power loss in conjunction with low-altitude maneuvering and even minimal wind shear or turbulence could be disastrous.'' The rule about national monuments makes pilots take awkward routes in and out of the airport, poll returns said. National, the airport of choice for Congressmen and lobbyists, remains open `` only ... for political convenience,'' one pilot said. Los Angeles International also drew the ire of many respondents. Among the problems at that airport, pilots said, was its varied mix of small planes and jumbo jets. `` Any airport that mixes light aircraft and commercial jet aircraft is less safe in direct proportion to the number of light aircraft using the facility,'' one pilot wrote. `` Light aircraft are difficult to see and often do not show up on air traffic control radar.'' <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> O'Hare </PERSON> stood out for making both the five-safest and five-most dangerous lists. It received praise from several pilots for its controllers' ability to deal well with the combined pressures of heavy traffic and winter storms. To get to <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION>, pilots must run the gantlet between <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> airports, both within 15 miles. `` That can make approaches kind of dicey,'' one pilot wrote. <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> also has strict noise-abatement rules similar to those at National. The paper printed no specific comments on either the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> airports.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> on Monday announced its approval of a $ 37.4 billion jet fighter project involving four European nations. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> was the first to declare its support of the European Fighter Aircraft. No final decisions have been made by the governments of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. Defense Secretary <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Younger </PERSON> told Parliament the British decision still depends on agreement by the three other countries. The first of the 800 aircraft are to be in service in 1996. British officials expect the defense ministers of the four countries will approve the project at a meeting in <LOCATION> Hanover </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, on May 11. Under a preliminary accord signed in September, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> each will pay one-third of the cost, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> 21 percent and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> 13 percent. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> are to each order 250 of the warplanes, with the first to come into service in 1996. The estimated cost of each jet will be $ 49 million, and some West German critics say that is too much. Younger said the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fighter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> `` will fulfill a vital defense need in the best and most cost-effective way. It will continue the trend of successful European collaboration in aerospace -LRB- and -RRB- it will ensure that our industry remains in the forefront of this technology to the end of the century and beyond.'' <PERSON> Denzil </PERSON> <PERSON> Davies </PERSON>, the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s defense spokesman, expressed relief that `` on this occasion at least the government has been forced'' to agree to European rather than American technology. In 1986, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> scrapped its own surveillance-plane system that had cost millions of dollars and ordered instead Airborne Warning and Control -LRB- AWACs -RRB- aircraft produced by the Seattle-based <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>.

He said <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> once intervened personally to block his release. The damages can be collected against any of <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>'s assets that <PERSON> Martinez-Baca </PERSON> and his lawyers can find Ms. <PERSON> Hoeper </PERSON> said she was skeptical about <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>'s claim of poverty. `` This is someone who is alleged to have taken many millions of dollars when he was in a position of power in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>,'' she said. `` He paid his attorneys $ 100,000 in wire transfers from <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and we're sure there's more where that came from.'' <PERSON> Martinez-Baca </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> and works in a law office, said he doubted he would ever collect all the money.

 Signs of thawing in U.S.-Soviet relations are giving a measure of hope to some people in the strife-torn <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>' chief correspondent there said Monday. `` They hope that there is a spinoff there for the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Tatro </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>'s chief of bureau in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. `` We see in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> a certain loss of hope, a very negative type of atmosphere,'' he said. <PERSON> Tatro </PERSON> and four other <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> executives and correspondents discussed the situation in their areas in a conversation with <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boccardi </PERSON> during the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>'s annual meeting here Monday.

<HEAD>Black Labor Federation Angered By Threatened Wage Freeze</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 This nation's main black labor federation warned Monday of `` anger and confrontation'' if President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> fulfills a threat to impose wage controls in the private sector. `` The government underestimates just how sensitive an issue wages is,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Meintjies </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> African Trade Unions. `` We completely reject the state president's plans to impose a general wage freeze.'' <PERSON> Meintjies </PERSON> said <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> may feel he can curb wages because black workers have no vote, `` but he will have to deal with other consequences _ the anger and confrontation of millions of workers crucially located at the point of production.'' The government imposed a wage freeze for public employees earlier this year as part of its campaign to curb the current 13.4 percent annual inflation rate. This drew bitter protests from white teachers and railway workers, among others. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> complained last week in Parliament that the private sector was not holding down salaries and said legislation was being drafted to force wage and price restraints. He said private employers were envisioning wage increases in the range of 15 percent. `` The reaction thus far from the private sector has been disappointing,'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said. `` It is becoming increasingly clear that this quid pro quo will not come about by means of persuasion or voluntary teamwork. Other mechanisms will have to be found.'' Major business organizations expressed concern about <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s statement The chairman of a nationwide grocery store chain defended his company's recent decision to grant wage increases of up to 25 percent to the predominantly black work force. `` The bigger increases were confined to the most needy in the lower income groups,'' said <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> of Pick' n Pay. `` If we did not negotiate the recent increases in a responsible fashion ... we would have faced strikes which would have been far more costly in the long run.'' <PERSON> Mentjies </PERSON> said that if the government sought wage restraints, it `` should start by cutting salaries fo government ministers, directors and shareholders.'' `` The working class does not want to pay for the disasters of apartheid's political and economic system,'' <PERSON> Meintjies </PERSON> said. `` Employers will have to decide whether they will be browbeaten or use their clout to oppose the wage freeze.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> African Trade Unions, which claims 750,000 members, was the target of a government decree on Feb. 25 barring it from political activities. The federation, which has taken a militant and active stance against apartheid, is scheduled to hold a national assembly this weekend to discuss the ban. By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Younger </PERSON> said Monday that if fellow <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> member <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> adopts a policy of forcing visiting ships to say if they are carrying nuclear arms, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> will not be able to land troops there. `` If we can not send ships into that situation we clearly would not physically be able to deliver 13,500 British troops of the <LOCATION> U.K </LOCATION>. Mobile Force on site without ships to transport them,'' <PERSON> Younger </PERSON> told a luncheon for foreign correspondents. <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s conservative Prime Minister <PERSON> Poul </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON> has called an election for May 10 in a showdown with left-of-center foes over the nuclear issue and its effect on the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON> heads a minority coalition government. He called the election rather than implement a parliamentary vote that could have forced visiting warships to declare if they had nuclear arms. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> both refuse, as a matter of policy, to say if their warships carry nuclear arms. <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> is a key <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> country geographically. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is supposed to land reinforcements there as part of the defense strategy of the Western alliance. Privately, British officials have expressed concern that if <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> insists on a nuclear arms declaration, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> members with strong anti-nuclear sentiments, might follow suit. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have already stopped visits to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, a non-NATO member, because it insists that ships disclose the presence of nuclear arms on board. `` We and our <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> allies have a very firm policy that we never confirm or deny that any of our ships has nor has not got nuclear weapons on board,'' said Younger. `` It would be valuable information to the outside world to know either that they have or have not.''

<HEAD>Appeals Court Reverses Ruling on Documents in Teamsters Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal appeals court Monday threw out a lower court's order requiring government prosecutors to share secret documents with lawyers for indicted Teamsters President <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>. <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>'s defense has claimed that the government documents would prove his innocence. But a three-judge panel of the 6th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> unanimously agreed that <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> and two <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> union co-defendants had no constitutional right of access to the documents, overturning a ruling last year by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. Federal prosecutors argued that they should be permitted to keep the documents confidential until <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> and co-defendants <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, fellow officers of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>'s Teamsters Local 507, went on trial The trial is scheduled for July 12 in White's court. The three defendants were charged in a May 1986 indictment with arranging a $ 700,000 payroll-padding scheme that put `` ghost employees'' on the payroll of Local 507. <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>, 60, is secretary-treasurer of Local 507 as well as president of the 1.6 million-member <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> union. The defense has argued that the documents would show that <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> and the other defendants were serving as government informants and that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> had authorized the payroll-padding scheme. `` In essence, the district court concluded ... that the defense has a constitutional right to know the tactical strengths and weaknesses of the government's case against it,'' appeals Judge <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON> wrote for the 6th Circuit court. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has never held that the Constitution creates such a right and we do not believe that it exists,'' <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON> wrote. Defense lawyer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Climaco </PERSON>, contacted through his <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> office, said he was unaware of the ruling and declined immediate comment.

 An Italian priest said Monday he was held for 26 hours by rebels in northern <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> for denouncing `` crimes of the Contras.'' <PERSON> Ubaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gervasoni </PERSON>, 43, said <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> rebels abducted him on April 19 in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Algodon </LOCATION>, about 125 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Zelaya </LOCATION> province. In an interview, the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> priest said he had been threatened previously by Contra leaders in the region for having condemned `` assassinations and kidnappings by the Contras.'' <PERSON> Gervasoni </PERSON> has been based since January in nearby <LOCATION> Waslala </LOCATION>, on the border with <LOCATION> Matagalpa </LOCATION> state. He said that the day before his abduction, three peasants were kidnapped from a local church by the U.S.-backed rebels. One of them, <PERSON> Neris </PERSON> <PERSON> Robles </PERSON>, was found dead the next day, he said. `` They cut his throat,'' the priest said, adding that the whereabouts of the other two peasants was not known. `` Although they did not mistreat me physically and I was given food during my abduction of 26 hours, they kept me closed in the chapel of a church and sealed the doors with barbed wire,'' he said. `` They also threatened to send me to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> for the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- high command to judge me,'' he said. `` They accused me of political activity and of being with the Sandinistas, but my mission is apostolic and I denounced abuses on both sides.'' He said the rebels released him to another parish priest, <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Blandon </PERSON>, and a group of parishioners in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Algodon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Blandon </PERSON> had been held by the rebels for 10 days in January. The leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> and Contras, who have used bases in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, have fought for nearly seven years. They signed a temporary truce March 23. <PERSON> Gervasconi </PERSON> said there are many rebels in the region where he works and that the Sandinista army has withdrawn in the past month. A 60-day cease-fire went into effect on April 1. `` Since that date you do n't hear the sounds of combat and campesinos are confident that peace can be reached. Many of them are optimistic and are preparing to plant this winter,'' he said.

 Voters on Tuesday cast ballots for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in an election the governing <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was expected to win over a divided opposition. A few hours after the polls opened at 7 a.m. -LRB- 6 p.m. EDT Monday -RRB-, election officials said voting was progressing smoothly in fine spring weather. Police were on full alert. The polls close at 6 p.m. -LRB- 5 a.m. EDT Tuesday -RRB- and most results were expected to be known within hours. About 26.2 million people were registered to vote. At 9 a.m., election officials reported a 9.5 percent voter turnout, compared to 9.3 percent during the same period in the Dec. 16 presidential election. Despite the unexpectedly strong early turnout, election officials predicted the overall voting rate would not be high. Newspapers had predicted a turnout lower than the 89 percent in December balloting and 84 percent in the last parliamentary election in February 1985. The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>, who won the December election with 36 percent of the vote, was expected to win a majority in the 299-seat <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> with less than half of the popular vote. As in December, a split in the opposition vote was expected to help the governing party. Each side has accused the other of fomenting violence, and opposition leaders say more trouble may follow if people feel Tuesday's elections are rigged. Police fired tear gas Monday at about 1,500 students who protested in two cities. Authorities reported 90 cases of election-related violence during he 18-day campaign, with more than 150 people detained and 77 formally charged. Scores have been injured, but no exact count was available. At least 20 injuries were reported Monday. Press reports said 145,000 national police were on full alert with 55,000 assigned to the 13,812 polling stations. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s party says it provides the stability necessary for continued eonomic progress and the democratic reforms he has promised. The opposition, whose divisiveness cost it the advantage gained through widespread anti-government protests last summer, says victory by the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> means one-party dictatorship. Opposition leaders also have attacked the governing party about an embezzlement scandal in which former President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON>'s younger brother has been arrested A few dozen of the 224 single-member election districts are seen as opposition strongholds, but many others have one government candidate running against two rivals from the opposition. Spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> say they hope to win about 125 districts, along with about 38 of the 75 seats to be awarded on the basis of a party's share of the vote nationwide. It held 160 of the 276 seats in the last <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, chosen in 1985. Under a new constitution that took effect in February, when <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> began his five-year term, the new assembly will serve for four years and has the power to investigate government actions. The president no longer can dissolve it. Opposition and government parties have traded charges of vote-buying and the South Korean press has reported widespread irregularities. <PERSON> Chai </PERSON> <PERSON> Mun-shik </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement Monday that candidate <PERSON> Kwon </PERSON> <PERSON> Joong-dong </PERSON> was expelled after prosecutors displayed 1,345 envelopes, each containing 20,000 won -LRB- $ 27 -RRB- and campaign leaflets for <PERSON> Kwon </PERSON>. <PERSON> Chai </PERSON> apologized to the nation for <PERSON> Kwon </PERSON>'s `` betrayal of party principles of fair elections.'' Supporters of the opposition said they found thousands of the envelopes Sunday night at a post office in <LOCATION> Andong </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Prosecutors later ordered the arrests of two ruling party supporters in <LOCATION> Andong </LOCATION> on charges of trying to buy votes for <PERSON> Kwon </PERSON> with about 85 million won -LRB- $ 114,865 -RRB- found in 4,296 envelopes at a post office, the Korean news agency <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> reported. Police said they had detained 173 people in connection with non-violent violations of election law and formally charged 120. Actions involved include tearing down or pasting over election posters and producing allegedly slanderous campaign leaflets. Firebombs and rocks have been thrown at campaign rallies and political party offices. Supporters of rival candidates have fought in the streets over such things as the content of campaign leaflets and placement or removal of posters.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said Monday that <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s banks could immediately resume offering a dozen services that had been suspended following <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> actions directed against this nation's economy. The services include handling letters of credit, collecting outstanding loans and transferring funds within the country. The commission called resumption of the 12 services `` an important and decisive step in the gradual and ordered process'' toward normal banking operations. The nation's banks closed March 4 because there was not enough cash to cover withdrawals. Some banks reopened last week, but only to accept deposits. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s civilian chief executive, <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>, met earlier Monday with new Cabinet members and other advisers in a renewed effort to find a way out of the deepening financial and political crisis. <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> named seven new ministers to the 12-member Cabinet on Sunday night, three of them to sensitive posts in foreign and economic policy. He said the chief task would be to achieve full resumption of banking services. Several diplomats and other observers said privately the new ministers appeared to be technocrats without sharply defined political leanings. <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>, considered to be a leftist, said he had no plans to interfere with private business or industry. He said he is willing to talk with opponents, but not if they continue demanding the resignation of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who commands the military and police and has the real power in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` What we will not do is surrender before the start of battle,'' the acting president said. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is under indictment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug trafficking charges, accusations which he denies. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has been trying to oust him since since last summer, applying a series of sanctions that have paralyzed the economy. <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s new foreign minister, said Monday in an interview at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that his top priorities are normalizing relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and persuading it to lift its economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON>, scheduled to return to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> on Tuesday, had served as <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador for the past 14 months. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, an opposition leader said a group of Panamanian dissidents is planning a military operation against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> by next week. Ambassador <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON>, who has remained loyal to ousted President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, told reporters the group is made up of very knowledgeable officers who have many friends in the Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, which <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> commands. <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> gave no details, but the group apparently includes high-ranking defectors who went to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> soon after <PERSON> Noreiga </PERSON> deposed <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> on Feb. 26. <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> said the first task of his new education minister would be to dismantle what he called the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rumors </ORGANIZATION>. The latest rumors had said his new appointees would be leftist ideologues. `` We are a capitalist group being attacked by other capitalists,'' <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> told a news conference soon after introducing his new Cabinet members. He also rejected earlier reports in state-run newspapers that called his new team a `` war cabinet.'' The new ministers replace officials <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> inherited when he replaced <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>. The National Assembly, dominated by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s supporters, ousted <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> a day after he tried to dismiss <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as commander of the Defense Forces <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>'s title is minister in charge of the presidency.

<TEXT>
 Government prosecutors said Monday they will oppose a bid to reopen the trial of the `` <ORGANIZATION> Sharpeville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Six </ORGANIZATION>,'' a group of blacks convicted of complicity in a mob killing and sentenced to death. <PERSON> P.J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Zyl </PERSON>, registrar of the <ORGANIZATION> Pretoria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, said the attorney general of <LOCATION> Transvaal </LOCATION> province had filed a notice of intention to oppose the defense lawyers' application to reopen the trial. He said a ruling was expected May 3. The defendants, five men and a woman, were granted a stay of execution on March 17, the day before they were scheduled to be hanged. The stay was ordered after their lawyers filed papers claiming a key state witness had been coerced by police into giving false testimony. Defense lawyers asked that the trial be reopened to consider that claim and to review the credibility of other state witnesses. Many human rights organizations and Western leaders have appealed to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s white-controlled government to commute the death sentences. The six were convicted of complicity in the September 1984 killing of a black municipal councilor, <PERSON> Kuzwayo </PERSON> <PERSON> Dhlamini </PERSON>, during riots against rent increases in the black township of <LOCATION> Sharpeville </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. But they were not found guilty of physically contributing to <PERSON> Dhlamini </PERSON>'s death. They were convicted under the doctrine of common purpose, which holds defendants responsible if they are found to be participants in mob violence. The government has said their conduct inluded throwing stones at <PERSON> Dhlamini </PERSON>, helping set his house afire and slapping a woman who begged the crowd not to burn him. Black government employees frequently are targets of militants battling to overthrow the government and its policy of apartheid. By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>Row Between Greece, Turkey Blocks EEC Meeting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LUXEMBOURG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A row over <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> on Monday between <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> and Turkish officials led to cancellation of a <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> meeting, according to diplomats. `` This is a very serious matter,'' said one diplomat after an announcement that the <ORGANIZATION> Turkey-EEC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> meeting was called off. An <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> official, who like the diplomats spoke on condition of anonymity, said the <LOCATION> Turkish </LOCATION> delegation refused to take part in the meeting as a protest of the agenda's mentioning the Turkish occupation of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. He said the <LOCATION> Turkish </LOCATION> delegation agreed to discuss political cooperation with the Community over dinner, but would not attend the talks themselves. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> failed to resolve the problem after more than three hours of closed-door negotiations and postponed the meeting indefinitely. <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Hans-Jurgen </PERSON> <PERSON> Chroborg </PERSON> said <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which holds the rotating EEC presidency until the end of June, hopes to reschedule the meeting before its term expires. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Mesut </PERSON> <PERSON> Yilmaz </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Turkish </LOCATION> delegation chief, was angered over <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>'s insistence on including the Turkish occupation of northern <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> statement adopted by the Community's foreign ministers earlier Monday. The statement said <LOCATION> Ankara </LOCATION>'s occupation of the east <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> island has a `` bearing'' on the Community's relations with <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. The Community went into the meeting with a broad declaration `` taking note'' of <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s desire to improve relations with the 12-nation Common Market. <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> wanted the talks to help release a long-frozen EEC development credit of $ 748 million. It also wanted a discussion of the free movement of Turkish workers in the Community and the removal of restrictions on Turkish imports. <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> financial aid to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> was frozen since the military coup in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> in 1980. Despite a recent thaw in its relations with <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> said last week it would block the funding until Turkish troops were withdrawn from <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. It also said it wants improved treatment of the Greek minority in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. Turkish military forces invaded northern <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> in July 1974 and a Turkish federated state of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> was set up after <LOCATION> Ankara </LOCATION> said the Turkish Cypriot minority there was threatened following a military coup in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. Greek Cypriots outnumber Turkish Cypriots on the island by more than four to one.

 A 4-month-old baby taken from a hospital was found safe Monday, and a woman authorities said had impersonated a relative to gain access to the child was charged with kidnapping. LaShae Cherry, taken Saturday from <LOCATION> Children </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, was found at a house in north <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> after several tipsters called the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's just like a miracle to me,'' the baby's mother, 18-year-old <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> <PERSON> Cherry </PERSON>, said at a news conference at the hospital. `` She started smiling and everything.'' <PERSON> Cherylle </PERSON> <PERSON> Staley </PERSON>, 21, was charged with kidnapping, criminal trespass, unlawful restraint, interference with custody of a child and recklessly endangering another person, police Capt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Deeds </PERSON> said. She was expected to be arraigned later Monday night or early Tuesday, Deeds said. A man who was at the home when the baby was found was not charged, police said. Authorities said Ms. <PERSON> Staley </PERSON> carried the baby out the hospital Saturday after she impersonated an aunt. The baby, dressed in new clothes, was recovered without incident. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> assistant special agent <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> said his office received several calls about a woman claiming to have had a baby, `` and this was found to be rather unbelievable -LRB- to callers -RRB- and this was reported to us.'' <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, asked about a motive, said `` there was some feeling of having to produce a child.'' A doctor at the hospital said the baby was returned wearing clean clothes and apparently had been bathed recently. `` She received good care over the last 50 hours,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedland </PERSON>, pediatrician on duty in the hospital's emergency room when <PERSON> LaShae </PERSON> was brought in. LaShae sat quietly during the press conference, gurgling and sucking on her fist. `` As soon as she saw me she just laughed,'' Ms. <PERSON> Cherry </PERSON> said. She said she had become convinced Sunday night her baby had been sold by the woman who took her. LaShae had been at the hospital since April 18 for treatment of pneumonia and diarrhea, according to hospital officials. She was scheduled to be released Saturday.

Last July, three officials in charge of the plant during the accident were convicted of gross negligence and sentenced to 10 years in a labor camp. Pravda said on Sunday that during the last two years engineering jobs at the plant have been handed out to medics, teachers, veterinarians and people without any higher education. It also accused Chernobyl's managers of trying to `` resolve at any cost'' obstacles to full electricity production at the plant `` to the detriment of the quality of repair and maintenance of extremely intricate equipment.''

 There wo n't be any elephants but there will be a cast of 600 performing for an arena seating 15,000 people in this summer's `` Aida'' extravaganza at Earl's Hall. It is the largest opera setting ever in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. The cavernous hall, also used for ice shows and pop concerts, covers 12 acres and was the largest reinforced concrete building in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> when it was built in 1937. Its seating capacity is six times greater than the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opera </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in Covent Garden, and ticket prices at $ 40 and $ 47.50 are about half the price of good seats at the opera house. Public fascination with <PERSON> Giuseppe </PERSON> <PERSON> Verdi </PERSON>'s opera, first performed in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> in 1871, abounds. `` The tickets are going so well that we have extended the run from six nights to seven,'' said <PERSON> Lilian </PERSON> <PERSON> Hochhauser </PERSON>, who with her husband, <PERSON> Victor </PERSON>, heads one of three groups of impresarios who got together to stage `` Aida'' at <PERSON> Earl </PERSON>'s Court near <LOCATION> Kensington </LOCATION> in west <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The triumphal procession in `` Aida'' has included elephants in some productions but animals were turned down for <PERSON> Earl </PERSON>'s Court. `` Elephants in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> are totally, historically inaccurate, and camels were not originally known there either,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Hochhauser </PERSON> said. `` Everybody wants animals but I think perhaps it's better not to start.'' Asked about a newspaper report that the impresarios expect a $ 2 million profit, she said, `` Nothing like that, and you can say I laughed hysterically.'' She also declined to say how much the production would cost. `` We do n't know what to expect because production costs have risen so enormously. This is unknown territory. There's never been an opera at <PERSON> Earl </PERSON>'s Court before and never one in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> on this scale,'' she said. `` I think there are thousands of people who are intrigued by opera and would like to hear one. But they are put off by the price and the lower-cost seats always sell out quickly. `` They feel an opera house is not their world, but they would feel more at home in a place like <PERSON> Earl </PERSON>'s Court,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Hochhauser </PERSON> said the Royal Opera and its rival, the English National Opera, toyed over the years with the idea of going to <PERSON> Earl </PERSON>'s Court. `` But they never came up with a solution to the set problem _ they did n't have one to fit,'' she said. American mezzo-soprano <PERSON> Grace </PERSON> <PERSON> Bumbry </PERSON> will portray Aida on opening night and give one extra performance, while other international stars will rotate in the leading roles. The production is the idea of Italian director and designer <PERSON> Vittorio </PERSON> <PERSON> Rossi </PERSON>, who has put on similar shows in indoor stadiums in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>. `` Aida,'' the grandest of grand operas, tells of the love of Radames, captain of the Pharaoh's guard, for Aida, a slave and daughter of the king of <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> whom <PERSON> Radames </PERSON> has captured. Radames, tricked into betraying military secrets, is buried alive and <PERSON> Aida </PERSON> chooses to die with him. The tricky task of projecting the singer's voices to all parts of the hall is being solved by having the singers wear tiny radio microphones. The producers say the distances are so great that the mikes are unlikely to be visible. The <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Symphony Orchestra will perform with 85 musicians conducted by <PERSON> Nello </PERSON> <PERSON> Santi </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ballet </LOCATION> is also taking part as well as the Ambrosian Opera Chorus of 200. The production opens on Sunday June 26 and runs through Saturday July 2.

 A white elephant in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> is not anything you blithely unload. White elephants here are revered and pampered as national treasures. <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> today is the home of the white elephant believed to have given rise years ago to the term `` white elephant'' of the other kind. But Thais do n't demean the beasts by calling them white elephants. They call them `` Auspiciously Significant Elephants.'' They are modern <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s link to the days when kings rode elephants into battle and fought over the white ones. White elephants today reside in finely appointed stables, are assigned two caretakers each and daily consume up to 660 pounds of specially purchased greenery, garnished with papayas, bananas and other elephant delicacies. White elephants are by law offered to the king and the current monarch, <PERSON> Bhumibol </PERSON> <PERSON> Adulyadej </PERSON>, has 11 of them. They make themselves very much at home around his palace, strolling on manicured lawns, bathing in a lake and liberally stripping the royal foliage. White elephants, which are said to bestow good fortune on their owners, do n't come without expense. The herd does n't earn its keep, which includes of food bill equivalent to several thousand dollars a month. Hence the term `` white elephant'' as used elsewhere to mean a possession maintained at very high expense with very little in return. While the term in that sense is n't used in the Thai language, the English one may have originated from the practice of old Thai monarchs giving white elephants to nobles. Such gifts could hardly be refused and the creatures proceeded to eat their masters out of house and home. In former times _ the earliest records of their capture date to the 15th century _ white elephants bathed behind a screen to protect them from commoners' eyes. Kings of <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Siam </LOCATION> in those days -RRB- and <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> went to war over them. Beliefs, some still extant, grew up around them. Ailing children, it is said, can be cured by walking or crawling under their bellies. The hair from the tails of white elephants, incorporated into rings, can ward off evil. The fortunes of all elephants have since declined in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. Massive deforestation has dramatically depleted the wild population to probably fewer than 2,000. Modern machines and roads have reduced elephants' usefulness in the logging industry and as beasts of burden. Domesticated elephants, which numbered nearly 13,500 in 1950, are down to fewer than 4,000 today. Roundups in the jungles, royal processions of caparisoned animals, the thundering charges of elephants in battle have been replaced by spectacles that some traditionalists regard as less than dignified. Today, elephants play soccer, take part in mock combat and lift their trunks on command in hotel reception areas for the amusement of tourists. Only a few outsiders are allowed into the stables of the white elephants at <LOCATION> Chitralada </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Villa </LOCATION>, where the animals, ranging in age from 10 to 59 years, are protected from undue stress, disease and any would-be human predators. Killing a white elephant is punishable by five years in prison. <PERSON> Phiphatanachatr </PERSON> <PERSON> Diskul </PERSON>, a veterinarian assigned to the white elephants' medical care, said the elephants get a blood test every six months and are given medicines and vitamins as needed. Initially, the keepers tried to sneak pills into bananas, sticky rice and other food but since the animals gingerly discarded them, a 4 -LCB- - inch syringe now is used To warrant such attention, an elephant must have 11 special characteristics including whitish eyes and a pinkish palette. White elephants, or albinos, are rarely if ever all white but rather mottled with off-whites and other skin tones other than the standard elephant gray. Once such an elephant is found, the word makes its way up through official channels to the Royal Household in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. An expert is dispatched and looks for the requisite characteristics. He also assesses the beast's personality, bearing and even whether it possesses a pleasant-sounding snore. If those tests are met, he proclaims the animal an `` Auspiciously Significant Elephant.'' At a later date the king presides over an elaborate induction ceremony, the roots of which lie deep in Hindu and <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> lore. <PERSON> Sawej </PERSON> <PERSON> Thanapradit </PERSON>, an 82-year-old expert who has worked with royal elephants most of his life, said the traditions and rituals surrounding white elephants once also existed in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, formerly <ORGANIZATION> Ceylon </ORGANIZATION>. But political and social changes in those countries have turned royal white elephants into mere albinos. `` In <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, they will be with us a very long time,'' <PERSON> Sawej </PERSON> said, explaining that `` Auspiciously Significant Elephants'' are closely linked to the monarchy, which remains a vigorous institution.

<HEAD>Panama Low on Supplies and Prospects for More are Dim</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRIS ANGELO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 `` You can describe what is happening in the country like this,'' said the head of a major company as he drew a circle on a piece of paper. `` Have you ever seen a snake eating its tail?'' Trapped in the standoff between Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on one side and the local opposition and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration on the other, Panamanians are using up what little <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> has left, with dim prospects of getting more. `` The country is becoming paralyzed and now we are in the phase of eating up our inventories,'' said the Panamanian, who is the general manager of a major <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> company here. Like most businessmen here, he spoke only condition of anonymity because of the sensitive situation. `` There is going to be a total exhaustion of supplies on hand,'' he added. `` If we ca n't import raw materials, when the inventories run out we ca n't produce.'' Banks have been closed to the public by government order since March 4, because of cash shortages following months-long runs on accounts and a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> freeze on Panamanian assets as part of the plan to force <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> out as strongman. Without banks, the local economy runs on a cash-only basis. Even the most reliable customers have lost the credit they had with suppliers. Some Panamanian and foreign banks reopened April 18 but only to accept deposits. Except for some foods such as rice, an essential here, and a few manufactured goods, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> runs on imports. The situation became critical Feb. 26, the day <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> engineered the ouster of President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> for issuing an order firing the general. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had just been indicted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug trafficking charges. Hardly anyone seems to have escaped in the aftermath. _ Like everyone else, <PERSON> Harinas </PERSON> <PERSON> Panama </PERSON>, one of the country's three flour mills, ca n't buy wheat because its supplier wants cash for it General Manager <PERSON> Tirso </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfschoon </PERSON> said the company is negotiating to get more wheat, but then there might not be any bags to put the flour in. He said his suppliers are having trouble getting materials for cloth and plastic bags. _ An association of insurance companies announced it ca n't pay claims and its clients ca n't pay premiums _ Construction is virtually halted Equipment stands idle at the concrete skeletons of twin 24-story condominium towers on prime real estate. _ <ORGANIZATION> Colgate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palmolive </ORGANIZATION>, a wholly owned branch of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company, is selling from its inventories of toothpaste, detergents and other personal care and cleaning products Like many others companies, it has given its employees vacations, but General Manager <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said that when worker get back from their vacations, the factory will use up its inventories. `` The main problem will be the massive unemployment this can generate,'' he said. _ For 10 years <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> has been self-sufficient in rice, but growers say farmers are n't planting because of the lack of credit and uncertainty over whether they'll be able to get fertilizers and other chemicals Rice on hand normally would last through June or July, they say. But in the crisis, people are buying only essentials _ and rice is at the top of the list. _ Supermarkets are still well-stocked <PERSON> Nicolas </PERSON> <PERSON> Psychoyos </PERSON> of the Rey chain said sales are running at 40 percent of last year's. Some imported items, such as breakfast cereals, cooking oils and canned fruits, are running low, but local brands and all essentials are available. _ Activity in the cluster of white towers of the international banking center that grew up here in the 1970s is near a standstill According to one estimate, 50 to 70 of the 118 foreign banks have closed or are in the process of closing. Others say none have closed officially. Some Panamanian economists said they hold out hope that the center can revive, at least on some scale, but others say it is all but gone and that business is already moving to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Cayman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> south of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. To survive, the Panamanian business instinct has come up with some creative answers. Some companies, like <ORGANIZATION> Colgate </ORGANIZATION>, have been paying employees with as much cash as they can muster, giving it to the lowest-scale workers. The rest receive coupons to buy food at supermarkets. Supermarkets and some other businesses are accepting the paychecks of government employees and in turn using them to pay utility bills. Supermarkets also are accepting checks of low denominations from suppliers' employees, then returning them for supplies. Some businesses are resorting to barter. Psychoyos of the Rey supermarket chain said he has exchanged food or canceled overdue accounts for windows, doors, reinforcing rods, wood, cinder block, trucks of fruit and `` just about anything that has value to it.'' `` We'll find someone who needs them and pay them with that,'' he said. A beer distributor in the provinces accepted food in payment, then used the food to pay its employees. Even if the situation is resolved soon, recovery will take years and depend on the influx of foreign aid, according to businessmen and economists. Some Panamanians now question the economic pressure the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is using to force <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> out and reduce the role of his <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>. `` Right now, there's no winner in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' said one. `` We're all losers.

<HEAD>Argentine Government Runs Pro-Democracy Ads to Thwart Military</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDALL HACKLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Concerned that some military men might still be restless in the barracks, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s civilian government is running television spots to promote democracy. `` Democracy comes from a Greek word meaning people's choice,'' the narrator says solemnly in one of them. The commercials follow revolts at three army camps last year and similar uprisings three months ago at six army garrisons by the cashiered rebel leader Lt. Col. <PERSON> Aldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rico </PERSON>. The military, which has a history of intervention in government, turned government over to civilians in 1983 after ruling for seven years. President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> have began debate on a law to amend the Constitution to strengthen civilian rule and reform the military to keep the armed forces out of politics. `` This country is tired of the continous agitations provoked by a small group that does not represent the general sentiment in the armed forces,'' said <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cafiero </PERSON>, the governor of <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> province, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and a leading presidential candidate. No civilian president in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> has completed a full term in 60 years. The military has toppled governments here six times since 1930, most recently when <PERSON> Isabel </PERSON> <PERSON> Peron </PERSON> was ousted in 1976 as the successor to her husband, President <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peron </PERSON>. <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> has 20 months left in his six-year term. But recent events indicate domestic instability. Recent terrorist bombings in this capital and <LOCATION> Cordoba </LOCATION> wounded four people, including two federal policemen. One terrorist suspect was killed by police. Pro-Rico graffiti has spread from shantytowns outside <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> to downtown, near the seat of government. `` Rico is a patriot,'' `` Rico is God'' and `` Rico is freedom,'' the graffiti says. Rico is being held pending rebellion charges in the <LOCATION> Magdalena </LOCATION> military prison 62 miles south of <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>. The prison is where five former military leaders, including two military ex-presidents, also are held. The five leaders of the former military junta were convicted by the <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> government for their roles in human rights abuses during <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s `` dirty war,'' a campaign waged in the late 1970s by the military against alleged leftist subversion. At least 9,000 civilians vanished without a trace, according to a government panel, but human rights groups say the number of people abducted, tortured and ultimately `` disappeared'' is closer to 30,000. A year ago flashing TV spots saying `` Democracy or Dictatorship'' urged civilians to take to the streets to show support of the government during military uprisings April 15-21 in <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cordoba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tucuman </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> won the surrender of Rico at <LOCATION> Campo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mayo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s largest army base in suburban <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>, and told 400,000 people assembled in the central Plaza <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayo </PERSON>, `` The house is in order and no blood was shed. When new rebel uprisings in January ended after 96 hours with <PERSON> Rico </PERSON>'s surrender again, <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> said, `` We have again put our house in order.'' But in the past year, conditions have worsened on the economic and social fronts. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> had to renegotiate its $ 54.3 billion foreign debt, third-largest in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and inflation has run at a rate of 206 percent in the 12-month period. Workers are restive because their wages buy less and less, and <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>'s party was routed in congressional and gubernatorial elections by the resurgent Peronists. Human rights groups such as the Mothers of the <LOCATION> Plaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mayo </LOCATION>, made up of relatives who lost loved ones in the `` dirty war,'' charged <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> caved in to <PERSON> Rico </PERSON> and that he pushed a law through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that pardoned most officers accused of rights atrocities. Rico, meanwhile, has attracted support from rightist groups such as <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alert </ORGANIZATION>, an organization that favors a return to military rule. Three army officers have gone underground since February, announcing they sided with <PERSON> Rico </PERSON> and planned to fight what they described as the `` Marxist enemy.'' <PERSON> Rico </PERSON> maintains the military should not be penalized for tactics he described as necessary in its 1970s war against subversion or be blamed for the embarrassing loss to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in the 1982 Falklands War. While Rico has found support among younger, mid-level army officers, he is the butt of many local jokes, particularly about his surrendering after vowing to `` fight to the finish.'' Argentines say <PERSON> Rico </PERSON> has broken an unofficial record by surrendering three times in six years, first during the Falklands War, where he was a decorated commando, and twice at his own rebellions.

Nearby, looking down at her in the excavation, stood another little girl, this one from the modern village that had been built atop the ancient <LOCATION> Saar </LOCATION> burial mounds where the chiseled stone was found in February. The village girl's hair was cut short, like that of the girl in stone; they could have been sisters had they not been born 20 centuries apart. The `` little girl tombstone'' is one of five identified as belonging to the Tylos culture that existed on this island in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> around the time of Christ. The thousands of ancient graves on <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, 30 miles long and 10 miles across at its widest point, once gave rise to a theory that it was used as a regional burying ground. However, the Danish archaeologist <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> <PERSON> Frolich </PERSON>, among others, says, `` There is no existing evidence that requires us to assume that the dead were anything other than inhabitants of <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> island.'' Over the years, many of these burial sites have been obliterated by population and urban growth, a process that continues. The Saar mounds are being excavated under pressure from developers who own the property and are impatient to have it cleared. `` Our problem is that the construction of new buildings is coming very quickly,'' said <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> <PERSON> Sowaileh </PERSON>, the superintendent of archaeology. `` <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> would like to build houses, houses. And everywhere you dig in <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, you will find some evidence of the prehistoric or ancient past. `` So we ca n't preserve all the mounds, but we try to do our best to preserve as many as we can.'' At this site, known as the `` baby grave,'' 85 graves radiate from the center of a giant burial mound, with the most recent at the outer edges. Thirty-five jars containing skeletal remains of infants were also found here, giving the site its name. <PERSON> Sowaileh </PERSON> said some burial jars, pottery and skeletal remains probably will be removed and exhibited in <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>'s new national museum. Ancient writings suggest <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> may have been the Garden of Eden described in the Old Testament. The Sumerians of what is now southern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> knew the island as <PERSON> Dilmun </PERSON>, during the Bronze Age, some 4,500 years ago. Succeeding cultures built atop earlier ones, making this a rich area for archaeologists. Although most of the Saar mounds, a few miles west of <LOCATION> Manama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>'s main city, are older, this particular site dates from the Greco-Roman period, 200 B.C.-200 A.D., when the island was called Tylos. For centuries, <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, which is near the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>'s western shore, has been a stopping-off place for traders, merchants, pirates and armies on the move. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> the Great never reached <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> during 13 years of conquering the world as he knew it, but some of his generals did. Along with skeletal remains, the contents of other graves escaped pillage over the years. One family mound has yielded a trove of about 1,000 items _ necklaces, glazed pottery and glassware, some in relatively good condition. The mounds are rounded cones, enclosing burial chambers or grave complexes. From afar, they resemble giant anthills. Up close, they are distinguished from natural formations by their even appearance. Some rise to about six feet, others are at ground level. At this site, the chambers are generally below ground, cut into bedrock. <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> still has about 100,000 known burial mounds. In 1880, a British officer-explorer, <PERSON> E.L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Durand </PERSON>, wrote in his journal: `` Mighty mounds, bare of vegetation, tower above the palm groves. Mass upon mass, mound upon mound, they stretch on in endless chains all round the slope that falls from the cliffs to the sea.'' The 30 Tylos mounds, of which the family site is one, could prove important in the study of the Tylos civilization. <PERSON> Sowaileh </PERSON> said it shows, for example, that people of that time made glazed pottery. `` We also notice a change in burial customs from this period,'' he said. `` People are buried clothed, their positions are changed, so they are placed on their backs, and put into some kind of coffin. We did n't see these things before the Greeks came to <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>.'' He said the discovery of more than 300 silver Greek coins, some bearing the likeness of <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> the </PERSON> <PERSON> Great </PERSON>, indicate that ancient Tylos, like modern <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, was a flourishing trade center. Sowaileh, surveying the gravesite as he spoke, said the craftsmanship of such artifacts as the `` little girl tombstone'' is local. `` There are other tombstones, very similar to this one, that have inscriptions in Greek, and must have been made for the <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> people living here at the time. But they do n't have the facial representation like this one,'' he said of the little girl in stone. The little girl from the village had wandered off by now to rejoin her playmates digging in dirt piled near the mound. Her past is only now being discovered.

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ Are minority students, especially blacks, getting a fair shake at college? While it's not like the old days of overt discrimination, recent incidents indicating recurring racism have prompted soul-searching at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> and other institutions. One thing is certain: The enrollment of blacks has been dropping and expressions of discontent have been rising.

 From random insults on the street to graffiti in dorms to fistfights on fraternity row, <PERSON> black </PERSON> students say, part of their education at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin-Madison </ORGANIZATION> is learning how to deal with racism. <PERSON> Geneva </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, 23, co-president of the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, has received hate mail and heard herself called a `` spook'' and `` jungle bunny.'' `` This environment is hostile to blacks,'' she says. `` There is no reason for any black person to come here or stay here.'' <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashby </PERSON>, 21, who came to <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION> on a football scholarship from <LOCATION> Portsmouth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, says, `` It was a severe culture shock. I went from a community where everyone I saw was black to being a total minority.'' After five years, the senior says, `` I still find it very stressful. I'm in a zoology class of 500 where I am the only black student.'' There are 722 blacks among Madison's 43,368 students, or 1.66 percent. That is down from 906 seven years ago, when blacks comprised 2.3 percent of the students. It's among the smallest percentages of any major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> university. Racial incidents have erupted into protests on other campuses, from the 1986 World Series dispute that spilled over into a racial brawl at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts-Amherst </ORGANIZATION> to protests at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan-Ann </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arbor </ORGANIZATION> over racist jokes on a campus radio station to a furor over a fraternity sex show at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION>. At <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, 89 activists, most of them black, were arrested in April for occupying a building in a protest over that institution's failure to achieve a court-ordered goal of 5 percent black enrollment. Some 2,424, or 3.6 percent, of <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s 67,278 students are black. <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s president, <PERSON> Bryce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, later dropped the charges. The upsurge in racial incidents and strife, coupled with lagging black enrollments on many campuses, is prompting many colleges to mount new drives to achieve minority hiring and enrollment gains that have eluded them in the past. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwell </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, says, `` We have hit the wall on minority participation and are loath to face the tough road ahead. Our own inner fatigue has been accentuated by an administration that has not seen equity issues as important.'' The council has enlisted former Presidents Carter and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> as co-chairman of a blue-ribbon commission that will issue a report this spring on problems that may lie ahead for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> if more minorities do n't graduate from college. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, president of the 26-campus <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> system, which has only 3,190 blacks among its 161,887 students, says, `` This is n't a Sunday school lesson we're talking about. We're approaching a situation by the year 2000 where a third of our young people going into the work force are going to be minorities. We ca n't afford for them to undereducated.'' The extent of educators' concern was evident at a recent videoconference on racism on campuses. The conference was organized by the <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and seen by 11,000 people on 176 campuses. In panel discussions at the <ORGANIZATION> Wingspread </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Racine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, and interviews on the <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION> campus and elsewhere, experts agreed that today's racial problems are different from the outright legal discrimination that once kept black students from college campuses. <PERSON> Reginald </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, who directs the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minority </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Concerns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, says much of the student protest arises from `` a wellspring of alienation'' fed by `` day-to-day kind of indignities'' inside and outside the classroom. He says that in student surveys 70 percent of minority students will say, ` We've got real problems,' while 70 percent of white students will say, ` This is a wonderful place.''' <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> sociologist, said, `` It is the casualness -LRB- of racism -RRB-, the fact that it is built into <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> society, that makes it such a continuing problem and so hard to deal with. It's the little flick, flick, flicks that hurt, not the one blow.'' While <PERSON> Atwell </PERSON> and others view Hispanic enrollment rates as `` abysmally low,'' it is the rate among blacks that has attracted the most attention. And it has been blacks who have been subjected to most widely noted incidents of racism on campuses. According to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> black </PERSON> college enrollments fell almost 3 percent between 1980 and 1984, but increased slightly by 1986, the latest year for which the figures are available. The department says its survey indicated there were 1,081,000 blacks enrolled in fall 1986, down from the peak of 1,107,000 in 1980. But over the past decade the black share of enrollment has sagged from 9.4 percent to 8.6 percent. At the same time, <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> figures show, the percentage of black high school graduates ages 18 to 24 enrolled in college dropped from 33.5 percent in 1976 to 26.1 percent in 1985. Only 26.1 percent of the black high school graduates attended college, down from a peak of 33.5 percent in 1976, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. `` The main problem of access is the kid who does n't have the stuff to go,'' says Education Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>. Among students with similar academic achievements, `` black students are just as likely or more likely than white students to go to college.'' `` Most higher education institutions have been diligent about recruiting black students ...'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> says. `` The most serious underlying barrier to greater <PERSON> black </PERSON> college enrollment is the need to enlarge the pool of black students who have had the right preparation.'' Black men, in particular, are passing up college. They were outnumbered by <PERSON> black </PERSON> <PERSON> female </PERSON> college students, 645,000 to 436,000, in 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> says. In 1985, 34,455 black women received bachelor's degrees, 3 percent more than in 1976. But the number of black male graduates, 23,018, was down 10 percent for that same period.

 Overall black enrollment in the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> system has slid 15 percent since 1980. Other states are wrestling with similar figures. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s nine state colleges and universities, black undergraduate enrollment dropped from 18,366 in 1980 to 14,237 in 1985. In <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, 1,975 blacks were enrolled in colleges and universities in 1986, down from 2,213 in 1980. <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, the president of the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> system, kicked up a storm last November by proposing free tuition for all minorities who maintained a C-plus average in core academic subjects in high school. The idea drew fire from many sides, including minority leaders at the <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION> campus who feared it would arouse new enmity against blacks and other minority students. Some said C-plus students did n't deserve scholarships. In a revised `` Design for Diversity,'' <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> has proposed doubling minority enrollments by 1993 in part with $ 1,700-a-year grants available to 500 disadvantaged <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> residents _ not just minorities. <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> also wants to raise minority faculty and staff hiring by 75 percent, and to groom 15 new minority Ph.D. s each year for teaching jobs in the system The total price tag over four years is nearly $ 17 million. <ORGANIZATION> Shaw </ORGANIZATION> builds on the so-called Madison Plan that new <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> Chancellor <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shalala </PERSON> unveiled in February, six weeks after arriving in <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION> and finding on her desk a thick pile of recommendations from a student-faculty Steering Committee on Minority Affairs. <PERSON> Shalala </PERSON>, a one-time <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration housing official, came to <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> by way of the presidency of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hunter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, where 60 percent of the 19,000 students are minorities. Her blueprint, fashioned after a frenetic round of meetings with faculty, student, staff and community leaders, calls for doubling freshman minority enrollment by 1993, hiring 70 new minority faculty over the next three years and 125 minority staff members. At <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Faculty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> reversed itself last month following faculty and student protests and required each of the institution's more than 50 departments to hire one more black faculty member by 1993. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> faculty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> senate </ORGANIZATION> is being asked to approve an ethnic studies course requirement, and <PERSON> Shalala </PERSON>'s administration endorsed construction of a multicultural center for students _ although not one left solely in the hands of minority students, as activists had called for <PERSON> Shalala </PERSON> found $ 1.6 million in existing funds to launch the plan, and is asking the state legislature for $ 4.7 million more for its first three years. Some of the money will go into financial aid for the disadvantaged. Big debts have become a routine part of college life for many students in the past decade with the federal government shifting its emphasis from grants to loans. Many educators suspect that is a prime reason why the black share of college enrollment has dropped. They say the military is also recruiting a growing share of black high school graduates with its promise of both training and a paycheck. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, 23, minority affairs director for the <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, says, `` A lot of people just do n't feel like going out and taking out $ 20,000 in loans. That's what I've had to do.'' `` Then there's the Army: ` Be all you can be.' It's tempting,'' says <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, a senior from <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> who is one of 11 children. `` I know people who have college degrees who ca n't buy a job, and I know people who got jobs out of high school and are making money I dream of.'' Fellow senior <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashby </PERSON> says, `` A lot of people see this high level of education as superfluous. They'd much rather get into the job force right after high school. A lot of the trade skills are making much more money than people with a bachelor of arts degree.'' <PERSON> Ashby </PERSON> has worked summers in the shipyards back in <LOCATION> Portsmouth </LOCATION> as an $ 8-an-hour painter, and has seen buddies who chose not to return to college. `` The future may be somewhat limited,'' he says, but the jobs pay more than beginning teachers make. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Holley </PERSON>, 23, from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, also a senior political science major and co-president of the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, says, `` I do n't think Madison has a good image in terms of black students. Everybody who has friends who go to <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION> knows there is nothing for you to do if you're black up here. There's no black music ... The social life is essentially null and void.'' <PERSON> Shalala </PERSON> says, `` What I want to do is make this place more like the real world, more multi-ethnic, more multicultural. There is a new generation of leaders, not only in higher education, but in this society. We have come up through the civil rights movement, through the peace movement and through the women's movement ... Twenty years ago, I was one of those demonstraters and I promised myself if I ever got into a position of power, I would be different in the way in which I led an institution. The 47-year-old <PERSON> Shalala </PERSON> says <PERSON> Madison </PERSON> will build its minority enrollment numbers `` the hard way,'' including finding transfer students and older students, and recruiting heavily in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> _ something it has not been doing. <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>'s population is 3.8 percent black. `` I have to be real careful,'' <PERSON> Shalala </PERSON> says. `` I ca n't be so hungry for minorities that we bring in kids that really ca n't make it here ... We're not in the remedial business.'' She notes that on the same day the conference on campus racism was held at <LOCATION> Wingspread </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was overriding President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto of the Civil Rights Restoration Act, which bars discrimination in federally subsidized institutitons `` That is very important for universities,'' she says. `` It holds us accountable for every department and every program.'' The success or failure of higher education's current drive to improve the racial climate and minority participation on campuses will also be affected by `` who's elected president -LRB- and -RRB- what tone is set,'' <PERSON> Shalala </PERSON> says. `` We're not going to make deep inroads until we change the way in which we run urban schools in this country.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ In <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, birthplace of the oil industry, pumping crude and gas is a way of life for many small operators. They're not about to yield to regulators whose environmental rules, they say, are ruinously adding to their costs, even if it makes them look like moonshiners.

 Falling oil prices and tough new environmental regulations have <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> producing oil like a bootlegger working a still. `` We're running illegal,'' says <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, a short, stocky man who fiercely protects his 150 oil wells from inquisitive state officials. `` Every time my black lab barks, I look to see whether it's the law. It's just like moonshining. But what choice do we have?'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> refuses to register his wells with state authorities. `` If they have a problem,'' he says, `` they should know where the problem is.'' So far he's managed to avoid investigators because of spotty enforcement and legal challenges to the new regulations. `` It's not a matter of being a hero or a smart aleck,'' he says, referring to his candor. `` It's just a matter of trying to survive.'' Defiance is not uncommon among small producers in this, the oldest oil and gas field in the world. Here the first oil well was drilled in 1859 and the first gas well in 1868. Operating on the shady side of the law may mean the difference between making a living and going bankrupt, says <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>. He estimates it would cost him about $ 100,000 to be `` legal.'' Complying with state regulations, which include a $ 25,000 bond and expensive rules for discharging brine and plugging unused wells, may cost more than the $ 5-a-day revenues realized from the average oil well and $ 8 a day from the average gas well in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. The regulations probably would have gone down easier had they not accompanied the worst price collapse in the history of the energy industry _ a collapse that has hurt the nation's other 32 oil and gas producing states as well. `` This has been the worst depression in the oil industry since the 1930s,'' says <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, which represents 7,000 independent oil and gas producers. `` A lot of independents are struggling.'' About 20 miles away, near the village of <LOCATION> Knox </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Stover </PERSON> maneuvers his four-wheel-drive pickup up a steep, rutted trail to check for the last time on wells that have been oozing fuel as predictably as Old Faithful for almost 100 years. In this pristine setting, populated by wild turkeys, deer, black bear and grouse, forests of hemlocks and mountain laurel camouflage one of the most densely developed natural gas areas in the state. Many of the wells are still flowing, although at low volumes, kept alive by thousands of small operators like <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stover </PERSON>. Small producers started the oil and gas industry more than 120 years ago. They're the wildcatters who explored new oil fields, drilled new gas wells and resurrected abandoned sites. And even in these times of multinational conglomerates, their low-volume wells, called stripper wells, still make up three-quarters of the nation's total `` You ca n't afford to drill a new well to get 10 gallons of oil a day. But if you can sell 10 gallons of oil at a decent price, you can pump that well indefinitely,'' says <PERSON> Stover </PERSON>, a trim man of 54 who's been producing gas for 20 years. But while the world's appetite for gas and oil continues to grow, a host of problems, including rock-bottom prices, stringent environmental regulations, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> oil and restricted pipelines, have forced the grandchildren of the energy pioneers out of business. `` You know, everybody would like to own an oil well. Everybody thinks that all you need is an oil well to be rich. But that's the farthest thing from the truth,'' said <PERSON> Stover </PERSON>. He recently turned off his 97 gas wells after his main customer, a glass plant, went out of business. `` Three years ago I had an offer of $ 750,000 for my wells. Today, I do n't think I could give them away.'' In 1986, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil dropped to $ 10 a barrel from a March 1981 high of $ 34.70, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. Currently prices hover around $ 14.25 a barrel for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude and $ 16 for <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Grade crude, a paraffin-based oil prized for its lubricating qualities. For the state's stripper wells, which average one-third a barrel per day, or 14 gallons, the yield is about $ 5 a day, a mere drop in the bucket compared to the 200 barrels daily produced by a typical medium-sized oil well in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. `` Legislators think in barrels, and we talk gallons. That's why it takes so many wells to survive,'' says <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, 45, who owns several 100-year-old wells.

<HEAD>OIL CITY, Pa.: 100-year-old wells.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Natural gas rates vary widely, depending on the contracts producers have with their customers, but generally they average about $ 2.30 per thousand cubic feet in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. Stripper gas wells yield about 3,500 cubic feet a day, about $ 8, according to <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhoads </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Oil and <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is a technical business,'' <PERSON> Stover </PERSON> says. `` I do n't mean to overplay it, but if someone gave the average guy 10 oil wells and he attempted to produce them, he'd be a lot poorer at the end of two years than if he did n't do anything. It takes a lot of innovation and technical savvy to make money with all the equipment in an oil well when you get only $ 4 a day.'' Compounding the economic troubles for <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s oil and gas operators is a new package of stringent environmental regulations passed in 1984. <PERSON> Rhoads </PERSON> calls them `` vindictive overkill.'' `` There's no way any individual operator can afford to comply with the current structure of the regulations,'' he says. `` It's not a problem of law It's a problem of the way the laws are administered, problems the bureaucrats have discretion over.'' `` We always survived the low price before. You just learn to run your operation to what your oil or gas check is,'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> says. `` But we did n't have all this environmental threat. They've got the penalties so far out of range and there's no way in God's world we could comply.'' <PERSON> Rhoads </PERSON> acknowledges that before the law was passed, the industry was mostly self-policing. Drilling permits were free and operators `` could do what they wanted.'' In fact, he says, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> was one of the last states to adopt environmental regulations for the energy industry. But the new law, he says, dealt with worst-case scenarios rather than everyday problems, to which were added excessive fees and burdensome paperwork. In one permit process, for instance, <PERSON> Stover </PERSON> spent more than $ 373 in postage to send 97 applications to the state because each had to be mailed individually. The new law includes a $ 2,500-per-well bond for fewer than 10 wells or $ 25,000 bond for 10 or more wells and a presumption-of-guilt clause that makes operators liable for drinking water contamination if the pollution occurs within 1,000 feet of their well. Abandoned wells must be plugged within a year, which <PERSON> Rhoads </PERSON> says can easily cost more than $ 5,000 per well. Rather than allowing operators to standardize the method of discharging brine, a common byproduct of oil drilling, the act requires separate plans for each discharge point, which can cost $ 6,000 to $ 50,000 per permit, <PERSON> Rhoads </PERSON> says. Many small independents say they would rather sell than deal with such regulations. Even that may not be feasible under current prices. It's `` impossible to sell or even give away property with inactive wells. I know because I tried,'' says <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Cline </PERSON>, 63, from <LOCATION> Bradford </LOCATION>, who owns several hundred wells near the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> border. `` Any buyer would have to bond the wells ... and be approved by the state. He would have to put aside money for plugging.'' `` We ca n't hang it up,'' says <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, whose father carried him into the oil fields when he was a boy. `` We've either got to plug these wells or bond them and get legal. If I ca n't afford to produce, how am I going to afford to plug?'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ifft </PERSON>, oil and gas program manager for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>, says producers' woes are more related to price than regulations. <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s laws, he says, are no more stringent than those of other states. `` All you have to do is read the newspapers and find out the same problems exist in the western states,'' says <PERSON> Ifft </PERSON>, who used to be an independent producer. Not surprisingly, environmentalists do n't see eye to eye with the producers. Oil and gas people `` create this false issue of environmental regulations,'' says <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, a statewide consumer group with 100,000 members. `` To look at them in one period of time is to really misconstrue the business. They're in a boom and bust business, and they know it full well ... These are big operators. They may look small, but they can still make fantastic sums.'' `` He's watched too much TV,'' counters <PERSON> Rhoads </PERSON>. The typical small operator is `` a working man who has a family to support and is living in the woods and enjoys it. He's a mom-and-pop business.'' Despite their complaints, most small operators will stick it out, <PERSON> Rhoads </PERSON> says. `` Out here in this country, you're talking a marginal lifestyle for many people. There are n't a whole lot of employment opportunities, so you deal in what you know ... What these people know is oil and gas because they were born with it.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ <LOCATION> Irving </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s best-known but most private songwriter, turns 100 this week. A diverse group of entertainers will take part in a tribute to <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION>, but do n't expect him to attend. Except for occasional strolls, <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> stays home, talking infrequently with his friends by telephone.

 Shortly before midnight on May 10, a small group of carolers will gather in front of a five-story brick mansion facing the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s posh Beekman Place. When the clock strikes 12, this impromptu glee club, led by composer and cabaret performer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallowitch </PERSON>, will break into `` Happy Birthday,'' followed by a chorus of `` Always.'' They will be celebrating at the doorstep of the man who wrote that haunting love song. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> Berlin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s best-known _ yet most private _ songwriter turns 100 on May 11, 1988. Just mention the melodies <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> wrote, and you'll start to sing: `` White Christmas,'' `` Easter Parade,'' `` God Bless <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' `` There's No Business Like Show Business,'' `` <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>'s Ragtime Band,'' `` A Pretty Girl Is Like a Melody,'' `` Puttin' on the Ritz,'' `` Blue Skies,'' `` How Deep is the Ocean?,'' `` Cheek to Cheek,'' to name a few. <PERSON> Wallowitch </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> salute, an annual celebration he began more than 20 years ago and which he usually holds at 6 p.m. on Christmas Eve, may be the most personal tribute to <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> this year. `` They have been devastatingly emotional experiences,'' says <PERSON> Wallowitch </PERSON>, an unabashed <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> fan who lives down the street and around the corner from the composer. But the only festivity officially recognized by the songwriter will be a Carnegie Hall salute on May 11 held in connection with <ORGANIZATION> ASCAP </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Composers </ORGANIZATION>, Authors and Publishers. <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> is a charter member of the organization _ founded in 1914 _ that licenses music for public performance. The collection of diverse performers expected to appear at the gala includes <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON>, <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronkite </PERSON>, <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> and <PERSON> Garrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Keillor </PERSON>. It will be taped by <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> for a television special later in the month. Do n't expect an appearance by the master. <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> is passionate about his privacy. Except for short walks around <LOCATION> Beekman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Place </LOCATION> when the weather is warm, <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> never is seen in public. On his infrequent strolls through the tranquil, tree-lined neighborhood, he usually is accompanied by a young woman or a doorman from a nearby building. Call the <LOCATION> Irving </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and ask for an interview with the boss. You'll get <PERSON> Hilda </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s longtime secretary. She is polite and friendly but adamant in declining interviews for her employer. `` I'm sorry I ca n't be more encouraging,'' the woman says. `` If we do one, we'd have to do them all. It's all in the record. You can look it up.'' And the record is pretty impressive: Some 1,500 songs that span the worlds of theater, movies and popular music. No other composer can match that record. For the stage, <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> wrote `` Annie Get Your Gun'' and more than a dozen other Broadway shows. His movies include several <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Astaire-Ginger </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> classics such as `` Top Hat'' and `` Follow the Fleet.'' His pop hits, those songs not written for any particular stage show or film, include such standards as `` Remember'' and `` All Alone.'' What makes his music so great? `` His songs have the sophistication of simplicity,'' says <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> ASCAP </ORGANIZATION>. `` You know precisely what he's saying and singing. He's been able to distill everything down to its essence. `` He also expresses universal truths,'' <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> adds. `` If you look at his song titles and listen to his music, he expresses emotions that human beings would like to experience. Most people want blue skies. They want the equivalent of white Christmases or the whole idea of what ` Easter Parade' evokes. And most of us do n't want to be all alone by the telephone He says it directly and you feel it.'' Ironically, the telephone is how <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> communicates with the outside world today. When he wants to talk, he calls. The songwriter has a small circle of telephone friends, people he dials when he has something on his mind. <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> is one such listener. `` He will just call,'' <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> says. `` His liaison will say ` Mr. <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> would like to talk to you.' When that happens, you drop everything and pick up the phone. It's a wonderful thing. He has a keen mind, and he's right on top of everything.''

 Another member of this select telephone circle is <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, a musical comedy historian and author of several books about the Broadway musical. Green last spoke to <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> when <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Astaire </PERSON> died last year. <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> called <PERSON> Green </PERSON> to express his regret about the passing of a man he admired very much. Most of <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s contemporaries are dead. He's the last of the great musical comedy composers, a pantheon that once included <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gershwin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Kern </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON>. Of his theater contemporaries, only director <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON>, who turns 101 in June, survives. <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, born <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baline </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>, came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at the age of 2. His family settled on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Lower </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> where, as a young boy, <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> got jobs singing on the Bowery. He worked as song plugger and a singing waiter at a <LOCATION> Chinatown </LOCATION> cafe. It was there that he learned to play the piano, laboriously picking out tunes with one finger. This self-taught musician writes the same way. ` It's an incredible catalog this man has achieved with no formal education as well as no musical education,'' <PERSON> Green </PERSON> says. `` And to be able to write music AND lyrics.'' For all his success, <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> is a loner, a man very much aware of his humble origins. His first wife, <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON>, died from typhoid fever less than a year after they were married. In 1926, <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> married his second wife, <PERSON> Ellin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mackay </PERSON>, the daughter of a wealthy and socially prominent businessman, <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Mackay </PERSON>, the president of a commercial telegraph company. She eloped with <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> over her <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> father's objections and the marriage was front-page news all over the country. In the more than 60 years they have been married, <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> has kept his wife and his three daughters out of the public eye. `` I think a reason he is so very private is that he is wildly in love with his wife,'' <PERSON> Wallowitch </PERSON> says. `` I think it is one of the greatest romantic love affairs in history.'' <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> is the only major songwriter who never had a film biography like <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>'s `` Night and Day,'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gershwin </PERSON>'s `` Rhapsody in Blue,'' <PERSON> Sigmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Romberg </PERSON>'s `` Deep in My Heart'' or <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>'s `` Words and Music. Coupled with his desire for privacy was <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s shrewd business instincts. In the early 1920s, he and two partners built the Music Box Theater to showcase his musical revues. He and the <ORGANIZATION> Shubert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> still own it. His music publishing company tightly controls his songs. <ORGANIZATION> ASCAP </ORGANIZATION> wo n't reveal the amount of money these melodies have generated, but the man is believed to be a millionaire many times over. <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> gave the royalties from `` God Bless America'' to the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. So far, they have earned some $ 700,000 from that one song. <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> withdrew even more from the public eye in 1962 after his last Broadway musical, `` Mr. President,'' flopped. The show, starring <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nanette </PERSON> <PERSON> Fabray </PERSON>, was a wildly anticipated musical, generating a record box-office advance but tepid reviews. It had a six-month run. Still he came back. Four years later, he wrote a new song, `` An Old - Fashioned Wedding'' for the <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> revival of `` Annie Get Your Gun'' which starred <PERSON> Ethel </PERSON> <PERSON> Merman </PERSON> Twenty years after the original production, she stopped the show again with <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s new song. In all his years of serenading <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Wallowitch </PERSON> finally was invited into the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> home nearly five Christmas Eves ago after a chorus of `` White Christmas.'' On an impulse, he rang the doorbell. A maid answered the door and he and his fellow singers were taken into the kitchen. There they were greeted by <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> himself, wearing a bathrobe and slippers. The composer hugged the men, kissed the women and told them, `` That's the nicest Christmas present I've ever had.'' Every day, <PERSON> Wallowitch </PERSON> walks his dog Winnie around Beekman Place and often wonders what is going on inside the big house now. `` I keep holding on to the idea that the man is not allowing himself to be bored and is still writing,'' <PERSON> Wallowitch </PERSON> says. `` God, I hope it's true.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ To hear some of them tell it, there are more witches in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> than you can shake a broom at.

 He's a <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran who spends quiet evenings watching <PERSON> Cary </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> movies and would like to be reincarnated as <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Astaire </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> is also <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s most visible witch, a second-degree high priest of Wicca, the religion of witchcraft. `` I do n't melt if water is poured over me,'' says the 40-year-old clerical worker who is campaigning for legal acceptance of his beliefs in both a male and female divinity, the potency of magic and absence of original sin. <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> began the quest last year when he asked his boss for paid religious leave on the Wiccan holidays of `` <LOCATION> Samhain </LOCATION>,'' Nov. 1, when witches celebrate the mortality of the body and immortality of the soul, and `` Belthane,'' May 1, welcoming summer, life and fertility. <ORGANIZATION> Humber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Applied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, which employs <ORGANIZATION> Arnold </ORGANIZATION> in its hospitality office, denied his request because Wicca is not recognized by the <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION> and lacks tax-free charitable status. <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> protested to a labor arbitration board which upheld his grievance and said: `` Wicca is obviously a religion ... the modern survival of the ancient pagan religions of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' But <ORGANIZATION> Arnold </ORGANIZATION>'s victory was short-lived. The native of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, who served a year in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, became an anti-war activist and emigrated to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> 15 years ago, had also applied for a license to become the first Canadian witch authorized to perform weddings. In a March ruling, the <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> registrar-general's office turned him down. It questioned the legitimacy of his ordination and the nature of the Wiccan marriage ritual, known as a `` handfasting.'' <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> blamed <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> establishment, although Council of Churches official <PERSON> Edith </PERSON> <PERSON> Shore </PERSON> showed some sympathy for the Wiccans. `` Christianity was a fringe group when it started, too,'' she said.

 <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> complained that the Marriage Act discriminates against <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s 5,000 witches by making it a crime, punishable by up to six months in jail, to perform an unauthorized wedding. `` They should either license me or do away with the law altogether,'' he said, noting that Wiccan weddings are permitted in 38 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> states. He had to travel to <LOCATION> Montpelier </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt. </LOCATION>, for his own Wiccan wedding three years ago. The practice of witchcraft is fairly widespread in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but precise numbers are hard to come by. `` It's everywhere, every big city probably has a group,'' says the Rev. <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Burtner </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> priest based in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, who studies cults. `` I see it basically as a nature religion not associated with Satanism, but that may be skewed because of whom I get to meet as a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> priest. It's a write-your-own theology sort of a approach and it runs a real broad spectrum.'' <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabrina </PERSON>, a high priestess in <LOCATION> Nashua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, estimates there are `` a couple of hundred thousand'' members scattered across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, including `` a couple of thousand'' high priests and priestesses. <PERSON> Starhawk </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> high priestess and author of `` The Spiral Dance,'' a book about Wicca, largely agrees. `` I just had a conversation with someone and we decided that there were between 250,000 and 4 million of us,'' she says. The 4 million, she explains, would include all pagans. `` In any case,'' she says, `` there are more of us than there are Unitarians.'' <PERSON> Starhawk </PERSON> says many members are underground. `` There is a long tradition where it is not safe to be a witch,'' she says. `` We do n't necessarily announce it. Many people's jobs would be in jeopardy.'' <PERSON> Starhawk </PERSON>, an author and lecturer, teaches at a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> college in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. Her most recent book is `` Truth or Dare Encounters with <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> and Mystery.'' <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabrina </PERSON> runs Our Lady of Enchantment, a Wicca mail order school with 6,000 members representing 25 countries.

 `` I have performed marriages and have tax-exempt status, but I only know 12 or 15 others who have tax exempt-status,'' she says. `` You really have to fight to get it.'' `` Many of us in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> perform marriages, but here if you go through the trouble to sign the papers and take a blood test, you can get licensed to perform marriages,'' <PERSON> Starhawk </PERSON> says. `` A dog could get the license here.'' <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabrina </PERSON>, whose church is open to the public on Friday nights, says she never heard of <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON>, but that does not surprise her. `` For a while a woman in <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, who was picketing the movie ` Witches of Eastwick' became very well known. Since there is no central organization, whoever makes the most noise becomes the most prominent witch.'' <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON>, a soft-spokeman man with a beard, says he was initiated as a priest in witchcraft traditions dating back thousands of years. Each coven, grove or temple chooses its own rituals and vows. Some covens meet in the nude, but <ORGANIZATION> Arnold </ORGANIZATION>'s group prefers robes. He offered this description of a Wiccan wedding: Inside a magical circle, the male and female divinities are summoned along with the guardians of the four elements _ air, water, fire and earth. The groom's left hand is bound to the bride's right hand and some choose to draw blood from their skin and touch like blood brothers. Couples exchange rings, bracelets or floral crowns; step over flames for purification and fertility, and jump over a broom to symbolize household unity. Traditional gifts include bread -LRB- for plenty -RRB-, silver -LRB- prosperity -RRB-, salt -LRB- health -RRB- and wood or coal -LRB- physical and emotional warmth -RRB-. Before the priest pronounces them husband and wife, he invokes the couple `` to pleasure one another,'' <ORGANIZATION> Arnold </ORGANIZATION> says. `` We do n't cut sex off from the rest of life. We do n't make a big thing out of it either.'' At the heart of the primitive religion lies the power of the male and female in nature, symbolized by the god usually referred to by the Celtic name <PERSON> Herne </PERSON>, and the goddess known as Cerridwen or <ORGANIZATION> Athena </ORGANIZATION> or Isis, <ORGANIZATION> Arnold </ORGANIZATION> said. Wiccans also believe in the mysteries of magic, reincarnation and in celebrating the rites of passage, such as first menstruation and menopause. `` We go through life after life to learn and evolve and progress to the point where we rejoin the god and goddess,'' <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> says. `` Behind them, there is something we ca n't even identify, the unity they come from.'' Witches do n't go around laying curses on people, and they do n't conduct human or animal sacrifices, eat babies or worship the devil as depicted in folklore and comics, he said But the craft does have a practical side. `` I mix up potions and my wife makes some of the finest liqueurs you've ever tasted,'' <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> says. `` I use wormwood and calendula -LRB- a rare herb -RRB- in vinegar to take bruises away and lavender vinegar for sunburn.'' <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> says he discovered his religion 10 years ago after intuitively constructing a Wiccan altar in his home. A woman he was dating happened to be a witch and was startled to see the altar. Leader of the 50-member Temple of the Elder Faiths in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Arnold </ORGANIZATION> was raised in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> by a grandmother who read tea leaves. `` We believe that if you are meant to find the craft, you will,'' he says. `` Many traditional Wiccans think we're growing too fast and this will water down the religion and may actually destroy it.'' He said covens usually meet on eight sabbaths coinciding with the year's solar and lunar cycles. The average age in his group is 27 and members include a real estate agent, a schoolteacher and a naturopath. `` Covens are closer than most families. Members tend to be more imaginative than most people and a little bit eccentric,'' said <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON>, a published poet and expert on ritual body decoration.

 They're just four street cops and a real estate agent until they take their guitars, keyboard and drums before a high school audience. Then they become `` Hot Pursuit,'' a rock' n' roll band with a message: Stay away from drugs. In just over a year they've taken that message to high school auditoriums and gymnasiums from here to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. They've cut a record album, appeared on national television, performed at a White House anti-drug conference, and have been invited to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The band leans heavily on music from the early days of rock' n' roll The 1955 hit `` Jail House Rock'' is their theme song and they quickly follow with such numbers as `` Mony Mony'' from 1968, `` Twist and Shout,'' and `` Wipe Out.'' The five musicians get their kicks watching their young audiences. `` They dance in the aisles and they come on stage to sing with us,'' says <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> patrolman <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Ankrom </PERSON>, the drummer. Lt. <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Tresselt </PERSON>, who doubles as promoter and manager of the band, says, `` When you hear the enthusiasm of the kids and how they get into the music, it's all worthwhile.'' Patrolman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillilan </PERSON>, bass guitarist and vocalist, says, `` One thing we want to do is show them that cops are people who have a job to do and then they go home to their families and bowling leagues like other people.'' At first it was just a pickup band organized by <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> patrolmen. Then about a year ago one dropped out and they brought in <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Finks </PERSON>, a real estate agent with a radio-TV background who works the keyboard and is a backup vocalist. Other members of the band are vocalist <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> and lead guitarist <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> is the sound engineer. `` We started as a weekend fun way to get away from the stress of street duty,'' <PERSON> Tresselt </PERSON> says. `` We just played private parties at first.'' Then Police Chief <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> happened to hear the band play one night. `` He said he wanted to see all of us in his office the first thing Monday and we thought we were in trouble,'' <PERSON> Tresselt </PERSON> says. `` Then he told us the department could use us to go into schools with the anti-drug message.'' From that, the band's reputation has grown. It played at a regional drug conference in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> last fall and then got an invitation to perform at the White House Conference for a Drug-Free <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in February. En route home they played at three schools in <LOCATION> Scotch </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plaines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, a suburb of <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>. They plan a four-county swing to schools in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> in May and have been invited back to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. They also have invitations to play at a July 4 party for the <ORGANIZATION> U. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and at a national Boy Scout conference in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> on July 16. `` We've got the hotel reservations and are trying to get someone to underwrite the plane tickets,'' <PERSON> Tresselt </PERSON> says. The band has played a regular schedule of area schools twice a week since last Nov. 1. This year, they began making one-day swings to other parts of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gillilan </PERSON> says a <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> entertainment group has approached them about making a two-hour pilot movie for television. `` Just on the sale of the album alone we've raised $ 12,000 for the Children's <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guidance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> and Alcohol Program,'' <PERSON> Gillilan </PERSON> says. Stacks of mail on <PERSON> Tresselt </PERSON>'s desk testify to the reaction from students across the state. `` After one performance a kid wrote us that he had never thought about policemen having families,'' says <PERSON> Ankrom </PERSON>, percussionist for the band. `` He thought we just stayed in uniform and rode in patrol cars 24 hours a day.'' The band has no budget to speak of, and money is a major problem. They still play for private parties on weekends but most of the money earned goes to pay for equipment that <PERSON> Tresselt </PERSON> says is mostly owned by a bank. A department store underwrote the trips to <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. A local automobile dealer has leased the city a band equipment truck for $ 1 a year, and the city rented some equipment, such as strobe lights and smoke machines that allow them to play in larger auditoriums. `` We've got all kinds of ideas for the band and no money,'' <PERSON> Gillilan </PERSON> says. `` But we've found that the kids are remembering us,'' he added. `` Two of our guys caught a kid stealing cars on the south end of town and all the way to the central station all he talked about was ` Hot Pursuit,' and the fact he was n't on drugs.'' And, says <PERSON> Tresselt </PERSON>, `` The band keeps us off the street.''

 EDITOR's NOTE _ There are many residential child-care facilities across the country, but only a few like <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Excelsior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION>, a haven for troubled young girls. For many of them, the school represents one last chance before they are locked up or placed in a hospital.

 <PERSON> Liz </PERSON>, a 17-year-old with a string of drug arrests, lit a cigarette and summed up her 10 months in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> with the bored look of a graduating senior. `` I grew up,'' she said. She had not wanted to come to <ORGANIZATION> Excelsior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION>, and was more than ready to go home. But she said the school finally helped her escape the revolving door of juvenile courts and group homes she had been stuck in for years in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. Excelsior, a place for troubled girls perched on the high plains southeast of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, consists of a junior and senior high school and Residential Child Care Facility. Excelsior is one of a few such schools for girls in the country and draws students from 17 states. For many girls, the school represents one last chance before they are locked up or placed in a hospital. `` You have to put up with the girls, with their smart mouths and their attitudes and their moods,'' says <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> -LRB- not her real name -RRB-. `` But you get the support of the girls too, and of the staff and the therapist.'' She came to Excelsior on the recommendation of a caseworker in <LOCATION> Gary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, after five previous placements had failed to improve her behavior. `` At first I was just really upset because I was getting sent away from my family,'' she says. Then she started working at a nearby clothing store, saving money, making friends and continuing to work with a therapist. Things got better. `` They make you deal with your issues _ you just have to be willing to deal with your issues,'' she says. The `` issues'' for <ORGANIZATION> Excelsior </ORGANIZATION>'s 130 girls, ages 12 to 18, range from incest and abuse to murder, prostitution and, often, depression. There's 13-year-old <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON>, found by social service workers in a run-down shack in rural <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, unable to speak after years of sexual and emotional abuse. When she arrived at <LOCATION> Excelsior </LOCATION>, she would hoard pieces of metal in her clothes and try to kill herself with them, school officials said. There's <PERSON> Laura </PERSON>, who will stay at Excelsior until she recovers from the shock of losing two family members to violent deaths, and <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON>, who arrived after frequent encounters with the juvenile system in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> for prostitution and drug abuse. One of the school's better-known graduates is <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Jahnke </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> teen-ager who was convicted with her younger brother, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>, in the November 1982 shooting death of their abusive father. <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Jahnke </PERSON>'s prison sentence was commuted and she spent 1 -LCB- years at <LOCATION> Excelsior </LOCATION> undergoing psychiatric evaluation and awaiting court rulings. `` These are students they ca n't educate in the public school system ... kids with severe emotional and behavioral problems who would otherwise probably be in a psychiatric hospital,'' says Excelsior Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON>, known to the girls as `` Mr. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON>.'' When <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> walks through the halls during a typical school day, he is greeted with hellos and hugs. In one room a class is making sushi and Mr. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> is invited to test it. In another room, a chorus of girls is preparing for a concert. They ask him if he'll come to see it. The cottages where the girls live look out on the <LOCATION> Rockies </LOCATION>. They resemble college dormitories more than a reform school. The girls' rooms are plastered with posters of animals, rock stars, the <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broncos </ORGANIZATION> and inspirational quotations <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> says he can tell how well a girl has adjusted by how much she has plastered on her wall.

 <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Excelsior </LOCATION> girls have had an average of eight previous placements in institutions such as psychiatric hospitals, halfway houses and foster and group homes. The majority come out of locked institutions. Most referrals to Excelsior come from county social workers and school districts. A few wealthier students are placed privately by their parents. The average stay at the school is 13 months, and there's a long waiting list. Excelsior, a private association run by an 11-member board, is funded mainly by counties, which pay a fee for each child placed at the school. The fee for both treatment and school comes to about $ 2,700 per month per student, which <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> says is cheaper than psychiatric hospitalization. `` In effect what we're doing is taking kids who've been in the system for a long time. We're putting kids out of the system.'' While residential child-care facilities are numerous, there are only about 15 girls' schools in the country that offer the broad program Excelsior does, <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> says. Excelsior began its operation here in 1973 and runs on an annual budget of $ 4.5 million, derived from the fees paid by counties and from contributions. Because the state has imposed a three-year freeze on county payments for child-care facilities, <LOCATION> Excelsior </LOCATION> has been seeking more out-of-state students. It needs more help from the state, <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> says, with the number of disturbed adolescents and teen suicides rising. Meantime, fund raising and a bond issue is to finance a new $ 700,000 building that will include a 12-bed treatment unit. Originally isolated, the 33-acre campus now is surrounded by homes and shopping centers. Neighbors have never complained about the school, <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> says. An accredited junior and senior high school, <PERSON> Excelsior </PERSON> offers a licensed school of cosmetology and fields basketball, volleyball and softball teams calling themselves the `` Eagles.'' It also has a Treatment and Learning Center that can handle severely disturbed students. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> says there are three or four `` incidents'' a month. There have been no suicides, `` but we've come close. The school's 170 employees include therapists, medical personnel, teachers and counselors who live with groups of students in cottages. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> calls the treatment `` re-parenting.'' `` A lot of these kids missed good parenting in their important, developmental needs,'' he says. `` We do n't focus exclusively on the psyche. We take care of the total child _ training in hygiene, social skills. `` We as adults are in charge and these types of kids need good healthy authority. It's not a punitive authority but a strong, nurturing, parenting kind of authority.'' Excelsior also emphasizes family therapy, sometimes flying child and therapist to the parents' home in an effort to get the girl back into her family. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> says about 85 percent of the girls who leave Excelsior have completed treatment and are able to function independently. <PERSON> Liz </PERSON>'s treatment coordinator, <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodnick </PERSON>, says she was seriously disturbed and self-destructive when she came to <LOCATION> Excelsior </LOCATION>, but the school could reach her by offering `` an incentive to work.'' `` They realize the benefits come from taking responsibility,'' he says. `` Yes, a lot of terrible things have happened in your life _ parental breakups, sexual abuse _ but the bottom line is you're responsible for your life now `` A <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> decides the payoff is in working, not in denying.''

 It's been more than 20 years since <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON> has starred in a regular television series, but he says he's about to make a comeback. Not that <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON> has been a stranger to the tube. He has been bouncing around the world the past few years filming miniseries. In his latest, he co-stars with <PERSON> Jacyln </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> in `` The Bourne Identity,'' based on <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ludlum </PERSON>'s spy thriller, which <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> will televise in two parts on Sunday and Monday. <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON> is now developing a regular series, his first since he quit `` Dr. <PERSON> Kildare </PERSON>'' in 1966 and took off to <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> to shed his boyish image and become a serious actor. `` We've hit on a wonderful idea, which I ca n't talk about,'' he says. `` We took the idea to <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> and got a deal for 13 shows.'' <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON> is quite ready to relinquish his title as the `` king of the miniseries'' and have work that will keep him off the road. `` I'm tired of this gypsy life,'' says <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON>, just back from four months in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> filming the <PERSON> Ludlum </PERSON> story. `` I had n't anticipated doing another series. But I wanted to find a way to settle down. When you do a series you're at the studio all the time, but you do get to go home at night.'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, the former `` Charlie's Angel'' who's known as the `` queen of the miniseries,'' also does n't want to travel as much now that her children are approaching school age. She's looking for a comedy series. About his role in `` The Bourne Identity,'' <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON> says: `` <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourne </PERSON> is a fascinating character, very complex, very divided. He's basically a scholar and teacher, but he has become this terribly efficient undercover agent. The story begins when he has been shot in the head and washes up on shore in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> with amnesia. `` All he knows is that he has a <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> bank account with $ 15 million and everyone is trying to kill him. Evidence begins to build that he is the notorious terrorist <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON>. He takes <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> hostage. Then they fall in love. She ends up saving him.'' The story, like all of those by <PERSON> Ludlum </PERSON>, is terribly complicated, but it has been simplified by screenwriter <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Sobieski </PERSON>. It was directed on location by <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. `` There's a lot of mystery about the character,'' <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON> says. `` Not only for the audience but for him as well. <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> has taken the story and kept it clear and simple.'' Filming started last year in <LOCATION> Nice </LOCATION>, on the <LOCATION> Riviera </LOCATION>, then after a Christmas break moved to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and back to <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>. `` We were terrified before starting that <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION> would be 30 below zero,'' <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON> says. `` But we had an incredible break in the weather. It was a very warm winter. <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> was more stunningly beautiful than ever. `` We had a lot of phone booth scenes, because it figures in the plot. We carried our own phone booth with us. We set it up in Place Vendome, which is sacred to the French. People driving by could n't believe it `` This is a very physical role. We had a lot of fights and car chases. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION> I rescue <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Jaclyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> -RRB- from a fate worse than death and get beat up in the process. We filmed six nights in a row in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>. We had so many scenes with a streetcar that we rented our own.'' Before going to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON> spent six months in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> doing `` Blithe Spirit'' on <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION>. Most of his projects have kept him away from home. He was in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for six months for `` Shogun,'' in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> three months for `` <LOCATION> Wallenberg </LOCATION>,'' and in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> for eight months for `` King <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>'s Mines. Other projects also took him many places. For `` Centennial,'' to <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>; for `` Three Musketeers,'' to <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>; for `` <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> and <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>,'' to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, and for `` Dream West,'' to <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. `` The Thorn Birds'' was the only miniseries filmed here. He's also developing a new theatrical movie based on the novel `` Say Goodbye to <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>.''

 <PERSON> Earle </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyman </PERSON>, best known for his TV role as <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON>'s father, says the only place where he is truly recognized as a star is in <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, a country he loves. But <PERSON> Hyman </PERSON> is pleased with the reception he's getting on Broadway where he recently took over the role of the chauffeur in the Pulitzer Prize-winning play `` Driving Miss Daisy.'' And he says that playing the part of the chauffeur, <PERSON> Hoke </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, is one of his favorite roles in his 45 years as an actor. `` I'm not leaving unless they fire me,'' says <PERSON> Hyman </PERSON>, 61. `` It's a play that shows pure love coming from the strangest place It is the mystery of the human heart.'' The play, written by <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Uhry </PERSON> and set in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> in the years from 1948 to 1973, opened in April 1987. <PERSON> Hyman </PERSON> followed the original <PERSON> Hoke </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleburn </PERSON>, <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, in February. <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Sternhagen </PERSON> had taken over the role of Miss Daisy from <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivey </PERSON> in January. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Gill </PERSON>, the only other member of the cast, continues to play Miss Daisy's son. `` Frances and I get entrance applause once or twice a week,'' <PERSON> Hyman </PERSON> says. `` It's heartwarming. I come from a time in the theater when there were stars and we always applauded when they made their entrances.'' Only 287 people a night can be seated in the <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON> Theater to watch <PERSON> Hyman </PERSON> play <PERSON> Hoke </PERSON> but he's seen by millions in his TV appearances on `` The Cosby Show.'' His earnings from television enabled <PERSON> Hyman </PERSON> to buy a house in <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> where he frequently appears on the stage. `` The only place I'm a star in the true sense of the word is <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>,'' he says. `` There they come to see me and hope the play is all right. I'm the only foreign actor and only black actor who peforms in both Norwegian languages.'' <PERSON> Hyman </PERSON> says that the first time he took a vacation, during his five years at the American <ORGANIZATION> Shakespeare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Stratford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, he visited <LOCATION> Scandinavia </LOCATION>. He wound up staying the entire three weeks in <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, the home of his longtime lady friend. `` The first time I stepped on that soil I fell in love with it,'' he says. `` I felt I'd been there before.'' In <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hyman </PERSON> met the grandson of <PERSON> Henrik </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibsen </PERSON>, the famous dramatist, who introduced him to theater people. <PERSON> Hyman </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> His parents, both schoolteachers, moved to <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> so their four children could be educated in the North. `` I was the only black boy in the school,'' he recalls. `` The pressure was awful; I had nowhere to hide. I'm glad I managed to be the best. I had a photographic memory. I'd read things twice and I knew it.'' <PERSON> Hyman </PERSON>'s father became assistant to the city parks commissioner and designed the landscaping in Prospect Park and at the Planetarium. `` It's very moving today for me to go look at those trees,'' <PERSON> Hyman </PERSON> says. `` Then the Depression came along and he was fired. He thought it was because he was black. I'm sure he was right. It hurt him. He became bitter about it, which is worse than being hurt, and he kind of gave up. `` Down times came and we moved to poorer and poorer houses and apartments. It pushed me straight into theater.'' On his 13th birthday, <PERSON> Hyman </PERSON> took his girlfriend to see his first professional play, <PERSON> Ibsen </PERSON>'s `` Ghosts.'' `` I rushed to the library the next day and read all of <PERSON> Ibsen </PERSON>'s plays,'' he says `` My interest in <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> started there. I went to the theater every week. Twenty-five cents it cost to sit in the second balcony.'' He attached himself to <PERSON> Mercedes </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, who played in `` The Green Pastures.'' `` I haunted her house,'' <PERSON> Hyman </PERSON> says. `` She sort of adopted me, gave me pointers. There were no jobs for black actors.'' Then a radio producer called the actress one day while <PERSON> Hyman </PERSON> was there. He needed someone to play <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> <PERSON> Carver </PERSON> as a boy. <PERSON> Black </PERSON> told <PERSON> Hyman </PERSON>, then 16, to speak, pitching his voice high to sound like he was 7. He got the job, but the producer was startled when in walked a 6-foot-4 teen-ager. <PERSON> Hyman </PERSON> added an `` e'' to his first name, <PERSON> Earl </PERSON>, and in 1943 was offered a walk-on part in `` Run, Little Chillun!'' on Broadway. It lasted two weeks but led to his appearance in the American Negro Theater's `` Three's a Family.'' <PERSON> Hyman </PERSON> decided to stay in show business after appearing in the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Negro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theater </ORGANIZATION>'s `` <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucasta </PERSON>.'' `` This time we came down to Broadway to stay and stay,'' he says. `` Driving Miss Daisy'' will be made into a movie, but <PERSON> Hyman </PERSON> does n't think he'll get the role because he has n't done many feature films. `` I really wish I'd done more movies,'' he says. `` Dore Schary offered me a featured role in ` Something of Value,' starring <PERSON> Rock </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Poitier </PERSON>. I turned it down. I felt I could n't do it well ... Sometimes in this business it is n't too good to be too honest with yourself. `` I turned down a few other roles in movies because I love the theater so much. What snobs we theater actors can be.''

 <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> is an Academy Award-winning makeup man, but not many stars would ask him for a touch-up before facing the camera. Well, maybe <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Karloff </PERSON> or <PERSON> Bela </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugosi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lon </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaney </PERSON> would have been delighted. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s specialty is creating movie monsters. He won the first annual Oscar award for special makeup effects in 1981 for `` An <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> Werewolf in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>.'' Last month, he won a second Academy Award for his makeup work in `` <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Hendersons </ORGANIZATION>.'' His work can be seen every Friday on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` Beauty & amp; the <LOCATION> Beast </LOCATION>,'' for which he created the face of the kindly Beast, <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON>. One of his most malevolent creatures stars in the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> miniseries `` Something Is Out There,'' airing Sunday and Monday. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> created the `` something,'' a grotesque alien that comes to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and begins a series of grisly murders. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Cortese </PERSON> stars as a detective investigating the strange deaths. <PERSON> Maryam </PERSON> D'Abo co-stars as a mysterious woman he learns is from another planet and is pursuing the creature. `` I started with a sketch, which I showed to the producer,'' said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, in an interview at his <LOCATION> Glendale </LOCATION> studio. `` Once we all agreed, I did a clay mockup.'' Two assistants hauled out the mockup, which was about 4 feet long and looked like a mutant scorpion. It also has some spider features and its back is covered with huge spikes, like a dinosaur. `` It's a space bug,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> explained, `` and we call it <PERSON> Spike </PERSON> because it has so many spikes. It's able to change appearance and take over the body of its victims. We constructed a tail section that's 12 feet long. The creature we built for the movie is much nastier looking than this. It has a number of finger-like feelers on its face, which makes it look like someone stuck a big spider on his face.'' With looks like that, imagine <PERSON> Spike </PERSON>'s personality. `` It has a terrible personality, if you can call it that,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` ` It's really just a killing machine that's trying to survive.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said it's much more graphic than what's usually allowed on television. `` I do n't know how much they'll allow on the air,'' he said. `` It was difficult to do and keep it acceptable.'' At an age when most kids were playing cops and robbers or cowboys and Indians, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> was creating monsters. `` I already knew what I wanted to do with my life when I was 10,'' he said. `` I was fascinated by <PERSON> Frankenstein </PERSON>. I wanted to know who made it. My father was an artist and he taught me a few basic things. I bought books on sculpting and mold making. `` I lived in <LOCATION> Covina </LOCATION>, but I had no connection with the movie business. That made it very difficult to get started. I grew up working with grease paint, putty and making rubber masks. `` I was very shy and I found that when I made myself up I could things I would n't do otherwise. Also, I loved to fool people. The first time I did a gash on my arm, my mother thought I was really hurt. I did a lot of blood-and-gore stuff when I was a kid. I scared so many people I was n't allowed in a lot of houses.'' His first job, while still in high school, was making up stage actors. Then he went to work for a stop-motion animation studio making models for `` Gumby'' and `` <PERSON> Davy </PERSON> and Goliath.'' `` I did my first film my second year in college,'' he said. `` It was ` Octo-Man,' part octopus and part man. I made the costume for $ 500. I used almost all the money I got for the job to make it as good as possible. After that, I never really had to look for a job. People came to me.'' His first major job was making <PERSON> Cicely </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> look 100 years old in `` The Autobiography of Miss <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Pittman </PERSON>.'' He was only 20 and won an Emmy. For the remake of `` King <PERSON> Kong </PERSON>,'' he made the ape suits and even played the part of the big gorilla. `` They could n't find anyone else stupid enough to wear the suit,'' he said. He made most of the creatures in the cantina scene in `` Star Wars,'' including the grotesque band. His study of gorillas came in handy for `` Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes,'' for which he made all the ape costumes. `` I made 27 costumes,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` I had to have different heads, different hands. It took 10 months to do the suits with 90 people. We kept working right to the end of the picture. They wanted people to think those were real apes. They were n't.''

<TEXT>
 May 3, 1968. It began as any other Friday in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. People headed for work with no idea that by nightfall blood would be in the streets, that students would battle police in an insurrection destined to shake French society to its roots. `` Nineteen sixty-eight was a cultural revolution in every sense of the word. Afterward, nothing was the same,'' said <PERSON> Regis </PERSON> <PERSON> Debray </PERSON>, then a radical and today an adviser to President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>. The month-long series of strikes, protests and pitched battles nearly brought down the Fifth Republic of President <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaulle </PERSON>. He resigned the following year. Two decades later, historians call May 1968 the greatest popular uprising ever experienced by a capitalist democracy in time of peace. The Events of May, as they are called, still reverberate in French minds. Politics, schools, family life and work, art and popular culture were transformed. May 1968 was a knife blade that severed past from future, youth from authority, then from now. When the tear gas cleared, a new libertarian tolerance was in the wind and the twin political pillars of Gaullist nationalism and communism were permanently fractured. <PERSON> Debray </PERSON> said, `` It was a revolution in the way we live, a transition from an old, rural <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> where everyone had great respect for central authority toward a modern, urban <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> of more liberal individualists.'' The spasms of unrest in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> were part of a common impulse felt by a global generation, the affluent postwar children who, from <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, focused their anger in protest of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> involvement in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, the former French colony. Today, many of these angry young men are leaders of French society. The flashpoint of the Events of May was the suburban campus of <LOCATION> Nanterre </LOCATION>, where protests the preceding March led to the closing of the school. On May 3, about 500 students staged a sit-in at the Sorbonne, the old and respected university in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, to protest disciplinary action at <LOCATION> Nanterre </LOCATION>. By late afternoon masses of riot police had surrounded the Sorbonne and began making arrests. Students poured from Latin Quarter cafes with shouts of `` Liberez nos camarades'' -LRB- Free our comrades -RRB-. Fighting began. A frantic administration shut down the <LOCATION> Sorbonne </LOCATION>, for only the second time in 700 years. A week of shocking violence followed. Students erected barricades of buses, felled trees, benches and streets signs. They tore cobblestones from the streets and to hurl at police. Riot police clubbed students and chased them through narrow streets, sometimes blocking medical help to the injured. Stinging clouds of tear gas shrouded <ORGANIZATION> Left </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> neighborhoods. By mid-May the brutality had swung public opinion behind the students. Writer <PERSON> Mavis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallant </PERSON>, in her recently published diary, described the morning after a violent clash that injured 367 students. `` Ripped streets around the <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> Station. People who live around here seem dazed. ... Paving torn up. ... Where I used to live looks bombed. Burned cars, ugly, gray-black. ... Armed men and unarmed children. ... We all feel sick.'' <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravetz </PERSON>, a leading student figure on the barricades and now foreign editor of the newspaper Liberation, said the burning car is the single image of the street fighting that endures in French minds. `` The car was the symbol of middle-class achievement,'' he said. `` And bourgeois values were going up in smoke.'' More than a million people formed a river of flags and banners pouring down <ORGANIZATION> Left </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> boulevards May 13 and reports of demonstrations came from college towns across <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Then, something even more astonishing happened. In a spontaneous wave that swept the nation, more than 9 million people went on strike. Normal life in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> came to a halt. It was impossible to buy a newspaper, go to school, send a letter, cash a check, ride the bus or subway, watch television or take a train. Frightened people, who remembered World War II, began hoarding cigarettes, sugar and canned goods. The difference between the strikes at <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Sorbonne </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> was that the rest of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> barely noticed what was happening uptown at <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> was paralyzed. Garbage piled up in the streets. Teachers stopped teaching, actors stopped acting. The Odeon Theatre was occupied by students and workers holding marathon debates on creating a new society. Even rugby players went on strike.

<HEAD>PARIS: on strike.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The strikes marked the beginning of the end for the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which sabotaged the student movement, believing it an uncontrollable revolt of spoiled, middle-class kids. But that attitude permanently alienated intellectuals and youth and contributed to the eventual election of Socialist president, <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>. More significantly, French politics had to deal with a new force _ the media. Young people came to view television, radio and newspapers as not just reporters of events, but tools for the creation of events. <PERSON> Debray </PERSON> said one such creation was <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohn-Bendit </PERSON>, the best known of the radical student leaders called <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> the Red because of his rusty hair and provocative style. `` It was not <PERSON> Cohn-Bendit </PERSON> who organized the rallies or did the concrete work,'' <PERSON> Debray </PERSON> said. `` But he was the one the television cameras loved, so, whether he wanted to or not, he became a major leader of the movement. `` Nineteen sixty-eight was the beginning of the media's conquest of French politics and life.'' Young people realized that all they needed was not a place in the French Cabinet to be effective but two minutes on the evening news. `` We stopped thinking in terms of traditional politics,'' said historian <PERSON> Herve </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamon </PERSON>, once a student on the barricades and now author of a history of the 1968 generation. <PERSON> Hamon </PERSON> said as his peers grew older, they indeed rejected politics to pursue careers in medicine, teaching, the arts _ and, above all, journalism. <PERSON> Cohn-Bendit </PERSON>, born in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> of German parents, now publishes a current affairs magazine in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. At 43, he still lives the life of a free-lance radical, writing books and working with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s anti-establishment Greens party. `` I believe I can still legitimize everything I do from my standpoint in 1968,'' <PERSON> Cohn-Bendit </PERSON> said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, adding that events 20 years ago irrevocably changed morality, sexuality and French education. <PERSON> Alain </PERSON> <PERSON> Peyrefitte </PERSON>, who as <ORGANIZATION> De </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gaulle </ORGANIZATION>'s Education Minister in 1968 considered <PERSON> Cohn-Bendit </PERSON> a troublemaker, now agrees with his assessment of the events. `` I was against the movement and felt it was my duty to limit it at the time. But I recognize that in the long-term the effects were good,'' said <PERSON> Peyrefitte </PERSON>, now head of the editorial board for the conservative newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Figaro </ORGANIZATION>. `` People became more responsible for their lives, gained more dignity and felt more free.'' On May 30, <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaulle </PERSON> made a long-awaited radio speech, reassuring French citizens, who were fed up with upheaval, that the government was in control. Hours later, millions of Frenchmen jammed the Place de la Concorde, waving the French flag. The nation cooled down as abruptly as it caught fire. Under <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaulle </PERSON>, a series of reforms came in late 1968 to decrease the number of students in a classroom, increase personal contact between students and professors and decentralize the control of schools. Nineteen sixty-eight opened the door for the French feminist movement in the 1970s and the introduction of legal reforms governing abortion and contraception. Relationships between men and women changed. The students of the barricades now are graying parents and relationships between these fathers and sons are less formal, more tolerant. `` In the marches of'68 you never saw any parents,'' said <PERSON> Kravetz </PERSON>. `` In 1986, in the demonstrations against the education reforms, parents marched beside their kids. There is greater communication between the generations now. `` To understand what 1968 meant to us, you would have to have seen what we were like before.''

 `` <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is n't a land of immigration,'' government officials like to say. But a massive influx of Turks and other foreigners has changed the face of this once insular nation. From dozens of kebab stands in big cities to young Turkish children playing in rural towns, the foreigners are making their presence felt. Nearly 1.5 million Turks live in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the largest group among the 4.5 million foreigners in a country with a total population of 61.3 million. <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> has a Turkish bazaar. Yugoslavs number about 590,000 and Italians are the third-largest with about 535,000. One of the Turks is <PERSON> Nedzhati </PERSON> <PERSON> Baris </PERSON>, who has acquired a small but successful business and an expensive home in the affluent town of <LOCATION> Koenigstein </LOCATION>, outside <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. `` My position here now is quite good,'' he said in German at his store. `` We are well known, since we've been here a long time. `` The only worry is bringing my mother for a visit from <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. We've been waiting eight months for a visa.'' The immigrant workers began arriving in the 1960s and 1970s and were called <PERSON> Gastarbeiter </PERSON>, German for guest workers, to signify what was to have been a temporary stay. Now, most of the Turks are still work on assembly lines or at menial jobs shunned by West Germans. Journalist <PERSON> Guenther </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallraff </PERSON>'s 1985 book on the exploitation of Turkish workers, `` Ganz Unten'' -LRB- Rock Bottom -RRB-, became a best-seller and stirred controversy and soul-searching among West Germans. Federal and state authorities are trying to reduce the number of foreigners in the country and make it more difficult for them to bring in family members. But opposition groups say <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s economy, one of the world's strongest, will need even more foreign workers in the future as the German birth rate continues to drop. Although most Turks hold low-paid jobs, some of them are successful businessmen. Turkish-owned travel agencies specializing in trips to their homeland are mushrooming across the country, cashing in on the West Germans' growing interest in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. Turks, nevertheless, have been physically attacked by West German extremist groups, and they face other problems. `` According to all our studies, the Turks by far have the most difficult time integrating into the German society,'' said <PERSON> Hartmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Reichow </PERSON>, an expert in the federal office for foreigners in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>. `` This has to do with their background: They have a different religion -LRB- Islam -RRB- and come from a totally different culture,'' <PERSON> Reichow </PERSON> said in an interview. `` But the situation is much better now than it was in the late 1960s. Then, very few Turkish children went to school. Now, more and more and are getting even higher education and their prospects look much brighter.'' Two high schools in <LOCATION> Gelsenkirchen </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Ruhr </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> industrial city, recently became the first in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to offer the Turkish language as one of the subjects for the `` abitur,'' the examination that gives successful candidates a diploma roughly equal to a junior college degree in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The schools, whose student bodies are about a quarter Turkish or Turkish-born, were the first to apply a long-existing law allowing a foreign language to be one of the subjects in the final exam. Turks are also making their mark on cultural life. The Turkish-born director <PERSON> Tevfik </PERSON> <PERSON> Baser </PERSON> scored a hit two years ago with his movie `` 40 Square Meters <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>,'' a moving story about a the wife of a Turkish worker forced by her husband never to leave their tiny apartment in <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION>. The leading role was played by <PERSON> Ozay </PERSON> <PERSON> Fecht </PERSON>, who came to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Istanbul </LOCATION> when she was 18 and became a critically acclaimed actress and jazz singer. Another Turk, <PERSON> Saliha </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheinhardt </PERSON>, who married a West German, advanced from a textile factory worker, waitress and air hostess to prize-winning author, writing mostly in German. But it is the service sector where Turks and other foreigners are beginning to play dominant roles. They run neighborhood ethnic restaurants and groceries, as well as tailor and shoe-repair shops. `` <LOCATION> Istanbul </LOCATION> Kebab,'' `` Balkan Grill,'' and `` Italian Pizza'' are found not only in large cities but also in many villages across <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.

 In <LOCATION> Koenigstein </LOCATION>, a half-hour's drive northwest of <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, grocer <PERSON> Baris </PERSON> explained that 15 years ago he traded his ice cream parlor at <LOCATION> Adana </LOCATION> in the southern <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> for an uncertain future in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, The 38-year-old immigrant started out as a waiter, then became a factory worker and now owns the grocery store that doubles as a tailoring and alterations service in <LOCATION> Koenigstein </LOCATION>. Like most Turks, <PERSON> Baris </PERSON> has no immediate plans to return home. `` If the economic situation in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> improves, then maybe some day,'' he said. <PERSON> Baris </PERSON>' grocery store sells ornamented samovars and Turkish coffee pots, water pipes, dried eggplant, Bulgarian goat cheese, Greek olives, <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> coffee, dozens of Turkish spices and mineral water, and even casette tapes of Turkish music. <PERSON> Baris </PERSON> said 90 percent of his customers in Koenigstein are West Germans. He opened his business five years ago and took a 250,000-mark -LRB- $ 148,000 -RRB- loan to buy a house. <PERSON> Baris </PERSON>, his wife and two Turks work in the store. All of <PERSON> Baris </PERSON>' four daughters were born in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Two of them, aged 12 and 10, go to a German school. The two younger ones, 6 and 4 years old, go to a Roman Catholic-run kindergarten. In <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Melek </PERSON> <PERSON> Kapicioglu </PERSON> followed a similar pattern. She came to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> 22 years ago, as a 19-year-old girl.

 Some beer fanciers have brushed off as a passing fancy the popularity of Corona Extra, the biggest-selling Mexican beer in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Market experts questioned whether the light lager could compete in an import market traditionally dominated by darker and heavier European brews. Not so <PERSON> Valentin </PERSON> <PERSON> Diez </PERSON> <PERSON> of </PERSON> <PERSON> Cervecerias </PERSON> <PERSON> Modelo </PERSON>, the makers of <PERSON> Corona </PERSON>. Under his guidance as <PERSON> Modelo </PERSON>'s general sales director, <PERSON> Corona </PERSON> has vaulted into second place among imported beers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and the company is aiming to be No. 1. In the process, <PERSON> Grupo </PERSON> <PERSON> Modelo </PERSON>, the brewery's parent company, is exemplifying President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>'s controversial effort to wean Mexican industry off years of subsidies and trade protection to create an export-driven economy that can successfully compete abroad. `` We want to be a model for all Mexican businesses by giving prestige and credibility to Mexican products abroad,'' <PERSON> Diez </PERSON> said at his <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> headquarters. A growing number of American beer drinkers are convinced. Americans consumed 25 million cases of Corona Extra last year, more than double the 1986 figure and 10 times above that just six years ago. <PERSON> Corona </PERSON> captured 18 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> import market in 1987, second only to <ORGANIZATION> Heineken </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> with 25 percent, according to <ORGANIZATION> Impact </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, a New York-based publication that monitors the beer industry. And with <PERSON> Corona </PERSON> now available in only 36 states, <PERSON> Grupo </PERSON> <PERSON> Modelo </PERSON> directors have reason to believe they'll achieve their goal. <PERSON> Diez </PERSON> cited strict quality control, strong advertising and sound marketing as reasons for <PERSON> Corona </PERSON>'s export success. But it has been sound financial planning at home that has steered Modelo through <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s economic crisis. Tight credit, rising costs, slack consumer demand and crushing private debts have hurt many Mexican businesses, including <PERSON> Modelo </PERSON>'s chief competitor, <PERSON> Cuauhtemoc </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION> Modelo avoided these pitfalls by refusing to borrow to finance investment, when borrowing from foreign lenders was the rage in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The company continuously plowed its earnings back into the firm. `` Grupo Modelo's policy always has been to grow using its own resources. That means no debts,'' <PERSON> Diez </PERSON> said. `` We did it by reinvesting all of our dividends over the years to construct our own breweries, malt and glass producing firms, our own warehouses and distributors. `` Many at the time thought we were wrong. But this policy has allowed us to consolidate our leadership position in the Mexican beer industry.'' Modelo brands now account for nearly half the Mexican market and 60 percent of all Mexican beer exports, <PERSON> Diez </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Corona </PERSON> has been available in western <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> states since 1966. But sales growth was limited because a Puerto Rican brewery owned the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rights to the familiar Corona blue-and-white crown trademark. <PERSON> Cervecerias </PERSON> <PERSON> Modelo </PERSON> was able to arrange a concurrent use agreement in 1983 and bought the trademark two years later. `` With the trademark question out of the way, this allowed us to launch ourselves into the market,'' <PERSON> Diez </PERSON> said. Not quite. Modelo's governing board insisted on introducing the lager into the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market on a gradual basis rather than trying to flood it all at once. <PERSON> Corona </PERSON> showed up first in restaurants and bars before it appeared in liquor stores and supermarkets. The beer became identified with trendy establishments and ethnic cuisine. `` They do n't want to just open a market,'' said <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Viejo </PERSON>, a sales director at <LOCATION> Modelo </LOCATION>. `` They work it, service it. It is n't just, ` Hey, here's a new brand. No way.'' <PERSON> Corona </PERSON>'s popularity has benefited from a slick advertising campaign, with its `` Cross the Border'' message linking the lager to Mexican tourist attractions in magazines and on billboards. In <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Modelo </PERSON> has pushed its premium beer at sporting events. The beer's logo is found everywhere inside <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s Social Security Park, home to the city's <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Devils </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> professional baseball teams, and at boxing arenas The sports angle is being developed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as well. A promotional stint during the week of the <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> college basketball championships featured six Corona bottles, two of them empty, and the slogan: `` On to the Final Four.'' A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> decision to revoke trade preferences for Mexican beer in 1987 did n't hurt <PERSON> Corona </PERSON>'s sales growth. Instead, the company judged it a sign that the brew could successfully compete on equal terms with other American imports. So has President de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>'s administration, which cited <ORGANIZATION> Cervecerias </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Modelo </ORGANIZATION> for export achievements. And Diez's colleagues in the <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sales </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executives </ORGANIZATION> designated him their distinguished executive of the year in 1987. Increased competitiveness means facing the prospect of more imported beers in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> as well. A trade agreement signed with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year will allow many American beers in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> for the first time. Diez is confident <PERSON> Modelo </PERSON> will rise to the challenge. `` We welcome them, having plain confidence that the quality of our beers will allow us to freely compete with the best beers in the world,'' he said. With new markets opening up in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Carolinas </LOCATION> this year, Diez predicts Corona sales will jump an additional 15 percent. The company hopes its other leading export brands, <PERSON> Negra </PERSON> <PERSON> Modelo </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Modelo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Especial </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Pacifico </PERSON>, also will catch on with American beer drinkers. <PERSON> Corona </PERSON> is making inroads in other countries. The lager was recently introduced in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, and after just one year it is the third-leading import by volume in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Distributors in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> have expressed interest in <LOCATION> Corona </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Diez </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Viejo </PERSON>, the sales director, dismissed some experts' opinion that <PERSON> Corona </PERSON> may already be falling out of the trendy import category in the American market. `` I would n't worry about it as long as they keep talking about it,'' he said. `` Corona is not in or out. It's a mainstream brand.'' <PERSON> Corona </PERSON> did fall into the list of `` outs'' for beers in <ORGANIZATION> BusinessWeek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION>'s trends list for 1988. The brew that took its place in the `` in'' column: <LOCATION> Negra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Modelo </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Sunset''</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 No one is better qualified than <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> to create a movie about the early days of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>: He is a third-generation filmmaker; his grandfather was a silent film director; his father was an assistant director and production manager. His daughter, <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON>, a promising actress, makes it four generations. The latest movie from the prolific <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> -LRB- `` Breakfast at <ORGANIZATION> Tiffany </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>,'' `` The Great Race,'' `` 10'' -RRB- is `` Sunset,'' an affectionate, funny, exhilarating glimpse at what <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> in the 1920s might have been _ `` give or take one or two lies,'' as one of the characters explains. Based on a book by <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Amateau </PERSON>, <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>' script contains a delicious idea: the teaming of <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON> <PERSON> Earp </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Mix </PERSON> to solve a <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> murder case. The juxtaposition of an authentic Western hero and a gaudy star of horse operas makes a splendid metaphor. And <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> adds another element from movie lore: the bootlegging Mafia. The plotting of `` Sunset'' becomes a bit convoluted for easy comprehension, and the heroics grow far-fetched. But the movie rolls along with <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>' faultless pacing, and most of all, by the inspired casting of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Garner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON>. They are the slickest screen pairing since <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Redford </PERSON>. The two mythic heroes are brought together when <PERSON> Earp </PERSON> comes to <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> as technical adviser for a movie in which he will be portrayed by Mix. After an early antagonism, the pair develop a mutual respect and visit a luxurious Hollywood brothel. When one of the leading ladies of the evening turns up dead, Earp and Mix are plunged into a web of intrigue that leads to the doorstep of studio head <PERSON> Alfie </PERSON> <PERSON> Alperin </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> McDowell </PERSON> -RRB-, once a silent movie clown. <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, who has a long history of battles with studio bosses, must have delighted in making one one of the villains of `` Sunset.'' The story involves a wide range of characters, including the dead woman's daughter -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Mariel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hemingway </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, a crooked cop -LRB- <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> -RRB-, the oily studio police chief -LRB- <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Emmet </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> -RRB- and an underworld lord -LRB- <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Dallesandro </PERSON> -RRB-. They interweave, sometimes confusingly, but most of the elements unweave at the end. <PERSON> Garner </PERSON> is a marvel to watch, his quiet authority dominating every scene. But <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> also shows his best big-screen form yet, capturing the flamboyance of Mix as well as his self-mockery. The Tri-Star Pictures release was produced by <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>. The rating is R, for language and sexual content. Running time: 101 minutes.

 Say it is n't so. But it is. Home videos for babies. We're talking infants here, not children. Well, why not. After all, there are books for babies _ those soft, washable squishy things with big, bright drawings of animals and toys and virtually no words _ so why not videos? V.I.E.W. Video, an acronym for <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>, is releasing `` <LOCATION> Infantasia </LOCATION> _ A Musical Mobile for You and Baby'' just in time for Mother's Day. The 25-minute videocassette in VHS sells for $ 19.95 and features shapes, colors, animation and nursery rhymes a 5 or 6-month-old baby or older could enjoy. There's a happy blue bird chirping away with moving musical notes, and cute bunny rabbits cavorting on a sunny, verdant landscrape. There are 11 songs including `` Pop Goes the Weasel,'' `` <PERSON> Brahms </PERSON>' Lullaby'' and `` Three Blind Mice.'' `` I've tried to create a world of color, shape and song which would be both fun and learning for baby,'' said <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION>, who designed `` Infantasia.'' Hi-Tops Video has a $ 14.95, 30-minute cassette for youngsters 5 and under called `` Babysongs,'' featuring such tunes as `` Do n't Wash My Blanket Today. From Pacific Arts Video for $ 19.95 is a 90-minute `` The Little Prince'' for kids 5-12. The Claymation animation is based on the St. Exupery book. Elsewhere in the home video world, <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> will release `` 1900'' in June. The epic about the rise of fascism in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> stars <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Niro </PERSON> and is directed by <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertolucci </PERSON>, whose `` The Last Emperor'' recently won nine Academy Awards. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION> will release `` Nuts'' next month, starring Barbra Streisand and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreyfuss </PERSON> in a courtroom drama. Videos reviewed this week: `` The Untouchables,'' `` Adventures in Babysitting'' and `` Hiding Out.'' `` The Untouchables'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION>; VHS, $ 89.95 @ Beta, 29.95; Rated R -RRB- `` The Untouchables'' is much more than a stylish remake of the old television series, even though good guy G-men still bust <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> ganglords during Prohibition. The <PERSON> Eliot </PERSON> <PERSON> Ness </PERSON> played by <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Costner </PERSON> is a teetotaler and loving father who compromises his killing principles as he conquers thugs who murder a 10-year-old girl with a bomb. He saves babies in runaway carriages with one hand and tosses gangsters from buildings with the other. The squeaky clean <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> agent frets when he shoots hoodlums, but he openly challenges mobsters and dutifully avenges the murder of his friends. He fights the mob with accountants and bullets, overcoming crooked cops and judges. The <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Capone </PERSON> played by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> DeNiro </PERSON> appears too little in the 119-minute film, directed by <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> and written by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mamet </PERSON>. But the savage butchery of his criminal empire comes across. <PERSON> DeNiro </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Capone </PERSON> is a a boss who keeps his troops in line with bat-wielding brutality. He jokes with reporters, bribes the legal system and cries at the opera at the same time he's being told of a successful killing. <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Connery </PERSON> won an Academy Award as best supporting actor for his role as an honest cop who joins <PERSON> Ness </PERSON>. He offers this harsh advice on how to beat <PERSON> Capone </PERSON>: `` He pulls a knife, you pull a gun. He sends one of yours to the hospital, you send one of his to the morgue. That's the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> way.'' Fashions by <PERSON> Giorgio </PERSON> <PERSON> Armani </PERSON> enhance the film's stylishness. It has an R-rating for language and graphic violence, including a dinner scene with <PERSON> Capone </PERSON> that is not for the squeamish. But the good guys win. _ By <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dvorchak </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> National Writer.

 `` Adventures in Babysitting'' -LRB- Touchstone Home Video; VHS @ Beta, $ 89.95; Rated PG-13 `` Adventures in Babysitting'' is another adventure-comedy for the teen set from the <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Touchstone </ORGANIZATION> factory. <PERSON> Elisabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Shue </PERSON> -LRB- `` Karate Kid'' -RRB- stars as <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, a high school senior in a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb who reluctantly agrees to babysit for a neighbor's kids after her boyfriend stands her up. Then her best friend calls in panic from the downtown bus station _ she has run away from home, run out of money and begs <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> to come get her. So <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> and her three charges head down the expressway, where they promptly get a flat tire, discover <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> has forgotten her purse, fall in with a good-natured but impulsive tow truck driver and get led into a series of ever-more unlikely predicaments, mostly involving a sinister gang of auto thieves. The movie starts off promisingly, with a nice feel for the middle-class suburban milieu and a disarming spontaneity that makes you eager to see what weird thing will happen next. But as the complications grow, screenwriter <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Simkins </PERSON> begins relying too much on stock situations, such as car chases and people hanging from 40th-story windows. Before it all ends, with everyone safely tucked into bed, <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> discovers that her boyfriend is a two-timing louse and has already started a new romance with a kind-hearted college kid. Miss <PERSON> Shue </PERSON>, a lovely and spirited young actress, comes through it all remarkably well, and the kids are n't bad either. A fair amount of raunchy language explains the PG-13 rating. _ By <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` Hiding Out'' -LRB- HBO Video; VHS @ Beta, $ 89.99; Rated PG-13 -RRB- Some movies are a frothy treat on television, but a waste of money and time in a movie theater. `` Hiding Out'' is one such flick. On the small screen, this comedy thriller starring <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Cryer </PERSON> -LRB- `` Pretty in Pink'' -RRB- is a fun diversion for teens hanging out together on a rainy Saturday with a killer pizza and lots of wonderful junk food. <PERSON> Cryer </PERSON> plays a stockbroker who is to testify about a mob bonds scandal. Other witnesses have been rubbed out and <PERSON> Cryer </PERSON> is put under federal investigation. His agents are as effective as <PERSON> Bozo </PERSON> the Clown in protecting him and after one <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent is killed, he escapes to an aunt's house, poses as a high school student named <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> <PERSON> Hauser </PERSON> -LRB- he takes the name from a coffee can -RRB- and becomes the most popular kid on campus. The fun _ and the adventure _ emerge as <PERSON> Cryer </PERSON>'s split personality as BMOC and fugitive stockbroker collide. There are a few laughs, some predictable gangster thrills and a little romance. But do n't expect major league acting. There are, however, some pretty important values in growing up. _ By <PERSON> Dolores </PERSON> <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editor </ORGANIZATION>.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gershwin </PERSON>: Rhapsody in <LOCATION> Blue </LOCATION>, Concerto in F _ <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Tritt </PERSON>, piano; The <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pops </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orchestra </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunzel </PERSON> conducting. The popularity of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gershwin </PERSON>'s `` Rhapsody in Blue'' owes a lot to the orchestration prepared by <PERSON> Ferde </PERSON> <PERSON> Grofe </PERSON> in 1942. But there was an earlier version, also <PERSON> Grofe </PERSON>'s work, for <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Whiteman </PERSON>'s `` Experiment in Modern Music'' at the Aeolian Hall in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in 1924 This was the version, and this was the concert, that established `` Rhapsody in Blue'' as an American standard. <PERSON> Whiteman </PERSON> commissioned <PERSON> Gershwin </PERSON> on the strength of the composer's Broadway successes, notably `` Swanee'' for <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Jolson </PERSON> in 1920 Setting to work just a month before the concert, <PERSON> Gershwin </PERSON> wrote a solo piano part and a second piano part which represented the orchestra. <PERSON> Grofe </PERSON> then helped in orchestrating the piece for eight violins, double bass, three woodwinds, two horns, two trombones, tuba, tympani, banjo, celeste, percussion and piano. It is this orchestration which the <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> Pops Orchestra has recreated, using 24 players in the guise of the <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jazz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION>. It's a beguiling performance. Despite the digital clarity, the small forces evoke the sound of old 78 rpm recordings and those make-believe ballrooms of the early days of radio. Delightful though it is, the recording also affirms the rightness of the more familiar 1942 version. In its final bars, `` Rhapsody'' begs for more oomph than two dozen players can muster. The Concerto in F, variations on `` I Got Rhythm'' and the `` Rialto Ripples'' rag, performed by the full pops orchestra, round out a very satisfying hour-plus compact disc. _ By <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` <PERSON> Pinker </PERSON> and Prouder Than Previous'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> <PERSON> Forgive </PERSON> <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> for feeling a little baffled about what the general public wants in its music stars. This veteran British rocker has done everything but jump through hoops in an attempt to break through during the past few years. He released two solid albums, including the exceptional `` Rose of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>,'' after a string of inferior early 1980s records. He rerecorded one of his best songs, `` I Knew the Bride'' with <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> and the News. Still, no luck. The back cover of his new album, `` <PERSON> Pinker </PERSON> and Prouder Than Previous,'' shows <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> standing against a brick wall, gazing wistfully at a street sign called `` Market Place.'' The relaxed tone of `` Pinker'' suggests <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> has thrown up his hands and just decided to do what's comfortable. While the results are a few notches below his last two records, `` Pinker'' has its moments. <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>'s a rock' n' roller, as he constantly tried to reassure fans who saw him on a solo acoustic tour last year, but he takes a few intriguing left turns at the outset of this record. `` You're My Wildest Dream'' is a roadhouse blues number backed by the Fabulous Thunderbirds, and `` Crying in My Sleep'' is a rare ballad. He cajoles two fine contributions from friends who happen to be sterling songwriters. `` Love Gets Strange'' is a <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiatt </PERSON> throwaway for which many songwriters would kill, and `` <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>,'' by <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, is a rollicking good time. Yet what's designed as this album's showcase is oddly disappointing. <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> briefly reunites with former Rockpile partner <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Edmunds </PERSON>, with whom he spent much of the 1980s feuding. But the reunion is only for one song, and instead of complementing the album, `` Lovers Jamboree'' stands uncomfortably apart. One hopes the slightly disjointed feel of this record does n't herald a return to <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>'s early'80s sloppiness He's too much fun, even when not at his best, to lose heart over a lack of commercial success. _ By <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauder </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

<HEAD>Star Watch: Demi Moore Graduates From Brat Pack</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Once a reluctant member of the much-maligned Brat Pack, <PERSON> Demi </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> has graduated to become a star in her own right, a budding producer, wife of <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> of TV's `` Moonlighting'' fame and a future mother These dizzying changes have somehow left the actress more serene than ever. During a recent interview at <ORGANIZATION> Tri-Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>, where she occupies offices for development of screen projects, she seemed calm and controlled, a 25-year-old confident of the future. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> currently stars in `` The Seventh Sign'' as a pregnant wife who is the central figure in a present-day threat of a biblical apocalypse. The film has received a cool response from reviewers and the public. `` A lot of people have commented that it might be in that genre of films such as ` <PERSON> Rosemary </PERSON>'s Baby' and ` The Omen,''' she said. `` I do n't think we set out for it to be that type of film. When I read the script, the story always had an uplifting message, whereas those other films always dealt with the devil and the concept of an outside, evil force coming in and taking over. `` For me the only evil force in the movie is the human race and what we're doing to ourselves. `` It's the first time I've had to carry a movie, and on that level it was more challenging,'' she said. `` Also, it's a different character, and the subject matter was much weightier. I've always been associated with light, romantic comedies.'' <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said some of her roles, in such movies as `` About Last Night'' and `` St. Elmo's Fire'' had `` moments of emotional depth that had to be reached. Particularly, ` About Last Night' exposed that I was capable of more than just a frivolous, looking-good -LRB- character -RRB-.'' Tri-Star thought so, and she is now developing a film project based on a book she discovered. `` You just ca n't be at the studios' mercy to bring you that ideal role,'' she said <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, whose parents spotted the name <PERSON> Demi </PERSON> in a fashion magazine, had an unsettled childhood. She attended 30 different schools as her advertising manager father moved to various newspapers of a large chain. Her childhood curiously parallels those of other young stars such as <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruise </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mornay </PERSON>. `` That experience definitely has something to do with how I ended up here,'' <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said. `` When you move around a lot, you're always having to adjust and fit in, meet people and situations `` I've talked to a number of people who have had similar experiences, <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> being one. I do n't quite know what it is. Maybe it's just being able to adjust, fit in, cope, create whatever you need to survive, make it work. `` There are two choices: You can become introverted, isolated and alone; or you can become extroverted and put yourself out there and try to fit into the group so you're not alone. I do n't think that always leaves you with a great sense of yourself or of security.'' <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> chose to be extroverted, and at 16 she dropped out of school to become a model. She had the flawless beauty, but at 5 feet-5 -LCB- inches, not the height. So she took acting classes and at 18 landed the role of <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Templeton </PERSON> on the TV soap `` General Hospital.'' Her first major film role was in `` Blame It on <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>,'' in which she appeared topless as <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Caine </PERSON>'s headstrong daughter. More films followed: `` No Small Affair,'' `` St. Elmo's Fire,'' `` One Crazy Summer,'' `` Wisdom.'' In the latter, she co-starred with <PERSON> Emilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Estevez </PERSON>, who was then her fiance. Last Nov. 21 she married <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>. She said their baby is due in late summer <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> was well prepared for her pregnancy. To research `` The Seventh Sign,'' she talked to pregnant women and obstetricians and visited delivery rooms. `` It was a lot of fun for me,'' she said. `` I had a leotard suit with a belly that weighed 10 to 15 pounds. I wore it for two weeks before the film started, to get the feeling, the walk. People responded to me differently. `` I also had a prosthetic device which was sculpted of rubber and took six hours to apply, gluing it to my skin. Thank God I only had to wear it four or five times. `` For me it is much more exciting that I got to play pregnant and make it so realistic, and now to have the real thing happen.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Soprano Worked Overtime As Met Season Wound Down</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE SILVERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 She's a bird! She's a maid! She's a flirtatious landowner! She's a kid sister! She's <PERSON> Dawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Upshaw </PERSON>, supersoprano, and during the final weeks of the Metropolitan Opera season, her sweet, lyric voice seemed to be piping up all over the place. `` If anybody had told me I was going to be doing what I did this season, I'd have been flabbergasted,'' Miss <PERSON> Upshaw </PERSON> said in a recent interview. `` It was very draining.'' What she did, within the space of two months, was sing the off-stage role of the <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bird </LOCATION> in <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>'s `` Siegfried''; the comic housemaid <PERSON> Despina </PERSON> in <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON>'s `` Cosi Fan Tutte''; <PERSON> Adina </PERSON>, the heroine of <PERSON> Donizetti </PERSON>'s `` The Elixir of Love''; and <PERSON> Sophie </PERSON>, the younger sister of <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> in <PERSON> Massenet </PERSON>'s `` Werther.'' `` It's not something I would want to do very often _ so many different things all at once,'' she said. `` The preparation was not the problem; it was more concentration.'' The centerpiece of all this activity was four performances as <PERSON> Adina </PERSON>, by far the biggest role the 27-year-old soprano has sung at the Met, and one she almost did n't sing at all. `` I was the cover -LRB- understudy -RRB- for <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Battle </PERSON>, and supposed to be singing the smaller role of <LOCATION> Giannetta </LOCATION>,'' she said. `` The night of the first performance I was on my way out the door at 10 to 7 when I got the call saying <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> was sick and could I please go on as <PERSON> Adina </PERSON>.'' The same question had been put to her last fall when illness forced <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Blegen </PERSON> to cancel a run of <LOCATION> Adinas </LOCATION>. `` They gave me a choice of going on, but it was a new role, a new style for me,'' she said. `` I thought, ` No, I'd better wait.' They were very nice, they did n't pressure me to rush in.'' In February, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Upshaw </PERSON> decided she was ready _ and the critics agreed. `` The result was a highly successful, charming performance, as might have been expected from one of the most critically admired singers of her generation,'' wrote <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockell </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. She drew equal praise for the other roles she sang in her late-season burst. As <PERSON> Sophie </PERSON>, declared the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, she displayed `` a voice as fresh as spring.'' As <PERSON> Despina </PERSON>, said Times critic <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Crutchfield </PERSON>, she was `` a joy to the ear.'' <PERSON> Despina </PERSON> put her in the midst of a backstage drama that Miss <PERSON> Upshaw </PERSON> would just as soon forget. The Korean soprano Hei-Kjung Hong _ another budding Met star at age 29 _ had been scheduled to sing the opening performance. However, according to some accounts, the evening's star, soprano <PERSON> Kiri </PERSON> <PERSON> Te </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanawa </PERSON>, expressed displeasure and demanded that she not join the cast until the second performance. `` All I know is, someone I know there called and asked me, ` could you come in, we do n't think <PERSON> Hei-Kjung </PERSON>'s quite ready for the first performance,''' Miss <PERSON> Upshaw </PERSON> said. `` It's not something I'd care to discuss with <PERSON> Hei-Kjung </PERSON> Our friendship is just as it was before. This did n't have anything to do with the two of us.'' Though this was Miss <PERSON> Upshaw </PERSON>'s fourth season at the Met, most of her previous appearances were in tiny roles, starting with a debut as the <PERSON> Countess </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceprano </PERSON> in <PERSON> Verdi </PERSON>'s `` Rigoletto.'' `` I think I had two lines,'' she recalled. <PERSON> Verdi </PERSON> is not a composer of whose works she expects to sing a lot. Miss <PERSON> Upshaw </PERSON> describes herself as `` a lyric soprano, but the quality is not strictly soubrette,'' meaning she is well-suited for parts more substantial than the traditional comic maid. `` But my voice is not heavy enough for <PERSON> Puccini </PERSON>, not even <PERSON> Mimi </PERSON> -LRB- in ` La Boheme' -RRB-,'' she said. There was a time when <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Upshaw </PERSON>, who grew up in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb of Park Forest, had her sights set no higher than singing jingles in TV commercials. `` While I was in high school I worked as a secretary for a jingle producer,'' she said. `` I thought: ` this looks good. People come in, sing for five minutes, go home, and that's how they make their living.'' Her plan was to study singing in college and become an expert sight-reader, a requirement for professional jingling. But when she went to <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wesleyan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, she discovered the world of classical music and began to think of a somewhat loftier career. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Nott </PERSON>, her voice teacher at <LOCATION> Wesleyan </LOCATION> and the school's choral director, encouraged her to attend the <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> after she graduated There she studied with <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Faull </PERSON>, a former opera singer and highly respected teacher. During the summers, she made the rounds of American music festivals, such as <LOCATION> Aspen </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Tanglewood </ORGANIZATION>, studying with established singers and developing a reputation of her own as an up-and-comer. She also attracted the attention of the Met, which put her into its informal internship program for young artists. `` Like many singers of my age, I did n't have to work for years in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> before being accepted here,'' Miss <PERSON> Upshaw </PERSON> said. `` I think maybe Americans are becoming very proud of our own singers.'' Next year's Met schedule calls for her to be just as busy as this season, `` but it'll be more spread out.'' She'll repeat the <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bird </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sophie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Giannetta </PERSON> and also sing <PERSON> Ilia </PERSON> in <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON>'s `` Idomeneo. Down the road, she will be Zerlina when the Met stages its long-awaited new production of <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON>'s `` <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Giovanni </PERSON>.'' When not singing at the Met, <LOCATION> Miss </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Upshaw </LOCATION> _ who makes her home in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with her musicologist husband _ keeps busy performing solo recitals and singing at major European summer festivals, including <LOCATION> Salzburg </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Aix-en-Provence </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Music Makers: A Former Doll Is Hot, Hot, Hot</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Some rockers turn gray, still rocking. Not <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Johansen </PERSON>. The former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Doll got tired of rock and the road. So he put some brilliantine on his still-dark hair, worked it into a Little <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> pompadour, donned a tuxedo and became a jaded lounge lizard named <PERSON> Buster </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>. He became the toast of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> with a slick deco act that best resembled a collaboration between P.G. <PERSON> Wodehouse </PERSON> and <PERSON> Noel </PERSON> <PERSON> Coward </PERSON>. And the songs he did were novelties and saloon tunes with witty anecdotes. He played at a club called Tramps with his five-piece Banshees of Blue, and moved to the Bottom Line with his 11-piece Banshees of Blue. Then he went national. `` Saturday Night Live'' snapped him up. He was interviewed on `` The Tonight Show Starring <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>,'' signed for `` Miami Vice'' and appeared in ads for Amaretto liqueur. His new album for RCA, `` <PERSON> Buster </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>,'' has been on best-selling charts for months. `` Hot Hot Hot,'' a tune he once heard on a <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> vacation sung by a calypso king named Arrow, was the first single. His newest single, also borrowed, is `` Oh Me Oh My,'' which was recorded in 1925 by the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orleans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Owls </ORGANIZATION>. And <PERSON> Buster </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> is playing dates in much nicer rooms than <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Johansen </PERSON> ever did. `` I like places where your feet do n't stick to the floor,'' he said. `` Until I had the album, there was no going out as <PERSON> Buster </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>. People would n't come. You can have the greatest show on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> but if they have n't heard of you they're not going to come out and see you.'' The 38-year-old <PERSON> Johansen </PERSON> explained the reasons for his new persona: `` I'd been doing a straight rock' n' roll show for many years and I got tired of it. I think I outgrew it. I wanted to do something a little more sophisticated and something I could entertain people of all ages with, instead of just kids. `` As solo performer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Johansen </PERSON> -LRB- after the 1973-75 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Dolls heyday -RRB-, a lot of things I would say were going over the audience's heads. Now I'm in a situation where I can be funny. It is very satisfying. `` Every year you're singing rock you get older but the kids stay the same age. <PERSON> Buster </PERSON> is suitable entertainment for all ages. People who like rock like <PERSON> Buster </PERSON>.'' He chose the `` obscurities from days gone by'' for the album. `` The reason I started doing <PERSON> Buster </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> was, I wanted to sing all these songs I've cataloged in my head. ... It was n't like I seriously expected to do this. `` I did n't stop doing the other thing and start doing this. I started Monday nights at Tramps. I said I was <PERSON> Buster </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> so they would n't come expecting to see <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Johansen </PERSON>'s schtick. For six months maybe I was singing as both. It was a natural progression. Now guys on the street go, ` Yo, <PERSON> Buster </PERSON>.''' <PERSON> Johansen </PERSON> is married to portrait photographer <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>. He started in show business in the campy, gay theater troupe, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Ludlum </PERSON>'s Ridiculous Theater, and moved on to become lead singer in a campy, male rock group, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dolls </ORGANIZATION>, who wore high heels and makeup. `` I guess I was a precocious kid,'' he said in an interview. `` Most of the people in my family sing, dance, are always in plays. I was the least inclined in that direction. I'm the one who took it up as a profession. Now my mother comes to my shows all the time with her friends.'' His Norwegian father, who died three years ago, was a light opera singer who became an insurance salesman when he and his Irish wife had the first of their six children. `` We always went to see Broadway shows when we were kids,'' <PERSON> Johansen </PERSON> said. `` I liked them all.'' At home on <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Johansen </PERSON>'s street name was <PERSON> Buster </PERSON>. `` I was the one in the gang who read books,'' he says. `` They called me <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>. Some people have that wanderlust both physically and intellectually. I had a band in high school, the Blue Banshees. I wanted to revive that name, for whatever reason I'm not sure.'' After high school, he worked for people who owned a store. One of them was in the late <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Ludlum </PERSON>'s theater company. `` I just kind of fell into it. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Ludlum </PERSON> was a brilliant man, very generous with his information. I learned a lot. It was like an apprenticeship. I was a lion in one play, a saint in one. I was an extra, really. `` Then I started up the New York Dolls. At that time rock was very blue jeans and flannel shirts. We wanted to bring a sense of flamboyance, fantasy and fun to it. The way we dressed scared the homophobes -LRB- people afraid of homosexuals -RRB-. `` We got involved with each other because we looked like that. ... I do n't think we thought what we were doing was particularly outrageous. I think it translated that way. We made two albums for Mercury, released many times _ the best of, very best of, complete works of. `` It has been said the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Dolls were the beginning of punk. I do n't agree. I think it was classic rock' n' roll we played. I wrote lyrics that were teen angst with a sense of humor.'' <PERSON> Johansen </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dolls </ORGANIZATION> broke up because they got tired of each other. `` We were very volatile. We'd have an argument; that would be it. Most people would say, ` We still have this viable gig.' Not us. We were amateur, I guess. `` In retrospect, it was a project that was completed. I do n't want to go around looking like that forever I see grown men still wearing their mother's clothes. I say, ` There but for the grace, go I.''' After the breakup, <PERSON> Johansen </PERSON> and another band member made money touring <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Johansen </PERSON> now calls them the Dollettes. Then he wrote songs and made six solo albums for Epic, continually touring the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for eight years. `` I love to sing,'' he says. `` It's the schlep that kills me.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: On Foot Through the Rain Forest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE JAHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> has vivid memories of the split second it took to make the decision: turn his back on civilization and return to the <LOCATION> Borneo </LOCATION> jungle he had just spent five months crossing on foot. Six years after his marathon trip, other memories continue to haunt <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>, who relates his experiences in his new book, `` Stranger in the Forest _ On Foot Across <LOCATION> Borneo </LOCATION>'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Houghton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mifflin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, $ 17.95 -RRB-. He recalls his brush with death with former headhunters convinced he was an evil spirit, and his fantasies about cross-country skiing while trudging through the hot, leech and insect-infested rain forest. Departing from <LOCATION> Kuching </LOCATION> in the west in May 1982, <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> made a 2,500-mile journey through uncharted rain forest to <LOCATION> Tanjungselor </LOCATION> in the east and back, carrying only a bed sheet, a change of clothes and barter goods. He had the company of guides for much of the time, but also traveled alone. He emerged a changed man, a spear-wielding hunter and a gatherer whose Western sense of time had washed away. `` After spending five months in the jungle, I was n't fully aware of how much I had changed,'' <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said. `` Then I went back two more months, and I had changed even more.'' In <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, his first real exposure to civilization afterwards, `` there was all this traffic and the pollution ... and I was acutely aware of the fact that there were no trees at all. And I felt much more uncomfortable coming back into Western society than I had going into the jungle.'' Civilization lost its terrors within about two months for the author. But long-term changes remain to this day. `` I'm much more patient, much more resilient. ... It's very much developed my self-confidence,'' he said in a recent interview. The <LOCATION> Borneo </LOCATION> journey was not the first adventure for the 40-year-old <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> native, who has traveled to <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. He also has worked as a goldsmith, a buffalo catcher and as a barber for <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON>'s home for the destitute in <LOCATION> Calcutta </LOCATION>. Like his other experiences, <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said that the decision to embark on a rain forest odyssey was compulsive. `` I think a lot of us fantasized about a place we want to go or a situation we would like to be in and most of us are quite happy to keep it on that fantasy level,'' he said. `` I thought about going to <LOCATION> Borneo </LOCATION> for five or six years and it became an overwhelming desire on my part.'' <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>'s 278-page book is at its most fascinating when it juxtaposes civilization against the rain forest and its creatures _ the author among them. Among such vignettes is an episode describing the aftermath of a wild boar hunt with parangs _ heavy knives: `` Squatting on my haunches, I could feel the fat running down my forearms and dripping from my elbows. I was totally absorbed in the meal when I heard a vaguely familiar droning sound growing louder and louder. `` I looked up through a gap in the jungle canopy and saw, for perhaps five seconds, a commercial airliner. `` I imagined myself sitting on the plane. ... Far below, at the edge of a small clearing, almost hidden from sight, I could see myself seated by a campfire with two brown-skinned jungle men, speaking an unknown language. Nearby lay the steaming carcass of a wild boar. `` From that perspective I suddenly realized what an astonishing situation I was in: submerged in a sea of giant trees, hunting wild animals, a bloodied parang at my waist _ the stuff of pure fantasy six months earlier.'' <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>'s encounter with American missionaries and his decision to retrace his steps is perhaps the keystone episode and clearly explains the triteness of `` civilization'' to a man grown accustomed to harsher realities. `` <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> and <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> were perched nervously on the edge of their seats staring at me, perhaps waiting for me to disappear. I looked at the Christian paintings, calendars and framed scriptural quotes that covered the walls. I had been in the jungle too long to make any sense of them. `` All these symbols seemed trite and out of place. And their puppy. That sweet-smelling freshly shampooed, little bundle of white fluff would have been torn to pieces in thirty seconds by the village hunting dogs.'' <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> chuckled as he thought back to that time. `` They had this little bungalow beside the jungle and inside the house was a perfect time capsule,'' he said. `` Everything about it was ridiculous, from the soap to the rugs, to the cookies in a jar. I was convinced that it had been brought by helicopter and just dropped there.'' In the book, he presents the forest and its inhabitants at their most frightening on his return trip, when he ignored the locals' advice and embarks alone during `` the season of fear,'' the former time for headhunting, when evil spirits lurk <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> was mistaken for a `` bali saleng'' _ half man, half spirit who kills for blood and who can not be killed. `` What I did not know was that the description of ` bali saleng' changed regularly,'' he writes `` At the time ... the description was ` a tall, white-skinned man with brownish hair who walks by himself in the jungle.''' His book describes several close calls with frightened natives, including one hair-raising encounter where he was stripped and cross-examined for hours, until he laboriously convinced his interrogators to let him free. <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said his journey left him none the worse for wear and that he is looking forward to his next project _ an extended tour of rugged <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION>. The slightly built, balding adventurer laughed heartily when told that he did not seem physically rugged enough for such experiences. `` I think there's a myth, fed by movies and television that it's the hairy-chested, gun-slinging, whip-wielding individual that ... conquers the mountain, or the river, or the woman or whatever,'' he said `` In fact, I've never seen anyone in real life like that get very far ... because they're the first ones to get sick, or complain or freak out when something happens. `` When they ca n't scream or pay somebody off, they give up.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Wolfman Jack Has New Show</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Legendary disc jockey Wolfman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> says his new cable TV show spotlighting the golden era of rock' n' roll rivals his old hit show, `` The Midnight Special.'' The Wolfman, who portrayed himself in the 1973 movie `` American Graffiti,'' is the host of `` Rock' n' Roll Palace'' on The <ORGANIZATION> Nashville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>. The 30-minute program is taped at Little <PERSON> Darlin </PERSON>'s Rock' n' Roll Palace in <LOCATION> Kissimmee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. The bearded host says he does not missing doing `` The Midnight Special,'' of which he was host for eight years, because the new program is so good. `` We have very special and wonderful people,'' the 49-year-old Wolfman said in an interview. `` We had a magic and it comes out on the tube. The show comes on and goes off fast. Everyone was inspired and wanted to be there and wanted to perform. It was very magical.'' Guests this season include the Diamonds, the <ORGANIZATION> Shirelles </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sands </PERSON>, the Coasters, <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyland </PERSON>, <PERSON> Joey </PERSON> <PERSON> Dee </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>, the Crystals, <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Vee </PERSON>, <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Reeves </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>, <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Tillotson </PERSON>, the Platters, the Crickets, <PERSON> Lenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Welch </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Freddie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cannon </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> and the Tokens. `` On TV, there's not one show going after these acts,'' the Wolfman said. `` This is the first show to come along and do this. `` It's real American music _ what rock' n' roll originally was before people turned it around and sideways and upside down. From 1958 to 1964, that's real rock' n' roll. Then the Beatles hit and everyone sounded like them. They did n't give our boys long enough. There were real classics from that era. `` The feeling of some of the music today is a little bit like that -LRB- era -RRB-, but the purity of rock' n' roll when it first came out was astounding,'' she said. `` It was pure, simple, nothing heavy, nothing but fun and romance. It had a good beat and you could dance to it. There were great ballads in those days.'' The Wolfman, who has a syndicated radio show on about 70 stations, said music today emphasizes the performer rather than the song. `` You do n't go see <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> for the song but for his great entertaining and dancing. You see a $ 2 million show. In the old days, you paid $ 2 - $ 3 and saw 18 acts Back then, everyone worked together. You try to put 18 acts together today and see what it costs you.'' The Wolfman said he has many fond memories of `` The Midnight Special,'' which he left in 1982 because the show was de-emphasizing live music, he said. `` There were some fine moments. I remember <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> and <PERSON> Aretha </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> and at the end of each show we'd jam This was very unusual for those days. For us to put them all together was very important.'' The Wolfman really is <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who grew up in a tough neighborhood in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> His character emerged in the 1960s from XERF, a Mexican station with a signal that carried into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He later was on XERB, another Mexican station. Then he appeared in the <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukas </PERSON> movie `` American Graffiti,'' which starred <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreyfuss </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, and briefly featured <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Somers </PERSON>. `` It took the Wolfman from a cult figure to the rank of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag and apple pie,'' he said. `` It made me legitimate. Most actors go all their life and try for that kind of opportunity. The Wolfman stumbled and fell into it. I am very lucky. `` So many people got started in that picture. It sort of became a classic.'' He's not so complimentary of a later movie, `` The Big Chill,'' which also featured'60s rock. `` It was kind of depressing, being about a funeral and all. But it did depict different kind of people in that age group. But I did n't particularly care for it.'' After `` American Graffiti,'' he began doing various advertising campaigns and appeared in more than 40 network TV shows. He also had his own syndicated TV show, `` The Wolfman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> Show.'' <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Rundgren </PERSON>, the Guess Who, <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Freddie </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> all wrote songs about him. He currently is a deejay for radio station <ORGANIZATION> XTRA </ORGANIZATION> Gold in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, broadcasting from his home in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. His voice, he said, has been very valuable to him `` It's kept meat and potatoes on the table for years for Wolfman and Wolfwoman. A couple of shots of whiskey helps it. I've got that nice raspy sound.''

<TEXT>
 Just before sunset, a golden glow warms the Big Sur coast where Highway 1 crosses <LOCATION> Bixby </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> on a bridge so graceful it improves its idyllic natural backdrop. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> native <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sears </PERSON> visits the area a half-dozen times a year just to stare at the stunning scene. `` I feel attached to this place,'' he says in a reverent tone. `` I lived in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> for 20 years. All the time I was gone, I kept dreaming about this particular highway, this particular spot. `` That's why I came home eventually.'' <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> is not alone in his enthusiasm for the wonders of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s 644-mile coastal highway. If you picture <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in your mind, chances are you are viewing it from Highway 1. Maybe it's the sight of surfers silhouetted against a <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monica </ORGANIZATION> sunset, or the brightly colored fishing boats chugging out of <LOCATION> Morro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. Perhaps it's the grandeur of Big Sur, or the quaint Main Street of <LOCATION> Mendocino </LOCATION>. If these are the jewels of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coast, Highway 1 is the necklace. It became the nation's first scenic highway in 1964, when the separate segments of the route were linked under the common name of Highway 1. The journey north begins at <LOCATION> Dana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> when the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> peels off from Interstate 5. A chain of beach towns makes up this land of surfboards and string bikinis: <LOCATION> Laguna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hermosa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Redondo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, Sunset, <PERSON> Santa </PERSON> <PERSON> Monica </PERSON>. Yachts take harbor at <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Laguna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> attracts artists. <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> is perforated with oil wells. Everywhere there are whitewashed walls of Spanish-style villas, red-tile roofs and dangling boughs of purple bougainvillea. The highway rolls past <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> and the famous <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION> pier en route to <LOCATION> Malibu </LOCATION>, where celebrities mingle with common folk. It's expensive The traffic is often jammed. The land is not stable. Grass fires threaten hillside mansions in the summer. Monster waves damage beachfront homes in the winter. Yet most people who live here would n't trade it for nirvana. Highway 1 passes through the lima bean fields and lemon orchards of <LOCATION> Ventura </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> as it heads up towards <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>. At <LOCATION> Gaviota </LOCATION>, it heads west on a journey through time that takes it from cow pastures into the space age. Giant radar domes and distant launch pads mark <ORGANIZATION> Vandenberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, the future home of the space shuttle. San <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Obispo </PERSON> was the site of a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> mission, later became a quiet college town and today is an oasis for motorists. With the Spanish-influenced architecture of its relaxed downtown, it proves an excellent tonic for those too long behind the wheel. Ten miles west is <LOCATION> Morro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, and a little farther up the coast lies <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Simeon </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearst </PERSON> built <ORGANIZATION> Hearst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Castle </ORGANIZATION>. The dozens of bedrooms in the main house once welcomed the likes of Gable and Lombard, presidents and kings. The mountaintop mansion is now a state park. The highway now enters <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sur </ORGANIZATION>, 70 miles of coast where the dramatic <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lucia </LOCATION> mountains drop suddenly to the sea. The highway dances with the mountains here, rising around a point high over the ocean, then falling gracefully into a sweeping curve before spinning again toward the sea. The deepest canyons are crowned with arching concrete spans built, like other parts of the highway, with the help of convict labor from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quentin </LOCATION> prison. The beauty of the 714-foot <LOCATION> Bixby </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> belies the difficulty of its construction from 300 tons of steel, 6,600 cubic yards of concrete and 300,000 board feet of <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> fir used as a falsework. Even though 1.5 million people drive through Big Sur each year, the scale of the landscape generates a feeling of isolation for some. The greatness of the area has inspired many writers and artists, including author <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> and photographer <PERSON> Ansel </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>. A half-hour north of <LOCATION> Bixby </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> sits reclusive Carmel-By-The-Sea, and a few miles farther rests <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION> with its once-bustling waterfront that now features one of the world's great aquariums. This is no longer the Cannery Row that <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON> immortalized a half-century ago. But millions still come here searching among the crumbling piers for the ghosts of Doc and Wide Ida. The highway races past Fort Ord on its way to the amusement park at the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> boardwalk, where a warm summer night conjures the smell of cotton candy and the cheap thrill of a rickety wooden roller coaster. Another 70 miles of coastline leads the highway to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> where the route's beauty is lost is a maze of traffic until resurfacing across the Golden Gate in <LOCATION> Marin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. The highway clings to the shoulders of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tamalpais </LOCATION> before reaching the funky communities of <LOCATION> Stinson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bolinas </LOCATION>. For many, a trip along Highway 1 on the north coast will seem redundant after the scenery further south. But the observant will find extraordinary beauty in the lagoons and grasslands that have become refuge to myriad species, including red tail hawks and peregrine falcons. Passing through the towns along the north coast _ <LOCATION> Bodega </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mendocino </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bragg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gualala </LOCATION> -LRB- pronounce it wuh-lah-lah -RRB- _ it is hard to imagine one is still in the same state as the sun -' n' - surf cities Soon, even the <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coast is a memory as the highway turns inland through virgin redwood groves and Indian reservations. At <LOCATION> Leggett </LOCATION>, the highway comes to an anti-climactic end when it meets Highway 101, and the traveler has the option of continuing on the more heavily traveled road _ or turning around and seeing what Highway 1 looks like from north to south.

 On a bluff with a sweeping view of the Big Sur coast, 808 feet above the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, sits a restaurant that serves something more with its burgers than a side of fries. <ORGANIZATION> Nepenthe </ORGANIZATION> has been a popular eatery on Highway 1 since the late 1940s, not just with the 1.5 million motorists who pass by annually, but with many of the writers, artists and thinkers who have given Big Sur its unique reputation as the birthplace of the human potential movement. The restaurant, designed by <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> <PERSON> Maiden </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> disciple, makes the most of its view with a dining room surrounded by picture windows and a wrap-around, bi-level patio. Inside and out, there are giant fireplaces to ward off the chill of the notorious coastal fog. The food, ranging from quiche and burgers to steaks and red snapper, is good and not unreasonably priced by Big Sur standards. But it's the history and people of <LOCATION> Nepenthe </LOCATION> that really makes the place special. The restaurant, named for a mythical Egyptian drug that induced forgetfulness and eased sorrow, sits beside a log cabin built by the equestrian <ORGANIZATION> Trails </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> in 1925. The cabin was purchased by <LOCATION> Orson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Welles </LOCATION> in the 1940s, reportedly as a gift for <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayworth </PERSON>. But she never lived there and the property was sold again to <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lolly </PERSON> <PERSON> Fassett </PERSON> in 1947. Today, <ORGANIZATION> Nepenthe </ORGANIZATION> is managed by their grandson, <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Fassett </PERSON>. Granddaughter <PERSON> Erin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fassett </PERSON> supervises the dining room and lives in the rustic cabin. Born and raised in Big Sur during the 1960s, they had a good view of social changes here, and of the changes in people who gave up the straight life somewhere else to seek an alternative lifestyle on the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coast. `` In Big Sur, there is really only one industry, the entertainment industry _ restaurants and inns,'' notes <PERSON> Erin </PERSON>. `` So people who wanted to live here, unless they were independently wealthy or self-employed, ended up working in restaurants. `` I know people who have Ph.D. s or were doctors and did n't want to be doctors anymore _ people who dropped out of a different life and were working here And that's still true ... These people have gone through a real rebirth in a way, a rejuvenation. They get excited about life again,'' she said. `` Every night, somebody comes through and says ` I came here 10 years ago and I was never able to forget it.' It's really kind of a haunting community. You do n't forget it very easily.''

 When Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> drove a 1929 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Model </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AA </ORGANIZATION> truck to open the final 33-mile stretch of Interstate 95 last Dec. 19, it marked the end of a superhighway project that began snaking its way from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> 32 years ago. The idea for the road was born in the 1940s as a way to speed up troop movement, when needed, while aiding the burgeoning <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> population. It was included in a national interstate network outlined in 1956 in the Federal Aid Highway Act signed into law by President <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>. Ambitious plans called for the entire network, 90 percent funded by the federal government, to be carrying traffic by 1972. It was designed as an unbroken freeway, but its 1,866 miles are interrupted in central <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, where there is a short gap near <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION>. The interstate picks up a few miles later, where it shares the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Turnpike </ORGANIZATION>. Plans for completing I-95 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> were scuttled in 1983. I-95 now runs through all or parts of 15 Eastern states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to <PERSON> Houlton </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. In parts of the heavily-traveled <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION>, I-95 often becomes a traffic nightmare. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, a state senator from <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, describes the situation on <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 95 </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> as `` absolutely horrendous.'' `` It's gridlock from 6:30 a.m. to after 8:30. A ride from <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION> that should take 25 minutes takes more than one hour, and if every aspect of mass transportation was used by the year 2000, we'd still have hopeless gridlock,'' <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> said. Work on the $ 222 million final leg in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> began in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> in February 1985 with money appropriated by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> three years before. The last link runs from northeastern <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> Martin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, loops west across the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Turnpike </LOCATION> and then meanders back toward the coast to connect with what used to be a dead-end stretch of the highway in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lucie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. During several years of construction, the then-incomplete portion of I-95 became a favorite runway for drug smugglers. `` It became the longest runway in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for drug smuggling planes,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Holt </PERSON>, the sheriff of <LOCATION> Martin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, said when the link was opened in December. In <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, Interstate 95 offers easy access to all of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> beaches and is little more than an hour away from <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> World </LOCATION> and many other <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> attractions. `` I did n't know whether I'd live long enough to see it complete or not,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>, of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>, who helped oversee work on the `` missing link.'' Some officials say completion of the section between <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lucie </LOCATION> counties in southeastern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> will open the <ORGANIZATION> Treasure </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> to commuter traffic from as far away as <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` You figure a two-hour commute to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> really is n't any worse than what some people do to get from one end of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to the other, or <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>,'' said <LOCATION> Martin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Maggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurchalla </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> <PERSON> deHaven-Smith </PERSON>, associate director of the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University-Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Study </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Problems </ORGANIZATION>, sees it as one more step in `` the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angelization </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>.''

<TEXT>
 Interstate 95, the 1,866-mile corridor that takes truckers, snowbirds and salesmen from <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, begins at the Canadian border in this far north potato town. Before reaching <LOCATION> Bangor </LOCATION>, the nearest big city, I-95 winds through miles of potato farms, brushes the <LOCATION> Haynesville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Woods </LOCATION> _ made famous by <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Curless </PERSON>' country and western hit, `` Tombstone Every Mile'' _ then passes through a strand of white birches before cutting through the brooding Argyle peat bog. Remote and isolated, the only access to points south before the opening of the two-lane highway in 1966 were state Routes 2 and 2A _ hilly, winding, treacherous roads, particularly in winter. Then the trip to <LOCATION> Bangor </LOCATION> could take up to four hours, and had to be a well-planned event. `` We would go only a couple times a year,'' recalls <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, 62, who has lived her entire life in this <LOCATION> Aroostook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> shiretown of 6,750. `` We'd leave early in the morning, do our shopping, have dinner and it was probably 10 o'clock at night before we were home. It was an all day thing, but it was grand fun.'' Today, the interstate is a four-lane highway and the speed limit 65 mph, which has cut the driving time to <LOCATION> Bangor </LOCATION> in half. `` It was a godsend as far as getting to the southern part of the state,'' lifelong area resident, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 50, said of the highway. `` The interstate ca n't be equalled in my opinion, anywhere.'' The opening of the interstate has increased traffic into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. When I-95 first opened _ two miles from the <LOCATION> Maine-New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION> border _ 4,900 people a month entered the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. By 1987, 273,000 people and 5,000 trucks a month were streaming into the country, according to <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> supervisor at the border checkpoint. The interstate, which cost $ 140 million to build from <LOCATION> Bangor </LOCATION> to <PERSON> Houlton </PERSON>, also created a new business district, forcing motels, restaurants and stores from downtown <PERSON> Houlton </PERSON> or Route 2A to close or move near the highway to accommodate the re-routed traffic. Some believe business has increased in <LOCATION> Houlton </LOCATION>, where the economy is based on the potato industry and the lumber trade. `` There seems to be more activity in <LOCATION> Houlton </LOCATION> than there has been in prior years,'' said <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, an insurance and real estate agent. `` Maybe that's just a gut feeling, but there seems to be more construction. I think development around an interstate seems to snowball.'' While the road has made access to southern <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> easier, life in <LOCATION> Houlton </LOCATION>, as one resident says, has n't changed much. `` It's just a long way from the rest of the world,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said. `` Even though you can get to <LOCATION> Bangor </LOCATION> in just under two hours, you still have a long way to go if you want to go to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>.''

<TEXT>
 Once called the Hermit Kingdom, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is preparing to entertain the world at the 1988 Olympic Games and show just how much things have changed. The country, which for centuries tried to seal itself off from the world, has been transformed in recent years into one of <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>'s most modern and fastest-growing nations Staging the Olympics is the crowning glory of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s economic rise. <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, a sprawling city of 10 million people, has been preparing for years to host the Games and ensure that everything is right when the Olympic spotlight turns on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> beginning Sept. 17. The city of high-rise buildings, broad avenues and meticulous neatness is dotted with Olympic flags and banners for the Games. The five interlocked circles, symbol of the Olympic movement, is stamped on everything from milk cartons and television logos to carriages in the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> subway system. `` The No. 1 games. The No. 1 people,'' proclaim the subway signs on every carriage door. Counters ticking off the days to the start of the games stand outside all government offices and police stations, in every subway station and in many shops and businesses. Some buildings even have little counters in the elevators. Newspapers are filled with articles on the Olympics, <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> taxi drivers are taking courses in English and other foreign languages, homeowners are being urged to provide accommodation for tourists, and hotels and new shops are under construction all over <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. The sprawling Olympic Park in the south of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, with its giant stadiums, tracks and pools, is ready for the Games. Workers scurry around the immaculate complex every day, polishing the stadiums and trimming lawns and trees. But visitors hoping to attend the Olympic Games had better already have firm hotel and airline reservations. Accommodation is likely to be scarce with more than 200,000 visitors expected. Visitors who want to get the real flavor of <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> should get off the main streeets and take a walk through the sidestreets and alleys that are usually just one block over. Street life in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> is colorful and entertaining. Little shops offer brightly colored quilts and basketwork, antique dealers sell old pottery and elaborate Korean chests. Stall holders are everywhere selling fruit, vegetables and flowers. Sidewalk vendors or little makeshift restraurants offer onion pancakes, rice noodles in red pepper sauce and jam and almond paste cakes, roast chestnuts and dried squid. Koreans like to socialize over food and drink and <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> is covered with thousands of restaurants, beer halls, tea rooms, snack counters and sidewalk vendors serving a vast range of dishes. Korean food offers distinctive spicy dishes such as pulgogi, a barbecued beef that is cooked at your table, and kalbi or barbecued beef ribs. Kimchi, fiery pickled cabbage that is the most famous dish in Korean cuisine, accompanies just about every meal. Another pleasure are the many small and inexpensive noodle and rice restaurants where a steaming bowl of fish or beef soup can be had with noodles or rice for $ 2 or $ 3. Many visitors enjoy sampling both local brews and Korean society by visiting Korean beerhalls, where local beers and a potent sorghum liquor called soju are served. Koreans love to sing and strangers and friends join in everything from country and western hits to haunting Korean love melodies. <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> has much to offer shoppers, with bargains in clothes, luggage, shoes and leather goods, porcelain, Oriental prints, fabric, and inexpensive jewelery. Several fur companies offer bargain fur coats that shoppers pick up at the airport on their way out. The city is covered with shops, department stores, arcades and markets. Many visitors head for the <LOCATION> Itaewon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION>, where English is widely spoken. More colorful are the vast open air markets at <LOCATION> Tongdaemun </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Namdaemun </ORGANIZATION> where vendors sell everything from sneakers and bolts of brilliantly colored silk to live carp and turtles for dinner. Foreign visitors invariably say language is the biggest problem they encounter. English and other foreign languages are not widely spoken. But Koreans will happily assist guests and smiles, nods and hand gestures are often sufficient. One problem confronting Olympic visitors will be very strict security that could make getting around difficult at times during the Games. The government, concerned about possible terrorist threats from rival communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, will deploy tens of thousands of troops and police to ensure the safety of the Games and the visitors.

 The <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> metropolitan government has established a Home-Stay Program involving 668 Korean families to cater to foreign tourists expected for the Olympic Games in September. Part of the preparation for the host homes involves learning Western-style cooking. `` The basic price of the Home-Stay Program -LRB- $ 25 a person per night -RRB- includes breakfast and, obviously, most Western visitors will not be used to the Korean-style morning meal of soup, fish, rice and kimchi -LRB- a spicy cabbage dish -RRB-,'' said a city government official. `` We want to be able to offer them the kind of breakfast dishes they are used to at home. That's no problem in our city's hotels _ but perhaps a new cooking experience for some Korean housewives.'' The homes in the program, which is operated by the <ORGANIZATION> Korea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, include traditional Korean-style houses and modern apartments.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Dolphins </ORGANIZATION>, their bodies luminous in the black sea, swam alongside the bow in the dark, moonless night, playfully racing our sailboat as it cut through the water on the second night of our trip to the <LOCATION> Galapagos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. A few hours later, they frolicked just outside the porthole of our cabin, waking us up with their high-pitched whistles, seemingly to watch their midnight antics. By then, we were hooked on the wonders of these fascinating islands, located some 600 miles off the coast of <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> and populated with strange and unusual birds, reptiles and animals. `` These islands are a unique entity, related to no other part of this planet,'' writes <PERSON> Tui </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> in her book, `` Galapagos: Islands Lost in Time.'' `` They contain mountains, forests, beaches and bays unlike any others on the earth,'' she said. `` Here animals and plants have evolved into unique forms; some have survived scarcely changed, from prehistoric times.'' Indeed, a visit to the islands _ there are 13 large ones and dozens of small ones and reefs spread over about 18,000 square miles _ is to go back in time. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Darwin </PERSON>, the English naturalist, visited the islands in 1835 aboard the ship Beagle. His observations were key in formulating the theory of evolution. In his book `` <PERSON> Darwin </PERSON> and the Beagle,'' <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Moorehead </PERSON> quotes <PERSON> Darwin </PERSON> as saying about the islands: `` Here, both in space and time, we seem to be brought somewhere near to that great fact _ that mystery of mysteries _ the first appearance of new beings on this earth.'' That sense of mystery remains. Gray-black swirls and coils left by flowing lava at the turn of this century, still virtually intact, stretch eerily as far as the eye can see at <LOCATION> Sullivan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. Marine iguanas, their heads like armored helmets shaped at the dawn of time, sun their grayish bodies on rocks at <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bay </PERSON>, also on <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. The giant tortoises _ the name <PERSON> Galapagos </PERSON> comes from the Spanish word for tortoise _ lumber across the landscape, much as their prehistoric ancestors did. They are the world's largest, a ranking shared only with a species on the <LOCATION> Seychelles </LOCATION>, the islands in the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. Sailing in a 48-foot yacht, we were able to visit six of the islands in five days and see a wide variety of animals, birds and reptiles in their natural habitat as well as hike over volcanic terrain. The trips are regulated by the <ORGANIZATION> Galapagos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which limits visitors to 26,000 a year. Tourists are restricted where they can walk so they do n't disturb the islands' ecology. We slept and ate aboard the yacht. Food was prepared by a cook who used local products to make such Ecuadorean specialties as a mashed potatoes and cheese dish called llapingachos, ceviche topped with popcorn, and desserts of sweet tomatoes. A guide approved by the park service traveled with us, pointing out blue-footed boobies, lava herons and swallow-tailed gulls by day and constellations by night. Never having been threatened by humans, the islands' creatures are extraordinarily tame. Nearly all were unfazed by our presence. Enormous colonies of sea lions, some swimming, others sparring and one even nursing a pup on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, let us walk gingerly among them without scurrying away. Some even turned the tables and inspected us. A young sea lion pulled himself out of a shallow pool at <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bay </PERSON> to get a closer look. With his tiny ears alert, he sniffed a friend's white jogging shoe before slithering away to dry off on a warm cliff. A tiny penguin darted around us, swimming as we snorkeled in beautifully clear water near <LOCATION> Pinnacle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Bartolome </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. A pelican, maybe hoping for some leftovers from our cook, perched atop the motor on the dinghy behind our yacht. A few creatures were decidedly unfriendly, and we were n't certain about the intentions of two sharks spotted circling one night when our becalmed yacht stalled for more than an hour during a long sail in the deserted waters between two islands The captain of our boat reassured us that <PERSON> Galapagos </PERSON> sharks were special, like the islands' other creatures. `` Vegetarians,'' he said with a big smile.

 Men and women with heavy loads on their backs trudge the roads of <LOCATION> Pokhara </LOCATION>. Some are trekkers _ Americans, Europeans, Australians _ going up into the mountains Others are <PERSON> Gurung </PERSON> tribesmen coming down with loads of cloth or grain. <LOCATION> Pokhara </LOCATION>, 124 miles west of <LOCATION> Katmandu </LOCATION>, owes its existence to the majestic sweep of half a dozen Himalayan peaks to the north. It calls itself `` Gateway to <PERSON> Annapurna </PERSON>,'' after the tallest at 26,504 feet. It is crowded with young tourists chattering about treks and older ones waiting hopefully for frequent clouds and mist to part for a glimpse of the snowy peaks. It was not always so. In fact, says retired British Col. J.O.M. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pokhara </LOCATION> was once one of the world's most isolated places. `` Anything you can see here, cut it down. It did n't exist,'' <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said, recalling his initial visit as one of the first Westerners into the <LOCATION> Pokhara </LOCATION> valley in 1950. <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> was closed to tourists until 1951, and the ony way to <LOCATION> Pokhara </LOCATION> was to walk. French climber <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON>, the first European to conquer a major Himalayan peak, bypassed the place en route to his conquest of Annapurna I on June 3, 1950. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said that on his second visit in 1957, he saw only an airstrip and a tree. Even the oxcart, ubiquitous in south <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, did not arrive in <LOCATION> Pokhara </LOCATION> until 1961, brought in by aircraft. Today, where only rocky paths existed, a string of villages makes up the town of <LOCATION> Pokhara </LOCATION>. Corrugated tin shops, thatch shacks and concrete-block houses have sprung up willy-nilly. About 70,000 people live in the area. Many are <PERSON> Gurungs </PERSON> or Mayars who came down from the hills to settle after seeing the outside world in the famed Gurkha regiments in which <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> also served. D.B. <PERSON> Thapa </PERSON> of the government tourist office said 70,000 visitors also come to <LOCATION> Pokhara </LOCATION> each year. But natives and foreigners rarely collide, since tribesmen do their business in the <LOCATION> Mahendra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pul </LOCATION> area north of the airport, and Westerners hang out near <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Phewa </LOCATION> to the west. At the native bazaar, most signs are in Nepali script, though the <ORGANIZATION> Shakva </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tailors </ORGANIZATION> advertises `` Satisfaction Is Our Garent.'' A search for books in English turns up only `` Basic Chemistry'' and similar texts. The lakeside, by contrast, is a bibliophile's dream: 16 bookstores can be found in a 15-minute walk, with titles in a half-dozen languages traded or sold by wandering readers. At one shop, the Bible in German shares a shelf with `` I'll Take Manhattan'' by <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Krantz </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tolstoy </PERSON>'s `` War and Peace,'' and `` Annapurna, Premier 8,000,'' <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON>'s tale of his conquest. Nearby are books on mountains and mysticism, along with Batik versions of the Tantric erotic art carved on <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>'s Hindu temples. The rest of the lakeside is a similar international jumble: the <ORGANIZATION> Amica </ORGANIZATION> German Hair Composer, Axis Steaks and Pizza, the Monsoon Restaurant _ Japanese food, and Tranquility Lodge offering `` harmony, peace and good energy.'' `` You can get a room in <LOCATION> Pokhara </LOCATION> from 15 rupees to 1,500 rupees,'' _ 70 cents to $ 70 dollars _ said <PERSON> Ranga </PERSON> <PERSON> Nath </PERSON> <PERSON> Timilshina </PERSON>, 19, who was hawking the <PERSON> Amrit </PERSON> <PERSON> Hotel </PERSON>, four rooms each with bath added to his family's lakeside home. A friend, 22-year-old <PERSON> Madabah </PERSON> <PERSON> Prasad </PERSON> <PERSON> Neupane </PERSON>, leaned on his bicycle and mused about changes since <LOCATION> Pokhara </LOCATION>'s hotel boom began in the late 1960s. `` People here used to be farmers. Now they find the hotel business is an easy way to get money,'' he said. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> grumbles about the `` concrete mess'' of today's <LOCATION> Pokhara </LOCATION>, but his trekking service here makes him part of the place. He even has a role in one supposed legend of the ersatz town. One guidebook relates how an expedition that <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> led in 1957 to climb 22,958-foot <PERSON> Macha </PERSON> <PERSON> Pucchare </PERSON> _ Fishtail Peak, the nearest to the town _ turned back because <LOCATION> Sherpa </LOCATION> guides feared the wrath of the `` mountain goddess.'' Not so, said <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>. The Sherpas had no superstitions, and it was two British climbers who were forced to quit about 150 feet from the top. `` We were beaten by the mountain,'' he said. `` It's still not been climbed,'' he added. `` It's nice to have something untouched.''

 <PERSON> Conner </PERSON> <PERSON> Prairie </PERSON>, one of the nation's most authentic 19th-century villages, is adding something new: a state-of-the-art, $ 10.5 million museum center The museum center will open May 7 with a two-day celebration. <LOCATION> Conner </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prairie </LOCATION>, six miles north of <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, depicts the lives, times, attitudes and values of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>'s first settlers. It stretches over 250 acres and attracts 200,000 visitors annually. `` You're in your own historical novel or personal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> movie,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Werner </PERSON>, who supervises the museum's documentation `` People who know nothing of the 1830s come out here and suddenly find themselves wrapped up in the history. We awaken people to the realities _ good and bad.'' The museum center will house a permanent gallery, temporary exhibition hall, audio-visual program, restaurant, 100-seat theater, library, classrooms and administrative offices. `` The center has been designed as a complement to the village,'' museum smokeswoman <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> says. `` It's a modern visitor's center meant to augment what's outside The village is real, so why imitate?'' Open since 1974, <PERSON> Conner </PERSON> <PERSON> Prairie </PERSON> features `` citizens'' interpreting everyday events from a 19th-century perspective. Visitors are encouraged to participate in hands-on activities as they circulate among the town's 30 authentic buildings. `` Kids can poke around and play here and that does n't happen at most historic sites,'' <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said. `` There are so many generic living history museums and ` no touch' places out there. That's what we want to avoid. `` We encourage active participation because we want visitors to get not only a sense of how people lived, but how they felt. How better to learn history?'' <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> said family members of all ages enjoy chatting with the more than 100 history interpreters at Conner Prairie and joining them in weaving, making soap, cooking, working with wood and playing pioneer games. `` You ca n't describe what the interpreters do as acting,'' said <PERSON> Werner </PERSON>, who also participates in the role-playing. `` It goes beyond acting. You're recreating social, political, cultural and emotional circumstances.'' He also underlined the museum's success in educating visitors _ in some cases _ despite themselves. `` People expect the typical history museum where everything is ` over there' and roped off,'' <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> said. `` But here, no one's lecturing you People's hesitancy breaks down and they become a part of the village. We impart factual knowledge without their knowing it.'' Evening concerts on the prairie, candlelight walks and hearthside suppers are among the special programs scheduled year-round at the museum. Families can also relive the pioneer experience by reserving a rustic cabin on the prairie or by attending horse races, weddings, funerals and political debates in the village. `` We generally have funerals in the fall, because that was the cholera season. We aim to make visitors feel and understand that these are real people, not just historic figures,'' <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said. `` Everything here has to be tried and true and confirmed by at least three sources.'' International pharmaceutical heir <PERSON> Eli </PERSON> <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON> originally purchased the property in 1934. With his wife, he restored the original <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Conner </PERSON> home, decorating it with period antiques before donating it and the surrounding farmland to <ORGANIZATION> Earlham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in 1964. <PERSON> Conner </PERSON>, a frontiersman, trader and statesman, was instrumental in developing central <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> during the early 19th century.

 `` Dixieland was a big cheaply constructed frame house of 18 or 20 drafty high-ceilinged rooms: it had a rambling, unplanned gabular appearance.'' In <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>'s autobiographical first novel, ` Look Homeward, <PERSON> Angel </PERSON>,'' `` Dixieland'' was the fictional name for the place called <ORGANIZATION> Old </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION>, a boarding house run by his mother in his birthplace of <LOCATION> Asheville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> moved into the boarding house when he was about 6 years old. `` The construction was after her own plans,'' <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> wrote of the house, `` and of the cheapest material: it never lost the smell of raw wood, cheap varnish and flimsy rough plastering.'' <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> -LRB- the <PERSON> Eliza </PERSON> of `` Look Homeward, Angel'' -RRB- bought the house in 1906 for $ 6,500. She renovated it, added rooms and a sun porch and rented to traveling salesmen, vaudeville performers, school teachers, and others. Her business cards advertised, `` Large Lawns, No Sick People, Rates Reasonable.'' <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> W.O. </PERSON>, refused to become a part of the enterprise and stayed at the old family home on <LOCATION> Woodfin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, now a YMCA. The boarders provided <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> with much material for his novels. `` Look Homeward, Angel'' shocked <LOCATION> Asheville </LOCATION> residents of the time, who objected to the unvarnished, thinly-disguised portraits of those in <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>'s fictional town of `` <LOCATION> Altamont </LOCATION>.'' The book was banned from the local <LOCATION> Asheville </LOCATION> library. But today, there's renewed interest in <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> _ the 1988 Pulitzer Prize for biography went to <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> for `` Look Homeward: A Life of <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>'' _ and <LOCATION> Asheville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, is saying you can go home again. The 28-room boarding house at 48 Spruce St. -LRB- Spring St. in <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>'s novel -RRB- is now a literary shrine, open to the public, with formal tours -LRB- $ 1 admission -RRB-. A `` Living History'' attraction is featured this May 14-15, with role players at the house wearing period costumes of 1916, the year <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Asheville </LOCATION> to attend the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chapel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. `` We try very hard to present the house and its inhabitants exactly as they were back then,'' says <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, site manager of the Wolfe Memorial. `` The costumes of the people playing the role of boarders are specially made to assure their authenticity. `` Once visitors enter the home, they will think they have taken a trip back in time to 1916. Even the music we play is from that time period.'' The house reflects the early 1900s with furnishings and many personal effects intact. An upstairs bedroom contains <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>'s belongings from his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> apartment, including clothing, a writing table and typewriter -LRB- which he never used, preferring to write in longhand -RRB- <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>, also the author of `` Of Time and the River'' and `` You Ca n't Go Home Again,'' among others, died in 1938. The 50th anniversary of his death will be marked with a special program at the home in September. In October, there will be an open house to commemorate his birthday. Another tourist site in the area is the <ORGANIZATION> Biltmore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanderbilt </PERSON> mansion built in <LOCATION> Asheville </LOCATION> in 1885 by architect <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> and landscape designer <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Law </PERSON> <PERSON> Olmsted </PERSON>.

 The consumer uprising by air travelers appears to be easing a bit as the 1988 summer travel season approaches. Complaints about airline service, though still coming into the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> at the rate of several thousand a month, have eased as airlines try to eliminate what irritates travelers the most. Under government pressure, the major air carriers have scheduled flights more realistically, eased the bunching of flights around busy travel times and funneled additional manpower and money into dealing with their customers. `` Much of the confusion and inconvenience is behind us now,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, vice president for public information at the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the airline trade group. <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> acknowledged past problems, but suggested in a recent speech that the airlines are determined to provide better service. <PERSON> Cornish </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitchcock </PERSON>, legal affairs director for the <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION>, a public interest group that keeps tabs on aviation issues and has been critical of the industry in the past, also suggests that perhaps the worst consumer problems in aviation may be over. At least, he says, there may not be `` the indifference to the plight of passengers'' that marked 1987 as far as many of the major air carriers were concerned. `` I'm not sure you can declare victory yet,'' said <PERSON> Hitchcock </PERSON> in an interview, adding that the test is likely to come as the busy summer travel season begins. For millions of people who travel by air, 1987 often became a nightmare. In June of last year, the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> received as many complaints about air travel as it had received in all of the previous five months. Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> began talking of re-regulating the industry and on more than one occasion unruly passengers stormed a ticket counter because a flight had been canceled or they faced long delays. The turmoil and pressure from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> caused the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to get tough with the airlines. They were told to stop scheduling flights unrealistically, knowing that delays would result. And in a major change the airlines were told beginning last September to make detailed reports to the government about their on-time performance as well as complaints about mishandled bags and problems with overbooking. After six months of such reports, it became clear that even in a good month about one-fifth of the flights by 14 major airlines are likely to be late. The airlines worst performance came last October when one-third of the flights were late. Today the on-time record of each flight can be provided by a travel agent or airline reservation clerk through the reservation computer. A code shows how often a flight has been on time in the previous month, although a customer normally must ask for the information. But travelers so far have not availed themselves to such information on a wide-scale basis, according to travel agents. Furthermore, some critics have argued that the information is of minimal value because often a traveler has little choice as to which flight to take to a particular city. Many members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> want more detailed consumer reporting by the airlines, but consumer legislation aimed at the airlines has been bogged down in a dispute over testing airline employes for drugs. Airline opposition is strongest to provisions in pending legislation that would require the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> as well as airlines to provide toll-free telephone lines for consumer complaints; provide free tickets for lost baggage; require that tickets be refundable; and require airlines to establish a minimum time for flights. These provisions if approved would force the cutback of service and harm consumers, the airlines have argued. Meanwhile, the airlines are not yet certain what _ if any _ problems will develop this summer from two new requirements from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. A new regulation that bans smoking on flights of two hours or less could unleash not only confrontations aboard aircraft but prompt a range of complaints about enforcement. Furthermore, neither the airlines nor travelers have gotten accustomed to carry-on baggage restrictions that went into effect at the beginning of the year. As the busy travel season begins both the smoking and baggage rules are likely to result in at least some friction, says <PERSON> Hitchcock </PERSON>.

 Groups that represent the handicapped are eagerly awaiting a <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> regulation _ expected within a few months _ that they hope will clarify their rights aboard commercial airliners. People who must use wheelchairs or are blind have complained for years that they are being discriminated against and often embarrassed when they travel by air. The battle lines between the handicapped and the airline industry have at times been tense. According to the National Federation of the Blind, there have been more than 20 blind people arrested and taken from aircraft because of disputes over seating or other issues. `` What the blind want most is simple, straightforward, uncomplicated and reasonable. We want to be left alone to buy our tickets and fly in peace,'' <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Mauer </PERSON>, president of the federation, told a government panel last September. The new regulations are expected to provide broad guidelines to the airlines on how they should accommodate the handicapped and also provide specific requirements. `` Once we get these regulations in draft form a lot of people will finally know what their rights are and the airlines will know what their obligations are. Things will be a lot clearer,'' says <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Capozzi </PERSON>, an official of the Paralyzed Veterans of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The regulations stem from the Air Carrier Access Act, enacted by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 to specifically guarantee the rights of the handicapped to have access to air travel without discrimination. <PERSON> Capozzi </PERSON>, who uses a wheelchair, said issues still to be resolved include: _ The question of where handicapped passengers should be allowed to sit. Federal regulations include no seating restrictions, although many airlines have policies that direct handicapped to be seated in certain sections of a plane. _ Should airlines be allowed to set a limit on the number of handicapped people to allow on a single flight? Airlines want to restrict such passengers to no more than the number of emergency exits on an aircraft. _ Should a handicapped traveler be required to be accompanied by an attendant? Advocacy groups for the handicapped argue that should be up to the traveler involved. The seating issue is among the most controversial. The airlines want the government to specifically exclude handicapped passengers from certain seats, such as the row next to an emergency exit. But groups representing the handicapped scoff at suggestions that a blind person might be a liability in such a location. They also say that if there is a restriction it should be limited to the door adjacent to the exit and not an entire row. Some airlines require the handicapped to be seated in specific seats in an aircraft. Recently, a blind passenger aboard a <ORGANIZATION> Midway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet was arrested when she refused to move from the smoking section at the rear of the plane to the first row close to an exit door. <PERSON> Capozzi </PERSON> said that the incident was an example of another problem facing the handicapped. `` They -LRB- the airlines -RRB- treat the disabled persn as a homogenized group. You need to look at the individual differences,'' he says. Travelers who are confined to wheelchairs, for example, like the first row of an airplane because of the easy access, but to a blind person that same requirement may not be irrelevant, he suggests.

 <PERSON> Shamu </PERSON>, <PERSON> Namu </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kandu </PERSON> are readying a killer of a sea show that organizers hope will fishtail with the <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION> and the city's <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Walk </LOCATION>. While the killer whales swim around in a 7 million gallon tank, gardeners are putting the final landscaping touches on Sea World of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, a $ 140 million, 250-acre facility billed as the nation's largest marine theme park The park's `` Big Splash'' opening is set for May 28, but workers, animals and trainers are already performing in rehearsals for visitors. Sea World, 13 miles northwest of downtown <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, will be open year-round. It is expected to employ 2,000 people during its peak summer season, generate a $ 25 million annual payroll and attract 3 million visitors bearing another $ 300 million yearly for the park's and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' economies. City and tourist industry officials have looked at <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> World </LOCATION> as a magnet for tourists to help the state diversify from its dependency on petroleum, but <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> warns against expecting too much too soon. `` I've cautioned a few people that we'll do the very best that we can, but not to rest on their laurels and expect us to be the end-all and the answer to all of their business problems,'' he said. Visitors can expect to see the park's star, <PERSON> Shamu </PERSON>, a two-ton killer whale that was among the fish and animals brought in from three other Sea World parks around the country. <PERSON> Shamu </PERSON> will perform in a 4,500-seat stadium. At other, smaller stadiums, dolphins, seals, sea lions, walruses and other animals will show their stuff, too. Skiers will perform acrobatics in a 12-acre lake, and visitors can walk across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> via a one-acre `` map'' of the country. There are restaurants, lounges, a disco for teen-agers and a playground for children. There also is Cypress Gardens West, a botanical center where a variety of flowers will bloom year-round. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> tourism already generates more than $ 1 billion annually, with lures like the <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Walk </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> is home to Six Flags of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> and to AstroWorld in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, both of which attract about 1.7 million visitors a year each. Tourist industry officials believe Sea World will help, not hurt, those amusement parks. `` It's actually going to help them because it completes the triangle of from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> area,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Todd </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tourist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. He said Sea World is following the lead of other tourist attractions by promoting <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> first and its location second. `` I do n't think tourism is a panacea, but it's all fresh, new money and it's an immediate boost to the economy and it's rapidly becoming one of our top industries,'' <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> said. `` We Texans had better face the fact that tourism is an industry whose time has come. We have sat back and been dependent on oil and agriculture and have n't needed tourism, and now all of a sudden we need it and we need to market <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> intelligently,'' he said. -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>'s one-day admission is $ 18.95 for adults and $ 15.95 for senior citizens -LRB- 55 and older -RRB- and children 3-11. A 12-month pass is $ 49 for adults and $ 39 for children. Founders Club pass, available until May 28, is $ 125 and offers special discounts and is good for admission through Dec. 31, 1991.

 As the well-known old <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> capital cities _ <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> _ slowly regain travel favor with Americans, `` <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>'s Hideaway Report'' provides a list of `` enchanting'' small hotels he describes as `` well-managed, personalized properties nestled in uniquely private settings. <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> is a pseudonym for the editor and publisher who travels the world incognito for a monthly newsletter directed primarily at top business executives with a median annual income of more than $ 200,000. His choices as `` 1987 Hideaways of the Year'' in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> include these country house hotels: _ Park Hotel Kenmare -LRB- <LOCATION> Kenmare </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> -RRB- _ <LOCATION> Chewton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Glen </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Milton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> -RRB- _ <LOCATION> Bodysgallen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Llandudno </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> -RRB- _ <ORGANIZATION> Arisaig </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Arisaig </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> -RRB- _ <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reserve </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beaulieu </LOCATION> -LRB- Beaulieu-sur-Mer, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> -RRB- _ Zurserhof -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Zurs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arlberg </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> -RRB- _ Falsled Kro -LRB- <LOCATION> Falsled </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> -RRB- _ Il <PERSON> Pellicano </PERSON> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Porto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ercole </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> -RRB- _ <PERSON> Wald </PERSON> and <PERSON> Schlosshotel </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedrichsruhe </PERSON> -LRB- near <LOCATION> Ohringen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB- _ <ORGANIZATION> Pousada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> da </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rainha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Isabel </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Estremaz </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> -RRB- Two `` urban sanctuaries'' listed by <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> as best small hotels are The Plaza in <LOCATION> Copenhagen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, and the Hotel de Orangerie in <LOCATION> Bruges </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>. His selections, he says, are based on service, charm, comfort, decor, food and `` the intangible Q factor that separates the good from the truly enchanting.'' <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>, who promotes his newsletter as `` a connoisseur's guide to peaceful and unspoiled places,'' limits his circulation to about 15,000 and carries no advertising. He says his subscribers are willing to pay a premium `` to get away from other people in a very crowded world.'' In 1987, more than 6 million Americans visited <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, about 18 percent more than the previous year, according to the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. ETC said it was the second best year ever for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> travel to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, topped only by the 6.4 million total of 1985. The 23 member countries of the commission forecast 1988 traffic slightly ahead of last year, despite the decline of the dollar overseas.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Soho </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Bohemian </LOCATION> neighborhood famed for its smorgasbord of restaurants and expensive, tourist-oriented topless bars, is cleaning up its naughty image. Families are moving back to the once seedy half-mile square area of central <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> that was originally settled by immigrants and refugees. Trendy restaurants, wine bars and media companies are moving next door to generations-old firms of tailors, silversmiths and clockmakers, reclaiming the classic Georgian buildings from what was collectively known as `` the vice.'' Part of <LOCATION> Soho </LOCATION> has become the capital's <LOCATION> Chinatown </LOCATION>, with <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Street </PERSON> converted into a busy mall lined with <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> restaurants, supermarkets, bookstores and pay phones with pagoda-style roofs. The impetus for change came from <LOCATION> Soho </LOCATION>'s residents who were tired of gazing out their windows at pulsating pink neon signs boasting `` Girls, Girls, Girls,'' and of having to slink past peep shows, pornographic cinemas, lingerie shops and topless bars every time they took their children to school or shopped for groceries. `` The local community realized that it was them or us,'' explained <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Burrough </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Soho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. `` And we wanted to make sure it was us.'' <PERSON> Soho </PERSON> became synonymous with sleaze during World War II when <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers swarmed to its clubs and pubs. But <PERSON> Burrough </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Soho </LOCATION> did n't hit rock bottom until the mid-1970s. `` Prior to the mid-1960s, ` the vice' was represented in the main by prostitutes who were fairly unnoticeable,'' he said. `` In the 1970s it became sex cinemas, topless encounter bars, all sorts of things totally outside the provisions of the law. So ordinary, legitimate businesses were being pushed out.'' The 1,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Soho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> was founded in 1972 as a community group, and one of first accomplishments was to have <ORGANIZATION> Soho </ORGANIZATION> declared a conservation area, meaning nothing can be demolished without permission from the Westminster borough council. Westminster then passed tougher laws to regulate the flesh trade. The borough set aside just 10 licenses for sex shops, and a spokeswoman says only five were actually issued, all to book and video stores. <PERSON> Burrough </PERSON> said about 20 more sex shops still operate illegally, compared with a decade ago when 185 Soho buildings were devoted to the sex industry. He said 18 such buildings were on Greek Street alone, but now its four short blocks are home to 18 restaurants, three pubs, two sandwich bars, a patisserie, and only one sex shop. <LOCATION> Soho </LOCATION>, in the heart of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> End </LOCATION> <LOCATION> theater </LOCATION> <LOCATION> district </LOCATION>, is bounded by <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Regent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Charing </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cross </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Leicester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>. The name is thought to come from the ancient hare-hunting cry, `` So-Ho.'' The area's cosmopolitan flavor dates back to its first immigrants, French Protestants known as Huguenots who arrived in the late 1600s. Germans and Italians, many of them cooks and waiters, arrived in the 1860s and 1870s, followed by Polish and Russian Jews, many of them tailors, in the 1890s. Joining the melting pot were families from almost every other European country as well as <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> colonies past and present, Indians and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> Chinese. In the 1960s a favorite <LOCATION> Soho </LOCATION> haunt was Carnaby Street, with its swinging fashion shops stocked with bellbottoms, go-go boots, miniskirts and fishnet stockings. Today, <LOCATION> Soho </LOCATION>'s nooks and crannies are still packed with old established family businesses. Here the Savile Row tailors have their workshops, and gold lace is handmade for Buckingham Palace's livery Sprinkled among them are dozens of new film production and distribution offices, film laboratories, advertising agencies and other support services for <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s TV and cinema industry. Street for street, <LOCATION> Soho </LOCATION> is said to have more restaurants than any other part of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, ranging from Japanese sushi bars to a 1950s-style chrome and formica diner. Gourmets and gourmands can wallow in a cheese shop offering 200 varieties including car-tire-sized wheels of Swiss emmenthal. A coffee shop sells 25 types of fresh, aromatic beans, and barbecued ducks hang in Chinese markets.

 Take the train: That's the message of railroads all over <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Their lures include rail passes and reduced rates, tours sponsored by the railroads or by companies using rail transportation, and ride-a-bit, drive-a-bit arrangements covering trains and cars. Railroads have taken into account that a person may not want to ride the rails continuously, day after day, and yet wants full money's worth from his pass. So some offer passes that are good for perhaps nine days of train travel within a 21-day period or 16 days within a month, or other combinations. Eurail's Flexipass and the French Railpass fall into this category. The Flexipass is one of Eurail's four types of passes, all first class and covering 16 countries from <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, but not <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. For that, one would want the first class or economy class BritRail pass. Eurail, BritRail and the <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> Railpass all must be purchased outside the countries concerned. Travelers seeking to concentrate on a given region might look into the Scandinavian Rail Pass, covering <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and sold in the Scandinavian countries, or the <ORGANIZATION> Benelux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tourrail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pass </ORGANIZATION>, covering <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> and sold only in those countries. The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> also lists more than a dozen countries that have their own passes. They include <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> -LRB- B.T.L.C. Pass -RRB-, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> -LRB- Rambler -RRB-, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> -LRB- Austrian Network Pass -RRB-, and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> -LRB- Swiss Holiday Card -RRB-. A number of countries also offer discounts of up to 50 percent for senior citizens or sell half-fare cards entitling a traveler to half-fare on all train travel for a given period. On this side of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> has its All Aboard <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> fares, enabling people to take the train to any destination within one region of the country for a set roundtrip price, within two regions for a bit more and across the entire country for still another set price. One intermediate stop is allowed each way. <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> also offers a $ 7 Return Fare under which the purchaser of a one-way ticket in many cases can get the return trip for only $ 7. On regular <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> fares, seniors get a discount. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s railroad system, Via, has a Canrailpass and a Youthrailpass, which can be purchased in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, and senior citizens get one-third off regular fares. In <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, there are first-class and ordinary rail passes _ and a new undersea tunnel, more than 33 miles, linking the main island of <LOCATION> Honshu </LOCATION> with Hokkaido to the north. In many countries, passes also carry such perks as cut-rate entry to places of interest or free travel on city buses or subways. This is just a glimpse along the tracks. Railroads urge travelers to consider all the options before they make a choice. Sometimes a senior discount, for instance, or a one-time payment for half-fare privileges might be a bigger bargain than a pass. Many Americans, unused to trains, may feel lost without a car. The railroads have the answer: a car waiting at the station. Explore the countryside, return the car, and board the train again for the next destination _ and the next car. Eurail users can even leave the car involved in another country in some cases. For travelers who do n't want to lift a finger, there are tours by rail: <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s famed Copper Canyon with its 37 bridges and 86 tunnels; <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> coast-to-coast; a nostalgic trip on the <ORGANIZATION> Orient </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Istanbul </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. You name it. The less ambitious can take one-day excursions _ from <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> to the chateau country, or <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to Bath, Stonehenge and <PERSON> Salisbury </PERSON>, for instance. Tours take care of luggage, hotels, many meals, sightseeing and escorts to tell one what it's all about and leap the language barrier.

 What's in a name? Plenty, if it happens to be Spa, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>. For that town in the eastern Ardennes with its healing waters has given its name worldwide to the spots where people go to feel better, shape up physically, unknot their tensions, shed excess pounds and be pampered with manicures, pedicures, facials, hair-styling and the like. Spa, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, was mentioned by the Roman Pliny the Elder in the first century A.D., it is believed. In the Middle Ages, its healing waters began to be exploited. Beginning in about the 16th century, royalty including <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Navarre </LOCATION>, Queen <PERSON> Christina </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> the Great of <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> and Austrian Emperor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> frequented the resort. It is still there, catering not only to those who seek a `` cure,'' but to those who just want a pleasant vacation, with golf, riding, fishing, tennis, a casino, concerts, a nearby racetrack and parachute jumping exhibits at a nearby airfield. From <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, people are going to spas _ all kinds of spas. Spa-Finders, which puts out a spa catalogue and also uses a computer to help match people with the right spa for them, lists eight major categories. They include classic fitness spas that combine exercise, diet and relaxation in fairly equal proportions; spas that specialize in behavior modification; those that feature mineral springs, and holistic spas. The holistic spas are often vegetarian and offer such Eastern practices as yoga and <PERSON> Siatsu </PERSON> massage. Spas have a vocabulary of their own _ including <PERSON> Siatsu </PERSON>, which is a Japanese method of massage that follows the patterns used in acupuncture. A person can become involved with a Scotch hose, Swiss shower, salt glo, polarity, reflexology, thalassotherapy _ or sit it out in a Roman bath, a heated sea-water jacuzzi with benches. The average person pedaling an exercise bike and swimming laps at the `` Y'' may think spas are not for her or him. Too expensive. Not so, say the spa people, who say you can find some costing only a few hundred dollars a week per person. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vollmer </PERSON>, in `` Affordable Spas & amp; Fitness Resorts,'' says nearly 90 percent of spas now operating in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> cost less than $ 1,000 a week, and some are priced in the $ 400 to $ 500 range. Some are advertised for even less: Spend a week at a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> retreat that emphasizes stress-reduction by massage, yoga, meditation, long walks in the woods, sunbathing and swimming, for instance. Or you can get spruced up at a resort hotel and spa in the <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hot </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park-Ouachita </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> area. In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, one is invited to bathe in hot springs at temperatures of 98 to 120 degrees at a kerosene-lit hotel on ground that was considered sacred for healing by the Indians. Bring your own food and cook it on a country stove. All these places are under $ 400. At the other end of the price list are such establishments as <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s Golden Door, whose fans insist it's worth every bit of the more than $ 3,000 one will spend for a week's hospitality. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> of </PERSON> <PERSON> Spa-Finders </PERSON> has found that the spa market is a <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> one. If Americans go abroad, he says, it's usually to well-known resorts such as Montecatini in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Baden-Baden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, or <LOCATION> Baden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. But there are bargains waiting all over <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and other countries - including <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Island </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Danube </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, the Greek island of Kos, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> _ and <ORGANIZATION> Spa </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>.

 For some vacationers, cruising down the river means viewing castles on the <LOCATION> Rhine </LOCATION>, Egyptian monuments along the Nile or jungle foliage on the banks of the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION>. But Americans with a sense of history who prefer traveling closer to home will find several offbeat programs offered this season by tour operators emphasizing the nation's heritage. They include a package tour for vacationers lured by the call of the wild to <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> London </PERSON> country, a sail down the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawrence </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> where American patriots skirmished with British redcoats, and the exploration of rivers once crowded with Union and Confederate gunboats. `` To the pioneers, the rivers were the interstate highways of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' says <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Biesterfeld </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cruises </ORGANIZATION>, an Illinois-based company that specializes in travel programs focusing on North American history and heritage. According to <LOCATION> Biesterfeld </LOCATION>, the cruises will be using a variety of boats and ships ranging from historic paddlewheel steamboats to sleek river cruisers, and will be combined with land tours `` that enable the traveler to delve even deeper into the history of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' Offerings this year include a two-week excursion through <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> London </PERSON> territory that follows the footsteps of the early gold miners and sourdoughs of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and the Yukon, with stops at <LOCATION> Dawson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Whitehorse </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Skagway </LOCATION>. Another program is a 10-day `` Cruise to the Mountains'' combining a trip on the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> Queen steamboat from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> along the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> rivers with a tour of the Great Smoky Mountains. There also is an eight-day program tracing the trail of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> gold rush `` 49ers'' on the <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joaquin </LOCATION> rivers, with a motorcoach tour of the rugged <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coast from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> through the Big Sur to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, ending with a two-day stay aboard the Queen <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>. `` <ORGANIZATION> Hudson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION>'' is a nine-day tour highlighting the maritime history of the East Coast, including cruises on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION>, and on the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> rivers, plus visits to Sleepy Hollow and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>. Farther afield, another tour operator, New York-based Special Expeditions, <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, has scheduled an offbeat 27-day August voyage called `` Impressions of an Arctic Summer.'' The voyage aboard the 80-passenger ship `` M.S. Polaris'' begins in <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION> and ends in <LOCATION> Halifax </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scotia </LOCATION>. Points in between include <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Baffin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Labrador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION>. Plans call for visits to <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> the Red's Viking settlement at <LOCATION> Narsarsuaq </LOCATION>, which dates back to 982 A.D., and several Eskimo villages. Polar bears inhabit the pack ice, and seabird colonies abound. Other unusual programs beckoning travelers to faraway places this summer include one-week cruises aboard a 16-passenger wooden schooner modeled after a Greek pirate ship. The schooner `` Andromeda'' departs from <LOCATION> Piraeus </LOCATION>, the port for <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, every Saturday with a crew of five to visit 15 Greek islands. The itinerary includes a call at the port of <LOCATION> Gerakas </LOCATION>, once a departure point for infamous pirate ships; the island of <LOCATION> Hydra </LOCATION>, where cars are prohibited and donkeys provide the primary means of transportation, and a picturesque cove on <LOCATION> Spetsopoula </LOCATION>, an island privately owned by Greek shipping tycoon <PERSON> Stavros </PERSON> <PERSON> Niarchos </PERSON>. `` Sailing around the Greek isles on a pirate ship may sound like an unaffordable luxury, but in truth it does n't have to be,'' says <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION> Vacation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, a Chicago-based tour operator `` In addition to being one of the world's most beautiful destinations, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> happens to be among today's best vacation values.'' But the biggest news _ literally _ in the maritime travel business this year is the launching of what is billed as the largest cruise ship ever built, `` Sovereign of the Seas,'' a 74,000-ton, $ 185 million vessel which can accommodate more than 2,200 passengers. The ship has 12 passenger decks and is measures 874 feet from stem to stern, nearly the length of three football fields placed end-to-end. For those who simply love the idea of a cruise _ without necessarily going anywhere _ there's the <ORGANIZATION> Chakiris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fantasy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cruise </ORGANIZATION>, a weekend trip to virtually nowhere. It leaves <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on a Friday night and goes down the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> outside the harbor into the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> until it returns Sunday afternoon.

 Ripoffs and muggings of foreign tourists are giving Rio an image problem, and the government _ discreetly _ is trying to persuaded `` gringos'' to skip this famous city and visit other parts of vast <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. `` There's only one trouble spot for tourists in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, and that's <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> Doria </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Embratur </ORGANIZATION>, the federal government tourist board, told The <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>. Police figures are imprecise, but almost every day Rio newspapers carry stories of Americans, Europeans and even Latins from the Spanish-speaking part of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> complaining of 1,000 percent jackups of taxi fares, thefts of cameras and wallets from beaches and hotel rooms, and even outright stickups, sometimes by armed robbers. A federal government poster at <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>'s international airport shows a doll-like figure wearing shorts and a flowery shirt, with a camera around its neck. Written below in big letters is: `` Respeite o Turista,'' or `` Respect the Tourist'' in <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s language <ORGANIZATION> Embratur </ORGANIZATION>'s official line is that <PERSON> Rio </PERSON> is still a great place. But meanwhile, the agency is trying to make it easier for foreigners to visit other parts of the country. Many foreigners do n't realize that <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> is bigger in area than the 48 contiguous <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and tropical beach cities such as <LOCATION> Recife </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Natal </ORGANIZATION> at the country's northeastern tip and the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> jungle gateway of Manaus are thousands of miles closer to the Northern Hemisphere than <PERSON> Rio </PERSON> is. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Varig </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> has a daily nonstop run from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>. But one extra flight on that route stops weekly in <LOCATION> Manaus </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Embratur </ORGANIZATION> has begun a program of `` ecological tourism'' aimed at the appreciation for and preservation of the remarkable flora and fauna along the tributaries of the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Varig </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Portugal </ORGANIZATION> now include <LOCATION> Recife </LOCATION>, with its miles of palm-fringed, balmy beaches and precious Portuguese colonial architecture, on some of their European flights. `` We want to increase airline competition to Brazilian entry points that are not now generally well known,'' <PERSON> Doria </PERSON> said. `` The goal is to reduce air fares and attract more visitors.'' Despite its climate, scenery, music and cheap currency, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> attracts just 1 percent of world tourism. And of the 2 million annual visitors, most come from neighboring <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>, with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in third place, followed by <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` Because <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> is a poor country, surrounded by poor countries, in the far-off <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>, it will never compete with places such as <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> for international tourism,'' <PERSON> Doria </PERSON> said. `` But we do think realistically we can get our share up to 3 percent.'' But <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s own typical Latin bureaucracy often gets in the way of tourism objectives. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, which determines international airline routes, has been reluctant to promote unrestricted air competition. `` The ministry has been, let us say, conservative in this area, but still we are making progress,'' <PERSON> Doria </PERSON> said. `` Five years ago, no charter flights were permitted in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. Today we have them every week from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s Foreign Relations Ministry often makes foreign tourists obtain a visa before they can come to brazil. The standard is reciprocity: If a foreign country requires a visa for Brazilians, then citizens of that country must get a visa for <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. `` Sometimes what sounds right diplomatically does n't make sense economically,'' <PERSON> Doria </PERSON> said of the visa policy. `` Take the case of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, which recently instituted visas for <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, because some Brazilian tourists were caught working there illegally. So now Canadians need visas to visit <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. But I ca n't imagine many Canadians seeking to work illegally in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>.'' `` Our own government's countermeasures was not in our country's best interests, financially speaking,'' <PERSON> Doria </PERSON> said

 `` Wednesday 3 June 1863. `` Cloudy weather dominated the skies along the <LOCATION> Rappahannock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Fredericksburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. It rained somewhat in the morning.'' It was on that day that the <LOCATION> Gettysburg </LOCATION> campaign of the Civil War began with the <ORGANIZATION> Confederate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> starting its march toward <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, as Gen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> `` commenced to draw the army from the vicinity of <LOCATION> Fredericksburg </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> realized some of his army's deficiencies, yet wrote to his wife: `` I trust that a kind Providence will watch over us, and notwithstanding our weakness and sins will yet give us a name and place among the nations of the earth.'' The excerpts are from a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> daybook of the campaign, part of the national commemoration of the 125th anniversary of the key battle at the <LOCATION> Gettysburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, National Military Park. The commemoration begins Memorial Day, May 30. A `` Living History Encampment'' starts June 18 on a farm outside <LOCATION> Gettysburg </LOCATION>, when more than 1,000 re-enactors will organize an encampment and simulate the battle, firing blanks from original and authentic-looking Civil War guns and cannons. It will culminate in three days in July with a re-creation of the conflict that became the `` high water mark of the Confederacy.'' On July 1, 1863, the <ORGANIZATION> Confederate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virgina </ORGANIZATION> pushed the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Potomac </ORGANIZATION> from its positions north and west of the town to its final defense line, to sites like <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Round </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Top </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cemetery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, Devil's <PERSON> Den </PERSON>, <PERSON> Culp </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, <PERSON> Spangler </PERSON>'s Spring. Col. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickett </PERSON>'s charge, a frontal assault on July 3, sent 12,000 Confederate soldiers toward the Union line. Less than 4,000 returned. On July 4, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s army withdrew, never to return to the North. Some 160,000 soldiers took part in that battle 125 years ago; there were some 50,000 casualties.

 Hotels are going up so fast at <LOCATION> Playa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dorada </LOCATION> resort that golf vistas include half-built buildings as well as palm trees, and sunbathers have to walk past construction workers and cement mixers to get to the beach. Fresh water and electricity are in short supply, and the romantic candles guests find in their rooms really are there to tide them through blackouts. But never mind. Tourists drawn by white sand beaches, warm winter breezes and bargain prices are flocking to this Spanish-speaking nation and making it the most popular <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> destination after Puerto Rico and the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>. Tourism Minister <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Rainieri </PERSON> says, `` I hope to make the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> the tourism Mecca of the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> before 1990.'' Just a few years ago, such an expectation would have seemed hopelessly optimistic. In 1979, there were only 3,400 hotel rooms in the whole country, direct flights were few and marketing efforts haphazard. Today, resorts like <LOCATION> Puerta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plata </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Romana </ORGANIZATION> are as well known as <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Montego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>. Visitor arrivals jumped 21 percent to 791,380 last year, and are up 60 percent this decade. Hotel capacity has soared to 12,000 rooms and is expected to reach 23,000 in time for the 1991 winter season. The boom is the result of increased promotional efforts, a favorable exchange rate _ the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar that bought 1 peso four years ago now buys more than 5 _ and generous financial incentives for investors. Airlines increased seats by 50 percent in 1987, <PERSON> Rainieri </PERSON> said, and plan to do the same this year. The industry is the brightest spot in an economy where one of every two workers is jobless or only marginally employed, and one in four lives below the poverty line. Tourism has created 40,000 direct and 100,000 indirect jobs, many paying several times the minimum wage of $ 70 a month. Most new construction is taking place on the north coast, a sun-drenched strip of beaches wedged between a mountain ridge and the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> that seems a world removed from the crowded, impoverished capital <ORGANIZATION> Santo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Domingo </ORGANIZATION>, located on the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> coast four hours away by car. The Playa Dorada resort, built on a sugar cane field, has eight hotels with 150 to 400 rooms each. Four more are under construction and another four are in the planning stage. The town of <LOCATION> Sosua </LOCATION> 10 miles to the east was a sleepy dairy community five years ago. Now, 30 hotels are under construction, dairy farms are being sold to developers and land prices have skyrocketed. A similar boom in tourism and construction is taking place in the rest of the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, where the number of visitors topped 9 million for the first time last year _ up 12 percent from 1986. <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and other places have undertaken major construction programs, and estimates on the number of rooms being built right now range up to 20,000. That concerns some tourism officials, who wonder where the tourists will come from to fill all the rooms. After two record years in a row, the number of visitors to the region this year is likely to stabilize at 1987 levels.

 American business will spend more than $ 100 billion on travel and entertainment by 1990, according to an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> survey of business travel management. By comparison, an estimated $ 85 billion was spent in 1986, which <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> says is one-third more than business paid in taxes. The travel expense figure was $ 2 billion in 1985. Nearly 2,500 companies were surveyed and 28 percent responded, says <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>. According to the survey, air travel accounted for the largest portion of the travel and entertainment expenses, 41 percent of every travel dollar. Lodging -LRB- 22 percent -RRB- and meals -LRB- 17 percent -RRB- were next highest, followed by entertainment -LRB- 14 percent -RRB- and car -LRB- 6 percent -RRB-. In the future, competition for business customers will focus on quality of service, according to <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. `` The competition for business customers is going to be won on quality of service, not price, as travel vendors respond to a high level of consumer discontent and focus on service issues,'' said <PERSON> Tomasso </PERSON> <PERSON> Zanzotto </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, in a 1988 business travel forecast. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Froehlich </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, says, `` There's a definite interest in delivering high quality service to companies and their travelers. We understand that quality is directly related to our success.'' A recent booklet from the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agents </ORGANIZATION>, a trade association, reminded customers to plan ahead and ask questions of their travel agents: What is included in the price? What restrictions apply on discounted fare travel? What about passports and foreign currency? Travelmasters, a Chicago-based agency, is among those who have created information services to help customers make decisions. The agency has a Travel Line for special and last minute details for leisure travel customers and Fare Update, a monthly newsletter for corporate travelers and a Travelmaster Market Pack, containing travel costs, tour information, maps and weather information. `` As our business has become more computerized,'' says agency executive <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Blitz </PERSON>, `` it's more important than ever that we give meaningful service to each other.'' In another report, <ORGANIZATION> Runzheimer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said business travel prices rose sharply during 1987, increasing by 16.5 percent over the previous year. <ORGANIZATION> Runzheimer </ORGANIZATION> is a consulting firm based in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION> `` The reason for the big increase is due mostly to rising costs in air travel,'' said <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Burris </PERSON>, executive vice president. `` The airlines tightened restrictions for travelers in 1987, making discount fares less available than in the past. Therefore, business travelers had difficulty fitting their schedules around the available low fare flights. Air fares rose 30.5 percent during the year, according to <ORGANIZATION> Runzheimer </ORGANIZATION>.

 A proposal by two of the nation's biggest cable television concerns to pay about $ 1.55 billion for the cable systems of the former <ORGANIZATION> Storer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> follows a bigger consortium's abortive proposal to buy the properties at a higher price. <ORGANIZATION> Comcast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Tele-Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> announced Sunday they had a definitive agreement to acquire <ORGANIZATION> SCI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION>, the company formed when <PERSON> Storer </PERSON> was taken private by the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> in a $ 2.5 billion leveraged buyout in 1985. SCI last year sold its six television stations for about $ 1.4 billion, leaving it with cable television systems serving about 1.48 million subscribers in 12 states in the East and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>. The acquisition is subject to regulatory approval and other conditions. <ORGANIZATION> Comcast </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Tele-Communications </ORGANIZATION> both members of the consortium that proposed and later dropped a plan to acquire SCI for about $ 2.9 billion earlier this year. <ORGANIZATION> SCI </ORGANIZATION> said in December it had gotten a letter of intent for the acquisition by the consortium, which included <ORGANIZATION> Comcast </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which is owned by <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Taft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, a partnership of <ORGANIZATION> Tele-Communications </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bass </PERSON>. That proposal was for an acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> SCI </ORGANIZATION>'s 212 million common shares at between $ 9.25 and $ 9.75 apiece, plus the acquisition of preferred stock and $ 2.4 billion in debt. But the deal fell through in February when the consortium attempted to cut the purchase price. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Malone </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Tele-Communications </ORGANIZATION>, contended that <ORGANIZATION> SCI </ORGANIZATION> had made inaccurate representations that were disclosed during the course of the deal, prompting the group to seek a price reduction. <ORGANIZATION> Comcast </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Tele-Communications </ORGANIZATION> did not provide details of the proposed acquisition in a news release, and telephone calls Sunday to spokespeople at <ORGANIZATION> Comcast </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Bala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cynwyd </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Tele-Communications </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> were unanswered. SCI offices in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> were closed Sunday. SCI did state that it estimated the purchase price would mean a payment of between $ 4 and $ 4.50 for each outstanding warrant of SCI. <ORGANIZATION> Comcast </ORGANIZATION> operates cable systems serving about 1.35 million subscribers plus Muzak franchises. The company also owns <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cellular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which operates cellular telephone systems in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Comcast </ORGANIZATION> posted a net loss of $ 9.4 million in its 1987 fiscal year, compared with a 1986 profit of $ 1 million, or 3 cents a share, due to the costs of financing several acquisitions and to accounting factors. Revenue rose to $ 309.2 million from $ 130.8 million. <ORGANIZATION> Tele-Communications </ORGANIZATION> owns or controls cable systems serving about six million subscribers, according to industry estimates. It also owns a 52 percent stake in the operations of the newly merged <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which has interests in cable television and movie theaters. <ORGANIZATION> Tele-Communications </ORGANIZATION> posted a profit of $ 5.6 million, or 4 cents a share, in its 1987 fiscal year, down from $ 72.3 million, or 48 cents a share, the previous year. Its revenue rose to $ 1.7 billion from $ 645.7 million. The company blamed the earnings decline on the costs of financing its acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and costs related to its investment in <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION>. The profit figures included one-time gains of $ 42.4 million in 1987 and $ 165 million in 1986 from asset sales, and a charge of $ 22.5 million in 1986 from settlement of litigation.

 Few high-technology products are as unwanted as used computers, and thousands are junked each year in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But now more than $ 1 million worth of these high-tech hand-me-downs are headed from <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to the Third World. Since setting up formally in March, the <ORGANIZATION> Global </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> has received pledges of computer donations worth that much, and drawn requests for equipment from as far as <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, said one of the founders, <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>. With the accelerated pace of innovations in research and technology, a computer generation can last as little as two or three years in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. After that, obsolescence sets in. Thousands of outdated computers are stacked in warehouses gathering dust. Thousands more are crushed or melted down. Still others are cannibalized for spare parts. Upset with the waste, <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> and two friends in <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, decided to set up a clearinghouse for diverting the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> computer glut to developing countries in the Third World. Computer experts, American businessmen and Third World specialists laud the idea. `` For users in the Third World, this could leapfrog them into the 80s,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Curley </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> PC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Distributing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` I have never been able to bring myself to throw out perfectly good equipment. This concept is very exciting to us,'' said <PERSON> Curley </PERSON>, whose Illinois-based company is one of the largest computer distributors in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. He estimated that his company's donations could amount to about $ 100,000 annually in used computer hardware. For computer businesses, the donations are financially beneficial: they are a tax deduction and can save thousands of dollars in storage costs, said <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>. Global Technology is asking donors to include manuals with the computers and hopes to put together training packages including literature and experts for the Third World users. `` We're not just going to dump the stuff and leave them to figure it out,'' said <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>. Global Technology has received the tax-exempt status of a charitable foundation and has applied to several foundations for grants to fund transportation for the donations and management of its projects, he said. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaile </PERSON>, a geographer who serves on the foundation's advisory board, has worked on a separate project to introduce computers to government service in <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gaile </PERSON>, who teaches at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>, said Kenyans were `` thrilled with the computers. It gave them a rare skill in that society.'' He said the Kenyan government used to compile its budget manually, and was almost through the budget year before the document was completed. With computers, the budget is on time, <PERSON> Gaile </PERSON> said. `` Here, it's difficult to dump old computers. There, where they're 10 or 15 years behind, these machines are more than adequate,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> YMCA </ORGANIZATION> is one of the first in line to receive Global Technology's free computers. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Diamond </PERSON>, assistant director of the organization's International Division, said most of the YMCAs in 92 countries run themselves without computers. `` This would give them a tremendous chance to improve their management,'' he said. Computers would also be useful for the YMCAs' vocational training and remedial programs in <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> countries, he said. Computer corporations do contribute some surplus equipment overseas. But most of the computers go to specific government or university projects, but the emphasis is on supplying training experts rather than equipment. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, for example, is contributing to 200 projects overseas for disaster preparedness planning, soil reclamation, public health and other programs, said a company public affairs official, <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Nardin </PERSON>. But most of <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s contributionconsists of supplying professional advice, she added. Global Technology is also collecting medical and dental equipment, agricultural machinery, construction machinery, telephone equipment, water testing and purification devices. Even sewing machines are welcome.

 Textile giant <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stevens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, target of a protracted takeover battle, has accepted a $ 1.2 billion cash offer from two buyers after initially rejecting the deal, the companies involved said today. The $ 68.50-a-share deal will split up the 175-year-old fabric maker, one of the nation's largest textile producers and an important employer in the southeastern <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The major buyer is rival textile producer <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Point </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which will keep most of <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' sheet and towel operations but sell some to another textile producer, <ORGANIZATION> Bibb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Macon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, to satisfy previously announced federal antitrust concerns. <ORGANIZATION> Odyssey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, a Wall Street investment firm that had been vying with <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> to buy <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, will get the company's other operations, including its carpet and industrial fabrics plants, for about $ 530 million. <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Odyssey </PERSON> arranged the purchase with <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> after an initial $ 1.2 billion offer was rejected, partly because of the target company's concerns about the tentative nature of Odyssey's financing The terms were revised over the weekend to <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' satisfaction, and the deal was accepted In early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> rose 25 cents to $ 67.75 a share. <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> has made its bids in conjunction with the <ORGANIZATION> NTC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, parent of <PERSON> Bibb </PERSON>. Under terms of the agreement with <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> group will acquire the entire company for $ 68.50 a share under a tender offer that will expire at midnight EDT May 6, unless extended. Odyssey will then purchase its portion of the the <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> assets from <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>. But if <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> can not complete its end of the deal, <ORGANIZATION> Odyssey </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to purchase <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, subject to financing. Odyssey's outstanding $ 68.50-a-share tender offer has been extended to May 20. <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>'s interest in <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> has centered exclusively on the company's sheet and towel operations, which include manufacturing facilities as well as designer brand names. Those operations account for 60 percent of <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' annual sales, which amounted to $ 1.61 billion last year. Among the top brand names in <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' towel and sheet arsenal are <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON>, <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Gloria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vanderbilt </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Givenchy </PERSON>, among others. <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>'s brands include Arrow, Martex, <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepperell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Burberry </PERSON>. Headquartered in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> employs more than 23,000 people.

 Stock prices edged upward today amid expectations of further signs of a healthy economic outlook. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 5.30 to 2,020.39 by 11 a.m. on Wall Street. Gainers slightly outnumbered losers in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 629 up, 571 down and 498 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 50.98 million shares at midmorning. The government is due to issue its estimate Tuesday of the economic growth rate for the first quarter of the year. Advance estimates on Wall Street call for the figure on inflation-adjusted growth of the gross national product to come in somewhere between 2 percent and 2 -LCB- percent at an annual rate. Wall Streeters also are looking for a solid increase in the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s index of leading economic indicators for March, scheduled to be reported on Friday. While the expected data would be positive for corporate earnings prospects, brokers say they could also put upward pressure on interest rates.

The rig count, the widely watched industry index of drilling activity, gained some ground after sustaining losses of 12 and 25 in the previous two weeks. A year ago, the count totaled 765. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>' rig count reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs producing oil. Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an oil toolmaker company that merged with <ORGANIZATION> Baker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, has kept track of the number of working rigs since 1940. The rig count reached a peak of 4,500 active rigs in December 1981, which was the height of the oil boom. But oil prices plunged to less than $ 10 per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 and the rig count went with it, dropping to 663 _ the lowest since <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> began compiling figures. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the big loser the previous week with its count dropping by 13, posted the largest increase this week with 19 more rigs. Among other major oil producing states, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s count increased by three and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>'s was up by two. <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> lost six rigs and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> lost two. <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> each lost two rigs, while <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> each lost one.

<HEAD>Black Autoworkers End Strike Protesting Ford Pullout Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 About 3,000 black autoworkers returned to work Monday after staging a 10-day strike in defiance of their union to protest divestment arrangements made by <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The wildcat strike began April 15 at the South African <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s main plant in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>. The company, known as <ORGANIZATION> SAMCOR </ORGANIZATION>, said its entire paid-by-the-hour workforce joined the strike, and the production loss was estimated at between 1,800 to 2,000 vehicles. The workers were protesting an agreement signed last year by <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> SAMCOR </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metalworkers </ORGANIZATION> under which <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> donated the bulk of its minority holding in <ORGANIZATION> SAMCOR </ORGANIZATION> to a trust administered by the workers. The trust was intended to fund development projects in the communities where the workers live. But the workers maintain they should receive the dividends directly. According to an industry source who spoke on condition of anonymity, the strikers decided to resume work while negotiations with the union continued to resolve the dispute over the dividends. The union had no immediate comment on the matter. Prior to its disinvestment late last year, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> owned 42 percent of <ORGANIZATION> SAMCOR </ORGANIZATION>. The corporation was formed in 1985 when <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Anglo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s largest conglomerate, merged their South African auto operations.

 Grain and soybean futures prices opened mostly higher today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> report showing lower-than-expected levels of soybean meal stocks in March supported the soy complex and the grain markets, analysts said. The agency said this morning that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> meal stocks totaled 243,000 tons at the end of March, well short of pre-report trade estimates of between 290,000 and 320,000 tons. `` This indicates that March was a very good month for domestic use and exports,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Loewy </PERSON>, senior grain and oilseed analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Corn was narrowly mixed in early trading. Wheat was slightly higher amid concerns about dry weather in spring wheat growing areas, analysts said. In early trading, wheat was -RCB- cent to 1 -LCB- cents higher with the contract for delivery in May at $ 3.16 a bushel; corn was -LCB- cent lower to -RCB- cent higher with May at $ 2.00 -RCB- a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 2 cents higher with May at $ 1.65 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent to 2 \ cents higher with May at $ 6.65 -RCB- a bushel Cattle futures posted sharp losses in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in reaction to Friday's <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report showing greater-than-expected numbers of cattle being fattened for slaughter. Pork futures also retreated. Live cattle were .07 cent to .97 cent lower with June at 69.85 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .18 cent to .67 cent lower with April at 79.65 cents a pound; hogs were .10 cent to .45 cent lower with June at 48.30 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .05 cent to .70 cent lower with May at 51.95 cents a pound. Most livestock and meat futures settled higher on Friday, although pork bellies were lower.

 Stock prices headed higher today amid expectations of further signs of a healthy economic outlook. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 13.09 to 2,028.18 by noontime on Wall Street. Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 7 to 5 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 772 up, 535 down and 517 unchanged. The government is due to issue its estimate Tuesday of the economic growth rate for the first quarter of the year.

<HEAD>Court Will Decide Contract Dispute Case Involving Exxon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to decide whether <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION>, a division of <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, waited too long in seeking to collect on a $ 19.5 million standby letter of credit in a contract dispute with a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> oil company. The justices said they will use the case to decide a procedural point on the relationship of federal and state court rulings in cases based on state law. Standby letters of credit are common in the business world. They are issued by banks to assure the prompt payment of money to one signer of a contract if the other signer fails to live up to the contract's terms. The bank issuing such a letter of credit is required to make payment only if it is presented with specified documents within a specified time. Exxon in 1981 contracted with <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to make reciprocal deliveries of crude oil. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> agreed to ship 558,000 barrels of oil to <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> Oil during July 1981, and <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> agreed to ship an equal quantity of oil to <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> from September through December of that year. <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> was issued a $ 19.3 million standby letter of credit by <LOCATION> Banque </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> et des Pays-Bas -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Paribas </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- that said $ 19.3 million would be payable upon certification that <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> failed to deliver the promised oil between September and December 1981. But the certification had to be presented to <ORGANIZATION> Paribas </ORGANIZATION> `` not later than October 1981'' _ an inconsistency with the contract's terms. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>, which delivered 558,000 barrels of oil to <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> Oil in July 1981, learned sometime in November 1981 that <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> would not be delivering any oil to it. Exxon requested payment from <ORGANIZATION> Paribas </ORGANIZATION> on the letter of credit but the bank refused, contending that <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s request was too late. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> sued in federal court even though its lawsuit, alleging the wrongful dishonor of a letter of credit, was based on <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> contract law. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> could do that so-called `` diversity jurisdiction'' rules because <ORGANIZATION> Paribas </ORGANIZATION> is not based in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. A federal trial judge ruled for <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> but the 5th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> last Oct. 8 reversed that ruling. `` We find that the obligation of the issuing bank had terminated even though it might not have been possible to present to the bank the documents required for payment bvefore the expiry date,'' the appeals court said. While <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s request for a rehearing was pending before the <ORGANIZATION> 5th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> court </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> appeals court ruled in a very similar case that under such circumstances a letter of credit's expiration date is unenforceable. In the appeal acted on today, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> is asking the justices to rule that the federal appeals court _ faced with a clearer definition of state law _ should set aside its October ruling and reconsider the case in light of the state court's intepretation of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> law. Lawyers for <ORGANIZATION> Paribas </ORGANIZATION> argued that the 5th Circuit court's ruling was based on `` well-settled principles of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> law'' and should not be reviewed. The case is <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Banque </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paris </ORGANIZATION> et des Pays-bas, 87-1467.

<HEAD>Whatever Happened to the Cashless Society?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In the beginning, mankind traded goods themselves _ a bushel of grain in exchange for a cow or a pelt in trade for a weapon. As skills developed and trade expanded it became easier to use mediums of exchange _ analogs such as metals or beads or other things prized for their beauty or rarity. And then we created coins, which substituted for the beautiful or rare precious objects that had substituted earlier for the actual products being traded. And then we invented checks, which substituted for cash. All these were great steps forward, and of course they portended even greater changes to come. But marketplace evolution apparently is n't a steady ascent in sophistication. We've been stalled ever since. Which, in a fashion, is prelude to the question of what ever happened to the cashless society and its cousin, the checkless society? Twenty years ago they appeared imminent. The leaders of technology said so. Instead of the customer handling cash, the bank would electronically adjust the customer's balance, transferring funds to the accounts of creditors named by the customer. Less need for cash, and almost no need for checks. While embraced by industry, the checkless and cashless society gained no more acceptance among consumers than the picturephone or ordering products by electronic computer. A good idea, perhaps, but not just yet. While advocates swear their time is coming, they concede that at the moment mankind seems to have achieved a level of marketplace sophistication that suits consumers fine. A study made at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> shows that cash and checks will be around for a while more. It found that 57 percent of families pay by check, 36 percent by cash and only 7 percent by credit cards. There are more dollars in the hands of the public now than ever before, says the bank's <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Keely </PERSON>. And the total is growing fast, rising to $ 200 billion in 1987 from $ 148 billion in 1983. Why do we like to keep dealing in cash? It's convenient, says <PERSON> Keeley </PERSON>, and almost everyone is likely to agree. It takes less time to handle than a check or credit card. It often costs less to pay by cash. And cash is direct and uncomplicated, thus highly acceptable. Even automatic tellers, those impersonal machines stationed in bank lobbies and reception areas, prefer cash. They are even more rudimentary than the least sophisticated consumers. They can not deal with checks. The banks that employ the automatic tellers are just as insistent on cash, since banks can process money _ exchange old bills for new _ at the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> without charge, whereas they pay a fee for the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s check-processing services. Why should people prefer checks to automatic electronic payments? Among the possibilities: Better record-keeping, more personal control, and a greater variety of options, such as who to pay first, and when and how much. But beneath all these obvious explanations is one that may apply to a host of electronic devices that have been proposed over the past two decades, a feeling that they're not fully understood and, especially, not even needed.

<TEXT>
 Shareholders of Firestone Tire and <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> have voted overwhelmingly in favor of the $ 2.6 billion buyout by <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, Firestone Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nevin </PERSON> said today. The Japanese tiremaker's $ 80-a-share offer was supported by 99.3 percent of the 58 percent of shareholders who voted on the question, said <PERSON> Nevin </PERSON>, who announced the outcome at a special shareholders' meeting this morning. <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION>'s tender offer expires Tuesday, and the acquisition could become effective Wednesday, <PERSON> Nevin </PERSON> said. Approval of the <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION> offer comes on the heels of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement that it would drop <PERSON> Firestone </PERSON> as a tire supplier for its vehicles. <PERSON> Nevin </PERSON> would not speculate on why <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> made the decision. `` To a Japanese company, the long term is considerably more important. We'll look at this as anything one has to deal with in the business world and decide what path the company has to take in the future,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Crellin </PERSON> said the automaker's action was part of `` our rationalization study,'' which is a periodic review of capacity and future needs of suppliers. <PERSON> Crellin </PERSON> declined to discuss how long the phaseout of Firestone tires would take or discuss the amount of business <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> does with its suppliers. `` We've got four other tire suppliers: General Tire, <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Michelin </ORGANIZATION> and Uniroyal-Goodrich,'' <PERSON> Crellin </PERSON> said. `` There are no plans to look for another supplier at this time. We will be informing the other four tire suppliers of the availability of increased business.'' <PERSON> Nevin </PERSON> said in a statement issued Saturday that he was `` surprised and disappointed'' by <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s move but said <PERSON> Firestone </PERSON> is confident it will find other markets for its tires without hurting profits. <PERSON> Firestone </PERSON>'s statement offered no reason for <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s action, but the company said it was `` advised by <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION> that the action will have no effect'' on the $ 80-a-share buyout offer. <PERSON> Firestone </PERSON> said the phase-out would occur over two years. Estimates in the trade publication Modern Tire Dealer show that <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> buys about 34 percent of its tires from <ORGANIZATION> Uniroyal-Goodrich </ORGANIZATION>, making it <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s largest tire supplier. <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> is second at 22.5 percent, <PERSON> Firestone </PERSON> third with 20 percent, General Tire fourth at 17.5 percent and <ORGANIZATION> Michelin </ORGANIZATION> fifth at 4.5 percent. Firestone moved its corporate headquarters in November from <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. It operates four <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plants with 1,400 employees at its main plant in <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Firestone </PERSON> agreed to be acquired in March by <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION>, after an unsolicited takeover bid by <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Pirelli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SpA </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kimball </PERSON> <PERSON> Firestone </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION> board member and grandson of <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Firestone </PERSON>, said he did not know what <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION> planned to do after the takeover, but he did not foresee shakeups in the company's top management. `` I think it is tight,'' he said of Firestone's corporate leadership structure. `` I have an impression <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION> plans to leave top management. But it's their call.'' He said it also seemed logical to leave the headquarters for <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> American tire-making operation in <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION>. Firestone is the nation's second-largest tiremaker after <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, with tires accounting for nearly 70 percent of its $ 4.2 billion in annual sales.

 Share prices on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> closed higher Monday, boosted by a stronger start on Wall Street and a spate of late buying. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed up 6 points, or 0.3 percent, at 1,777.6. Volume was a scant 307.1 million shares, compared with Friday's 514.9 million shares Traders said the stronger Wall Street opening helped to raise most share prices from their midday doldrums. But traders said interest in opening new positions in the market remained slim in the absence of new market-affecting news and ahead of Thursday's release of first-quarter profit figures for <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, one of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s largest companies, and Friday's <LOCATION> U.K. </LOCATION> trade data for March. `` The main feature of this market is that volume remains strikingly slim,'' one equity salesman said. Even issues that were the center of takeover talk last week `` have seemed to fade from the public's consciousness,'' he added.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it was delaying by two months the effective date of a rule designed to make it easier for investors to shop for mutual funds. The commission said mutual funds can wait until July 1 before they must calculate yield in a standardized way so that consumers can readily compare the track records of competing funds.

 <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, facing a hostile takeover attempt by a British-owned conglomerate, said Monday its board of directors has ended talks on a possible leveraged buyout and would prefer that the company stay independent. The insurer's board members, in a meeting Saturday, also repeated their opposition to the $ 4.5 billion offer from <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which is owned by <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, Farmers said. There was no immediate response from <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION>, which has headquarters in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky </LOCATION>. The possibility of a leveraged buyout has been alluded to in sparring over the <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> offer, but the name of the entity with which the talks were held has n't been revealed. The board voted unanimously to end discussions of a leveraged buyout, Farmers said. `` While the company is continuing to explore possible alternatives, the board reaffirmed its view that the interests of Farmers and its shareholders would be best served by the company remaining an independent entity,'' Farmers said. Farmers, which ranks third in the nation in home and auto insurance and is the seventh-largest property and casualty insurer, has said it is willing to talk with <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION>, but the two companies have failed to agree on ground rules for negotiations. <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> is a retailing, tobacco and paper companies whose better known operations include <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fifth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avenue </ORGANIZATION> department stores and Kool cigarettes.

<HEAD>SmithKline Reports Increase in Sales, Profits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beckman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Monday reported a 14 percent increase in its first quarter profit, boosted by strong sales in its eye-care division and a weak American dollar. The Philadelphia-based company said net income for the first three months of this year totaled $ 116.5 million, or $ 1.34 a share, compared with earnings of $ 146.4 million, or $ 1.15 per share, a year ago. Sales rose 16 percent, to $ 1.16 billion from $ 1 billion in 1987. `` The sales gain was marked by strong performance from the diagnostic-analytical and eye care groups together with favorable currency exchange rates,'' said Chairman <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wendt </PERSON>. `` The weaker <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar had the effect of adding $ 55 million to corporate sales. Ethical pharmaceutical sales, marked by strong international results, were 10 percent above last year's first quarter,'' he said. The company reported an increase of 14 percent in worldwide sales of Tagamet, an ulcer drug, but a 35 percent decrease in the sales of Dyazide, a hypertension medicine. <PERSON> Wendt </PERSON> blamed the drop on generic competition and wholesaler buying patters. <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> reported that <ORGANIZATION> Allegan </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the company's eye-care business, recorded a 30 percent sales increase.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar rose slightly against most major currencies in quiet European trading Monday. Gold prices also edged higher.

 Stock prices rose today amid expectations of further signs of a healthy economic outlook. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 20.06 to 2,035.15 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.

 Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly lower Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> despite indications early in the session that demand for soybean products was stronger than anticipated.

 Workers with their sights set on moving up in the business world may do better in eyeglasses, says a new study that found corporate recruiters look favorably on the bespectacled. The survey, conducted by the Dallas-based <ORGANIZATION> Pearle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, found 79 percent of the corporate recruiters and fashion-image consultants queried said that glasses connote intelligence. Sixty-nine percent said they viewed glasses as enhancing a professional image. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Dono </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Pearle </ORGANIZATION>'s senior vice president of marketing, said Monday that the survey does n't necessarily mean the 20-20 set should rush to buy glasses, but it could be a consideration for those who need corrective lenses. `` Eyeglasses are not only functional for vision correction, but they also make a statement about the individual wearing them,'' <PERSON> Dono </PERSON> said. `` Today's consumer may purchase glasses as a fashion accessory, or to project a more business-like image for that ` board room' look.'' <ORGANIZATION> Pearle </ORGANIZATION> researchers interviewed 100 corporate recruiters and image consultants in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. About 60 percent of those polled recruit either for executive-level positions or for the financial or communications field. The survey reported 80 percent of the respondents think eyeglasses help the wearer focus on making a power statement during a business presentation. Removing glasses at strategic points is considered an effective way to emphasize a particular word or phrase. A third of those surveyed admitted using glasses for such a purpose. `` It's an eye-opener to people who are buying eyeglasses today,'' <PERSON> Dono </PERSON> said. `` Many people who are buying glasses today have n't bought eyewear in about two years. Everything has changed since then. The materials are running the gamut from plastic to metal to carbon, a very light metal, titanium. And then there are cosmetic tints available on the lenses and lightweight plastic lenses.'' The poll showed the best choice for the work environment for both men and women is the the classic tortoise-shell frame style, which for years has suggested a studious, `` bookworm'' image for the wearer. The second-most popular styles with recruiters on men were wire frames, while ultra-modern designer frames ranked second for women applicants. It may seem ironic that the survey favors wearing glasses at a time when contact lenses have advanced to include not only hard and soft lenses, but also gas-permeable, extended-wear and eye-color-changing lenses. `` Not everyone can wear contacts, and many people do not like to wear contacts,'' <PERSON> Dono </PERSON> said. `` The fact that there are designer labels and quality brands is n't enough of an attraction for everyone,'' <PERSON> Dono </PERSON> said. `` But amongst people who have to wear glasses, the choices are more appealing today than they were five years ago. <PERSON> Dono </PERSON> said there may be some upwardly mobile business-types who will begin wearing eyeglasses even if they do n't need them because of poor vision. `` There are some people who will and already do wear them for that reason, but that's a small minority,'' <PERSON> Dono </PERSON> said. `` I mean, many people wear sunglasses not for the effects on they have on cutting out sunlight, but because the people think they look good.''

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> L.P. </ORGANIZATION>, a partnership headed by two <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oilmen, announced Monday that it has finished arranging the necessary financing for its $ 1.6 billion cash tender offer for manufacturer <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s stock. <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> said it has lined up financing commitments totaling $ 1.9 billion, including a $ 1.4 billion bank facility and $ 500 million in subordinated debt. The partnership, led by oilmen <PERSON> Cyril </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, has offered $ 42 a share in cash for up to 39 million shares of <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION>'s 45.7 million common shares it does n't already own. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> would offer around $ 600 million in debt securities and warrants, or rights to purchase stock, also valued at $ 42 each, for the balance of the deal. The cash and securities portions of the takeover bid have a total value of around $ 2.2 billion. Chicago-based USG, a manufacturer of paper, plaster and wood products, including gypsum wallboard, has rejected <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>' offer as inadequate Desert Partners, based in <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, holds about 9.9 percent of <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION>'s common shares, acquired last fall for an average of $ 45 a share. The partnership's $ 1.4 billion bank facility, arranged by <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, includes $ 170 million available only for the payment of interest and expenses. The commitments for subordinated debt consist of $ 300 million from the investment and finance subsidiaries of <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> IXL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, an Australian conglomerate, and $ 200 million from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Inc.. USG's profit for the first quarter, reported Monday, dropped to $ 39.7 million, or 77 cents a share, from $ 85 million, or $ 1.65 a share, in the first three months of First-quarter sales rose, on the other hand, to $ 715.2 million from $ 693.2 million a year earlier. The company said shipments of its products, including gypsum board, were at high levels but selling prices for domestic gypsum board were 17 percent below the 1987 first-quarter level. USG is the holding company for <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gypsum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interiors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Masonite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and several other operating subsidiaries. Desert Partners tried last October to acquire USG, but the partnership said in January that market conditions had forced it to abandon its plan to offer more than $ 2.5 billion, or over $ 50 a share, for the company. In a recent filing with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> said it intends to explore alternatives to the acquisition of USG, including an attempt to elect nominees to <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors at the annual meeting next month <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION> sued <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> late last year, claiming that the partnership violated federal securities law in its negotiations with USG.

 Major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil companies, led by top-ranking <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and second-largest <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, reported strong improvements in their first-quarter earnings Monday, many citing sharp gains in refining and marketing, as well as chemicals. <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> also reported hefty increases. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> said its earnings were up 36 percent to $ 1.46 billion, or $ 1.06 per share, compared with $ 1.07 billion, or 75 cents per share, in the 1987 first quarter. Sales totaled $ 22.0 billion vs. $ 19.4 billion a year earlier, it said. <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> said its quarterly profit doubled to $ 505 million, or $ 1.23 per share, compared with $ 252 million, or 62 cents per share in the 1987 period. Revenue from continuing operations totaled $ 13.8 billion vs. $ 11.7 billion in the first three months of last year. Both companies are based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Among the others: _ <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said its earnings leaped 80.4 percent, to $ 469 million, or $ 1.82 per share, vs. 1987 first-quarter earnings of $ 260 million, or $ 1.02 per share Sales totaled $ 5.8 billion in the first three months, compared with $ 5.2 billion in the 1987 period, the nation's fifth-largest petroleum company said. _ <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION>, ranked seventh, said its earnings increased by 16.5 percent to $ 113 million, or 52 cents per share, compared with $ 97 million, or 50 cents per share, a year earlier Both periods included extraordinary gains, however. The Los Angeles-based company said its sales totaled $ 4.48 billion in the three months, compared with $ 4.16 billion in the 1987 first quarter. _ <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION> said its earnings nearly tripled, but were also affected by special items The company, ranked 13th-largest, is also headquartered in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION>'s quarterly earnings totaled $ 178.4 million, or $ 1.53 per share, on $ 2.3 billion of revenue, vs. $ 60.7 billion, or 52 cents per share, on sales of $ 2.06 billion in the same period of 1987. Included in those results were a $ 456 million one-time gain due to an accounting change related to income taxes. This was partially offset by an post-tax charge of $ 322 million for a writedown of certain company assets, the company said. `` Excess supplies and weak winter demand associated with warmer-than-normal weather caused crude prices to move sharply lower during the quarter. Crude prices in last year's first quarter were higher and relatively stable,'' observed <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> Chairman L.G. <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON>. The sharply lower crude prices, together with much stronger margins for petroleum products and record chemical earnings were `` fundamentally responsible'' for <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s overall earnings improvement, he added. `` The quarterly comparison was helped by sale of property abroad and lower incentive compensation costs in 1988, but the effect of these benefits was largely offset by the absence of 1987 foreign exchange gains and tax credits associated with foreign operations,'' <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> said the company's quarterly performance was the best since 1981, with the most important improvements occurring in its domestic refining and marketing segment and chemicals, which posted its `` best quarter ever.'' The latest report did not reflect the impact of <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ward </ORGANIZATION> unit, which was sold on March 7 <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> said the retailer made $ 19 million in profits, compared with $ 8 million in the first quarter of 1987. Those profits and proceeds from the sale will be posted in the second quarter, the company said. <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrow </PERSON> attributed the company's performance to substantial strengthening of refined product margins, compared with the same period last year, along with continued record earnings by its chemicals division In <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Armand </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON> said chemical operations more than tripled during the quarter. The company said its 1988 results included an after-tax gain of $ 53 million, primarily from the sale of a 25 percent interest in its <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> oil holdings, as well as extraordinary gains of $ 2 million, primarily from capital loss carryforwards. Its 1987 first-quarter results included a post-tax gain of $ 103 million from the sale of certain chemical operations plus $ 24 million in capital loss carryforwards. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartley </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, said the main negative factors affecting quarterly performance were higher dry hole costs and exploratory expense and lower geothermal earnings and domestic crude prices. These were offset somewhat by higher natural gas production in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and higher refining and marketing profits, he added. The writedowns included <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION>'s remaining investment in a shale oil project, about half its investment in mining and processing facilities in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and 40 percent of its investment in certain coking facilities at its <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> refinery.

The announcement came a week after <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> succeeded <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> as <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T chairman. <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>, who had headed the telecommunications giant since September 1986, died of cancer. <PERSON> Cassoni </PERSON>, 45, joined <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> after the American company and <ORGANIZATION> Olivetti </ORGANIZATION> signed a 10-year agreement under which <ORGANIZATION> Olivetti </ORGANIZATION> began to produce personal computers for both firms. Wall Street analysts said they did not know whether <PERSON> Cassoni </PERSON>'s departure was being planned before <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>'s death, although <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said in a statement, `` When we brought <PERSON> Vittorio </PERSON> to <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T in 1986, it was understood that he would eventually return to <ORGANIZATION> Olivetti </ORGANIZATION>. `` No one knows the answer to that,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bain </PERSON>, who tracks <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T for the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` I'm tempted to say it must have been; they would n't undertake something at this high level at a whim. <PERSON> Olivetti </PERSON> was disappointed recently by <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION>'s refusal to increase its 23 percent stake in the Italian company, but <PERSON> Bain </PERSON> said it was not known if there was a connection between that event and <PERSON> Cassoni </PERSON>'s resignation.

However, <PERSON> McKeever </PERSON> added: `` A good chunk of his work is behind.

 <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cities-ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday its first quarter profit nearly tripled despite a wider loss at its <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>. The communications giant warned that its business outlook for the rest of the year `` is not as encouraging,'' however, because of anticipated weak advertising demand for the television network and specialized publications. Capital Cities said it earned $ 70.3 million, or $ 4.16 a share, in the three months ended April 4 compared with $ 23.9 million, or $ 1.43 a share, a year earlier. First quarter revenue rose 34 percent to $ 1.29 billion from $ 959 million a year earlier. On an operating basis, income rose 72.2 percent to $ 167 million in the quarter from $ 97.3 million in 1987. Broadcasting revenue, which includes revenue for the company's eight television stations, 21 radio stations and its 80 percent interest in the <ORGANIZATION> ESPN </ORGANIZATION> cable network as well as for the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> network, rose 44 percent to $ 1.04 billion mainly due to the 1988 telecasts of the Super Bowl football game and the Winter Olympics games Operating income in broadcasting rose 86 percent to $ 164.4 million from $ 88 million a year earlier. Nonetheless, the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> reported a `` significantly increased loss'' in the quarter. The company did not provide a specific loss figure for either period. The network earned $ 50 million in all of 1987. The company said continuing cost control efforts and income from the telecast of the Super Bowl by the network failed to offset a loss in excess of $ 65 million from the broadcast of the Winter Olympics. The network spent about $ 350 million for the rights to the games and production of the telecast but generated only about $ 285 million in revenue, according to spokesman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON>. The company said operating earnings for the company's television stations and <ORGANIZATION> ESPN </ORGANIZATION> were well ahead of last year. Publishing revenue rose 4 percent to $ 246 million, but publishing earnings declined 17.5 percent to $ 28.7 million. The company said there were modest revenue gains in the newspaper and shopping guide operations, partly offset by weakness in specialized publications.

 Stock prices moved ahead in quiet trading Monday amid expectations of further signs of a healthy economic outlook. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 22.21 points to 2,037.30. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 3 to 2 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Stock Exchange-listed trading, with 939 up, 603 down and 470 unchanged. <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> volume came to 156.95 million shares, against 152.52 million in the previous session. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index rose 1.18 to 148.21. The government is due to issue a report Tuesday on the progress of the economy for the first quarter of the year. Advance estimates on Wall Street call for the figure on inflation-adjusted growth of the gross national product to come in somewhere between 2 percent and 2 -LCB- percent at an annual rate. Wall Streeters also are looking for a solid increase in the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s index of leading economic indicators for March, scheduled to be reported on Friday. While the expected data would be positive for corporate earnings prospects, brokers say the figures could also put upward pressure on interest rates. Thus, they say, it is a tough call how the stock market will respond to the news. <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> rose 1 -RRB- to 47 \ and <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> was up -RCB- at 44 -RCB- Both companies reported strong first-quarter earnings.

<HEAD>Dollar Mixed, Gold Slightly Lower</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar ended mixed in light trading Monday, reflecting dealer reluctance to speculate prior to potentially market-moving developments later this week. Gold prices fell marginally after rising in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and falling in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> quoted bullion at $ 447.50 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, compared with $ 449.50 late Friday. Money dealers attributed the dollar's mixed behavior partly to uncertainty about the impact of a government report on first-quarter <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic growth due out Tuesday. They also said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s impending vote on a major trade bill, along with questions about the outcome of a planned <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> meeting with non-cartel oil exporters, injected uncertainty into foreign exchange trading. `` There's not much to say today,'' said <PERSON> Christianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandell </PERSON>, a trading analyst at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> branch of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Barclay </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>. `` It was quiet because there's anticipation about events that are happening later. Until those things come out, there wo n't be information to trade on.'' Traders said the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s report on the gross national product would be a tricky number to interpret. Estimates range between 1.5 percent and 3 percent, but it will be the underlying components of that figure that influence the dollar's value For example, if first-quarter GNP is high, that could boost the dollar provided that the growth was caused by strength in exports, thereby helping reduce the trade deficit. But if the growth was caused by strong consumer demand for foreign goods, that suggests higher imports, a widening trade deficit and a further decline in the dollar. On the other hand, a substantially lower GNP could boost the dollar because it implies a slowdown in imports. But it also could hurt the dollar by relieving pressure for higher domestic interest rates, traders said. `` It's really a Catch-22 situation,'' said <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Soria </PERSON>, foreign exchange manager at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> branch of <ORGANIZATION> Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar rose 0.35 yen to a closing 125.00 yen. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> it retreated to 124.60 yen, and in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> it traded at 124.73 yen, down from 124.91 yen late Friday. The British pound fell in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to $ 1.8730, cheaper than the $ 1.8880 reached Friday, largely because of weekend remarks by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> that sterling should n't rise further. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the pound fetched $ 1.8736, cheaper than $ 1.8840 quoted Friday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> compared with levels late Friday: 1.6753 West German marks, down from 1.6758; 1.3873 Swiss francs, up from 1.3849; 1.2317 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2324; 5.6862 French francs, up from 5.6845; and 1,244.75 Italian lire, up from 1,244.50. Late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> compared with late Friday: 1.6765 West German marks, up from 1.6730; 1.3860 Swiss francs, up from 1.3840; 5.6915 French francs, up from 5.6865; 1.8790 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8770; and 1.2309 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2324; 1,245.50 lire, up from 1,244.50. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold for current delivery fetched $ 448.90 an ounce, down $ 2. Gold closed in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at $ 449.50 a troy ounce, up from $ 449 Friday. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION> the late bid price was $ 450 vs. $ 449, and in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> it was $ 451.13 vs. $ 451.58. On the Comex, silver for current delivery fetched $ 6.355, off 5 cents. Silver was quoted in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> late Monday at a bid price of $ 6.42 a troy ounce, down from $ 6.46 Friday.

 <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday that it extended until Wednesday its $ 1 billion-plus hostile offer for <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Meanwhile, both companies continued to exchange barbs, with <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> saying it would not hold any more merger talks with <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> because the bank `` never intended to negotiate seriously.'' <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> countered by saying it is `` disappointed'' by <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>'s refusal to bargain and said its board `` remains fully committed to obtaining the best transaction for its shareholders.'' Bank of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> `` should return to the negotiating table if it wants to convince <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> shareholders that its offer is the best obtainable,'' <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> said in a statement. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> is offering $ 15 in cash and 1.575 of its common shares for all of Irving's approximately 18 million shares outstanding. The tender offer, which had been set to expire last Friday, began a month ago following regulatory approval. As of the close of business Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said 7.68 million Irving shares had been tendered. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> also is running a slate of 16 nominees for <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s board of directors. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>, however, is urging its shareholders to approve a complex restructuring plan that includes selling a major stake to <ORGANIZATION> Banca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerciale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Italiana </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s second-largest bank. <ORGANIZATION> Banca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerciale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Italiana </ORGANIZATION>, which emerged as a friendly merger partner last week, has offered to pay $ 75 a share for 8.5 million Irving shares, or a 45 percent stake in the company. <ORGANIZATION> Banca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerciale </ORGANIZATION> also would have the right to buy an additional 10 percent of Irving stock on the open market after the deal was consummated. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> has said that <LOCATION> Bankca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Commerciale </LOCATION> is unlikely to receive the necessary regulatory approvals. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s proposed restructuring also includes the sale of assets, such as its 50-story Wall Street headquarters, cost-cutting measures, and a $ 10-a-share special cash dividend. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s annual shareholders' meeting is scheduled for May 6.

<HEAD>Copper Futures Continue To Slide On Weakening Demand</HEAD>

 Copper futures prices sank Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> amid perceptions that demand for the metal is declining and supplies are on the rise. Precious metals futures also retreated on the Comex. On other exchanges, energy futures were mixed; grain and soybean futures were mostly lower; livestock and meat were mixed; and stock-index futures advanced. The most active copper contract, for delivery in May, fell 2.65 cents to settle at 90.95 cents a pound. Indications of slackening demand and rising supplies have pushed copper futures down nearly 10 cents a pound in the last two weeks and the market continues to display technical and fundamental weakness, analysts said. `` Even though you have fairly tight supplies in the near term, demand is not enough to justify these high prices,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbanel </PERSON>, director of futures trading at <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gruntal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; CO.. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON>, metals analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said he expected demand for copper to weaken further as summer approaches Precious metal futures retreated in reaction to the dollar's recent strength, lower commodity prices in general and beliefs that higher interest rates are just around the bend, the analysts said Trading activity was light ahead of Tuesday's release of monthly government figures on economic growth and the opening Tuesday afternoon of a meeting between the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> and non-OPEC oil-producing countries, which could lead to an inflationary agreement to limit oil production. Gold settled $ 2 to $ 2.30 lower with June at $ 450.10 a troy ounce; silver was 5 cents lower across the board with May at $ 6.365 a troy ounce. Nervousness about Tuesday's oil meeting also overshadowed the energy futures market at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where prices finished mixed. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 10 cents to 12 cents higher with June at $ 18.40 a barrel; heating oil was .04 cent to .61 cent higher with May at 51.21 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .24 cent lower to .65 cent higher with May at 52.05 cents a gallon. Grain and soybean futures settled mostly lower on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> despite indications early in the session that demand for soybean products was stronger than anticipated. The soybean complex had led the grain markets higher in early trading after the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> reported lower-than-expected stocks of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybean meal at the end of March. Corn futures weakened on poor export sales. The wheat market succumbed to continuing fears about dryness in the spring wheat growing region of the <LOCATION> northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Loewy </PERSON>, senior grain and oilseed analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Wheat settled 2 -RCB- cents to 3 -RCB- cents lower with May at $ 3.11 \ a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 1 -RCB- cents lower with May at $ 1.99 -RCB- a bushel; oats were -LCB- cent to 2 \ cents higher with May at $ 1.65 a bushel; soybeans were 2 -LCB- cents to 4 cents lower with May at $ 6.59 a A Friday <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> report showing greater-than-expected numbers of cattle being fattened for slaughter sparked a sharply lower opening in cattle futures on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, but prices recovered to finish mixed.

 From shoes to machines, the Soviet economy had trouble meeting the country's needs in the first three months of this year, the government said Monday in a sobering report on <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms. Perhaps the most telling admission in the lengthy report was that national income, the overall barometer of the country's economic health, fell 2.6 percentage points short of the planned level National income went up 4 percent over the first quarter of 1987, whereas the plan called for an increase of 6.6 percent. The same shortfall was reported in labor productivity. The first quarter of 1987, to which the new figures are being compared, was marred by overall poor performance. `` Now it's important for everything designated not to remain only on paper,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION>, the government's Cabinet, said Monday in reviewing the economic report The council stressed that many of the economy's bottlenecks were hurting the country's 285.2 million people. `` The shortcomings noted in the work of a series of industries and complexes became serious brakes in the buildup of production and increase in people's well-being,'' the council said, according to the news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>. The report covered a period in which a new system was introduced in the Soviet economy. As of Jan. 1, more than 76,000 state-run factories and farms responsible for 60 percent of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s production were required to depend on themselves for the revenue they need to operate. That is one of the key elements of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s economic reforms, aimed at giving local managers more responsibility and flexibility. The Communist Party chief wants to limit central authorities to overall planning of the economy and allow local managers to exercise direct control over production plans and quotas. The media said the reforms were not to blame for the shortcomings noted in the report. Industries and farms operating under the new requirements `` are performing better than those working in the old way,'' <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> said. Industrial production increased 5 percent over the first quarter of 1987, exceeding the 4.5 percent target set in state plans, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Belov </PERSON>, deputy head of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>, as saying. Energy production, transportation equipment, computers and medical equipment all grew strongly, the statistics said. But one-third of the machine-building industry, a key sector in <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s drive for greater efficiency, did not complete its orders, the Council of Ministers noted. Among the specific problems cited in the report, splashed over two pages of the government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>, were shortcomings in consumer products. It sais 87,000 radio receivers, 44,000 washing machines and 44,000 vacuum cleaners called for in state plans were not produced. Clothing and shoes were either in short supply or were left unpurchased because they were old-fashioned or of poor quality. In agriculture, meat, vegetable and dairy production failed to satisfy people's needs, and in some areas bread quality and assortment was poor, the report said. Of the 15 Soviet republics, <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> had the worst record from January to March for fulfillment of industrial contract obligations. Armenian factories completed just 98.5 percent of their orders, compared to a high of 99.9 percent for <LOCATION> Byelorussia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>. The report also criticized <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> for not raising workers salaries, improving household services or building schools, hospitals and cultural centers. During much of February, many of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s factories, schools and businesses were closed in a strike prompted by an ethnic dispute. The report was released as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence agencies released in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> an assessment saying that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms ran into serious obstacles in 1987. A joint report by the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the Soviet gross national product increased only 0.5 percent in 1987, compared with a 3.9 percent increase the previous year. It said the poor performance in 1987 was due to poor weather that hurt farm production and resistance to change in the Soviet bureaucracy. National income, the barometer the Soviets use, is a measurement of economic activity that differs from gross national product because it does not consider the value of some services.

 Senators traded last-minute sales pitches Monday as they fought for votes on a sweeping trade bill advancing in defiance of presidential veto threats. `` You let this bill go down the tubes and I'll tell you where the champagne corks will be popping _ they'll be popping in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and they'll be popping in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>. The bill, scheduled for a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote on Tuesday or Wednesday, was expected to pass with votes to spare and the major question remaining was whether it would get enough support to override a veto. `` It's close,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told reporters. Democrats were expected to back the measure overwhelmingly while Republicans were divided. The administration and its supporters said a veto would not finish off the issue for the year and that there still would be time to pass a stripped-down version that deleted the most controversial provisions. `` I know this is an election year and the majority party may be looking for a campaign issue rather than a trade bill, but I am confident the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> could pass a better bill if this one is rejected,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON>, D-Vt. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed the 1,000-page measure on Thursday 312-107, more than enough support to override President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s threatened veto. Over the last month, the administration has focused most of its criticism on a provision that would require all but the smallest employers to provide 60-day notice of plant closings and large-scale layoffs. A number of business groups have campaigned against the measure, saying it would dry up capital for investment, frighten off customers and cause other problems for management. Basic provisions of the bill would overhaul the system under which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> imposes import curbs in retaliation for international trade violations and other unfair practices. Among other things, it would make retaliation mandatory for violations except in certain cases, such as national security. It also would transfer from the president to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative the authority to determine whether retaliation was in order and, if so, what kind of sanctions to impose. Other central features would streamline the machinery under which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> imposes import quotas and tariffs to aid American industries that are threatened by surges in foreign competition. The measure contains scores of other features ranging from billions of dollars in agricultural subsidies to repeal of the windfall profits tax on earnings of oil companies.

<HEAD>Judge Tentatively Approves Settlement With Home State Accountant</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A state judge tentatively approved on Monday a proposed $ 5.5 million settlement of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>'s lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Andersen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, accounting firm for the collapsed <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Niehaus </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Hamilton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Common </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pleas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said he would accept objections to the proposed settlement and make a final ruling on May 6. The state blamed the firm for negligence in auditing Home State's books, which <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> officials said contributed to the March 1985 collapse of the Cincinnati-based thrift. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> denied the state's allegations and admitted no wrongdoing in reaching the settlement. The settlement was reached April 15, after the case already had gone to trial in the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION> of Claims in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>. The case is before <PERSON> Niehaus </PERSON> because he has jurisdiction over the state's liquidation of Home State The case is one of numerous civil suits the state filed in its efforts to recover costs of guaranteeing all the deposits of Home State after its collapsed. Home State was closed for three months until another company bought and reopened it in June 1985, allowing depositors to get their money back. Home State collapsed three days after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> had <ORGANIZATION> ESM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a securities trader in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, closed for bankruptcy with more than $ 300 million in debts. Home State was <ORGANIZATION> ESM </ORGANIZATION>'s biggest investor through securities transactions, and lost $ 144 million because of <ORGANIZATION> ESM </ORGANIZATION>'s closing. Home State's failure caused a statewide crisis for 69 other <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> savings and loans insured by the private <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guarantee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION>, which was weakened when Home State drained backup money to cope with losses and withdrawals by panicked depositors. A number of Home State and <ORGANIZATION> ESM </ORGANIZATION> have since been convicted of crimes in connection with the failure of the two institutions.

 An omnibus trade bill that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has promised to veto could be revised easily to his liking with its major provisions intact, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. `` I think you're a bit premature in calling in the undertaker,'' <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Liebeler </PERSON> told fellow panalists discussing the bill. The issue was raised at the 102nd annual convention of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> here. The trade bill passed the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> by 312-107 last week and is to be voted on by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> this week. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> objects to a provision requiring most manufacturers to give 60 days notice of plant closings and major layoffs. <PERSON> Liebeler </PERSON> said she thought that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would veto the bill and that, in a revised version, the notification provision would be dropped and the bill approved. `` You may in fact see a trade bill the administration will sign,'' she said. The other panalists were <PERSON> Makoto </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuroda </PERSON>, vice minister for international affairs in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Choate </PERSON>, vice president for policy at <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>; and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON>, an associate professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. The Japanese government has urged <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to veto the bill, which would punish <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for a subsidiary's sale of sensitive equipment to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and give the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative more power to deal with complaints of unfair trade practices by foreign countries. The panalists were divided on the bill, with <PERSON> Kuroda </PERSON> voicing opposition and <PERSON> Choate </PERSON> and <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON> supporting it. The flip side of the trade issue, <PERSON> Choate </PERSON> said, was foreign investment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, an issue he said the federal government was ill-equipped to handle because it did not keep an accurate count of money invested by foreigners. `` How can we have a good policy without good information?'' <PERSON> Choate </PERSON> asked. <PERSON> Kuroda </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s investment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would help revitalize the economy's of both countries and provide for technological transfer. The discussion, called `` International Trade: Is Protectionism Dead?'', was moderated by <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliot </PERSON> <PERSON> House </PERSON>, foreign editor of the Wall Street Journal. The panel was the first group discussion in the three-day convention, which began Monday. More than 2,000 people, including about 1,500 publishers who represent 90 percent of the daily newspaper circulation in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, are attending.
