 A federal judge Monday struck down <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>' death penalty law, raising doubts about the fate of 121 prisoners on the state's Death Row, including serial killer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacy </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> ruled that the 1977 law gives prosecutors too much discretion in deciding when to seek the death penalty, violating <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> directives that capital punishment not be imposed in an `` arbitrary and capricious'' manner. If sustained on appeal, the decision would invalidate the sentences of the 121 men currently facing the death penalty in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. They include <PERSON> Gacy </PERSON>, convicted in 1980 of killing 33 young men and boys in the worst multiple-killing case in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history. Prosecutors said they were confident the ruling would be overturned by the 7th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. No one has been executed under the state's death penalty law, which was upheld by the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1979. Judges threw out three earlier death sentences that emerged through the appeals process in federal court, but Monday's ruling was the first to address the constitutionality of the law. `` I think we knew that in some case, a -LRB- federal -RRB- judge would rule specifically on the statute,'' said <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Gottfried </PERSON>, head of the state appellate defender's office, which handles appeals for death row inmates. `` We did n't know which case it would be.'' First Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ficaro </PERSON> defended the death penalty law. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has dealt with that issue over 60 times,'' <PERSON> Ficaro </PERSON> said. `` We believe the statute is constitutional.'' <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, director of the state's <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> chapter, said, `` We're delighted with any decision that finds any death penalty law unconstitutional. `` We think they're all unconstitutional,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think there's any way to write a death penalty law that's constitutional. Legal experts agreed a ruling by the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> appelate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> court </ORGANIZATION> is virtually a certainty. Should the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decline to review that ruling, it would in effect become the last word on the law's validity. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s ruling came in the case of a double killer, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Silagy </PERSON>, who demanded the death penalty after being convicted in 1980 of a double killing in <LOCATION> Vermilion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Silagy </PERSON>, who has been on death row since August 1980, had his sentence appealed twice to the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and once to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, but was unsuccessful until his case reached <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> in one of the last stages of the death-penalty appeals process. The state's capital punishment law allows a trial court to consider a death sentence in certain circumstances, such as a multiple killing, when requested by the prosecution. The state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> upheld the law in 4-3 ruling in 1979. Dissenting Justice <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, whose opinion was cited by <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, wrote: `` Our statute contains no directions or guidelines to minimize the risk of wholly arbitrary and capricious action by the prosecutor in either requesting or in not requesting a -LRB- death sentence -RRB- hearing.''

 The government began a new effort Monday to rally <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies behind its proposal for superpower talks on reducing short-range nuclear weapons, which has caused a dispute with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> was quoted as saying <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s argument must have `` special weight'' because it is the alliance's front line, and a war with such battlefield-range weapons would be fought on its territory. Both the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> say the negotiations proposed by Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> might endanger Western security. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday that the elements of a compromise have begun to emerge with a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal submitted to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>. Quoting unidentified diplomats from several nations, the newspaper said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> proposed Wednesday that the alliance decide to upgrade the weapons and then announce unilateral reductions. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> would then challenge the Soviets to make cuts to the lower levels. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Monday that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> remains committed to a mixture of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> conventional and nuclear forces, called flexible response, as a deterrent to attack. `` The West German position demonstrates the special strength that <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> has,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` Our allies can debate quite vigorously these issues, yet maintain the basic strength of our unity. `` Our position remains that keeping the peace requires a strong <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance and a policy of flexible response.'' <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>'s remarks were the first official West German comment since a meeting Sunday in which Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> tried, but failed, to change <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s mind on the issue. In pursuit of support for the West German position, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> plans to visit <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> on Tuesday and <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> will go to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> has said it agrees with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> that negotiations on the short-range weapons should begin, but <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> has not made its position clear. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> claims the support of seven of the 16 <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orgnization </ORGANIZATION> members. In an interview with the <PERSON> Frankfurter </PERSON> <PERSON> Rundschau </PERSON>, <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> was quoted as saying: `` This is not a new demand that has only now been made by us and other alliance partners. This concerns putting into effect an intention which has already been stated in two alliance decisions.'' His ministry made copies of the interview available to other news organizations before publication in the paper's Tuesday editions. <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> has noted previously the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> decision at summits in 1987 and 1988 that negotiations on short-range nuclear weapons should be held at some point. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> say this is not the time. `` Naturally the German view must have a special weight because the Lance rockets are on our soil and because our army represents the largest conventional contribution -LRB- in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB- to the common Western security,'' <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s army has about 500,000 soldiers. Most of the alliance's short-range Lance rockets are on its territory and would be used there in a war. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> and <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> say <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> should not pass up opportunities to negotiate in important areas of disarmament, and they insist the time is right for taking up the battlefield-range weapons. The chancellor has said he wants the talks to begin `` soon,'' but has not proposed a timetable. A West German government official said privately Monday the chancellor was `` optimistic'' about a compromise. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> officials say starting negotiations now could lead to elimination of the short-range weapons and increase the threat from the Soviet bloc's superior conventional forces. After the meeting with Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> on Sunday, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said he does not favor pulling the Lance missiles out of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> `` under the present circumstances.'' Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON>, the American who commands <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, was quoted as saying he did not believe there was disagreement on strategy within the alliance. In an interview for publication Tuesday, the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Die </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> as saying: `` Recent statements make it very clear that there are no differences in the grand strategy. The importance of nuclear deterrence is recognized.''

<HEAD>Political Aide's Suicide Spotlights Japan's Money Politics</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 When the prime minister's political secretary committed suicide, many saw him as a victim of the money politics entwined with Japanese culture and tradition. Beside such Western-style institutions as a parliament and free elections, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has customs that demand exchanges of gifts and favors and lingering ideals of absolute loyalty. Japanese politicians spend campaign money in a very personal manner. Voters expect their representatives not only to bring pork-barrel projects to the district, but to help their children find jobs in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, attend weddings and send donations to funerals. Political secretaries spend much of their time going to family ceremonies and delivering obligatory gifts. Results of a survey published in the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> said a legislator or his representative attends, on average, 26.5 funerals a month. <PERSON> Ihei </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoki </PERSON>, for three decades Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s closest aide, may have killed himself Wednesday because more than $ 1 million in donations and loans he received from the <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> helped bring down his boss, who had announced the day before he would resign `` The tragic case of <PERSON> Aoki </PERSON>'s suicide pathetically calls for a drastic reform of the money-oriented structure of politics,'' the daily <ORGANIZATION> Yomiuri </ORGANIZATION> said in an editorial. <PERSON> Asahi </PERSON> said political aides `` function as ` cloaks' that cover up foul play.'' Of 13 politicians linked to the Recruit scandal, it noted, six took donations in aides' names rather than their own. Political secretaries, who would be called legislative assistants in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, carry a burden imposed by the money-driven election system. Most spend hardly any time drafting legislation, a job generally handled by bureaucrats. <PERSON> Aoki </PERSON>'s main task as secretary to a top leader was `` to raise money from big business and distribute it to legislators,'' said <PERSON> Kotaru </PERSON> <PERSON> Nogami </PERSON>, chief political editor of the <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Secretaries of legislators, in turn, pass some of the largesse on to their districts. `` Basically, a secretary does everything and anything he is told to do and he has to carry out any order to perfection, even though specific guidelines are not given,'' said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Redl </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, a political secretary to a legislator of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. When he began working in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Redl </PERSON> said, he was surprised to see aides in funny costumes dancing to entertain constituents at a local festival. He said he was exhausted by the dawn-to-2-a.m. schedule of courtesy calls and parties with supporters in the Hokkaido district of his legislator, <PERSON> Shizuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Sato </PERSON>. `` I talked to another secretary who had to do this all the time,'' the American said. `` He told me, ` It's like the old days. You have to be ready to die for your shogun.''' When <PERSON> Aoki </PERSON> killed himself, many people were reminded of the suicide in 1976 of former Prime Minister <PERSON> Kakuei </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanaka </PERSON>'s driver, who had carried payoff money in the <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> scandal. <PERSON> Tanaka </PERSON> eventually was convicted on a bribery charge. `` After the <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> scandal there was a lot of discussion of political reform, but it was never carried out,'' <PERSON> Nogami </PERSON> said. A partial reform limited donations, but the Recruit case revealed ways around it: buying many tickets to fund-raising parties and selling shares at bargain prices before offering them for public sale. Recruit was limited to contributing $ 115,000 a year to all politicians. In three years, however, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> alone got more than $ 1.5 million from the company in donations, stock-sale profits, loans and proceeds from ticket purchases. All of it went through <PERSON> Aoki </PERSON>'s hands. Such huge sums of money are needed, in part, because taxes cover only a fraction of what it costs to run the parliament. `` The Recruit scandal was born of the system,'' said <PERSON> Sato </PERSON>, 47, the young American's boss. He is a member of the governing party's cmmittee on reform and wants more government funds so legislators will be less dependent on contributions In the tiny office the government provides, he told an interviewer: `` The budget from the government allows for only two aides. I have 15.'' His monthly travel allowance of $ 500 covers just a quarter of what he spends visiting his constituency. <PERSON> Sato </PERSON> depends on a patron, former Prime Minister <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>, for political funds, and in return backs <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> in intra-party maneuvers. Patrons like <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> or <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> lead <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> factions that operate almost as separate parties, particularly in raising money. Explaining how Japanese politicians spend campaign funds in their districts, <PERSON> Sato </PERSON> said: `` It's different from <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. A simple television ad wo n't get votes. It's a matter of obligation and human feelings.'' Americans might see the exchanges of favors and money as graft or vote-buying, but in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> they generally are considered social custom. Contributions by Recruit were at the top level of an interlocking system of gifts and obligations stretching down to ordinary citizens. Some Japanese say they do n't mind politicians collecting large amounts of money because they usually recirculate it rather than enriching themselves. Giving gift envelopes of cash at weddings, funerals and bon voyage parties, even between parents and children at the New Year, is a matter of etiquette in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. A parliamentary survey indicated young legislators spent an average of $ 274,000 a year on cash gifts for funerals, weddings, community festivals and local clubs. `` When a politician gives money at a funeral, it's not because he's a politician but because it's a matter of Japanese custom,'' <PERSON> Sato </PERSON> said. `` Now it may be necessary for us to distance ourselves from Japanese habits.'' Among reforms an advisory group suggested to <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> last week was prohibiting parliament members from giving money at weddings and funerals.

 It was quiet last week in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, by the standards of a province in its 20th year of `` the troubles.'' A few children and elderly people were terrified by a mortar attack on a police station, and police shot up a car, but there were no additions to the 2,000-plus deaths caused by sectarian violence since 1969. There were several attacks on police stations. Charges were filed against alleged members of the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which is largely Roman Catholic and fighting to unite <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Volunteer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, which is Protestant and wants to keep the province British. These are the stories of a quiet week: SUNDAY: Masked gunmen crash a house party in <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION> at 2:30 a.m. and fire four shots. Police say the homeowner was held with one gun in his mouth and another to his head while being interrogated about a guest who already had left. No one is injured and no group claims responsibility. A 36-year-old woman is hit in the head as automatic gunfire sprayed the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constabulary </ORGANIZATION>'s station at <LOCATION> Clogher </LOCATION> in the western part of the province. She survives and there are no injuries to police, who attribute the late-night attack to the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>. MONDAY: <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> commandos fire three mortar rounds at the <LOCATION> Ballynafeigh </LOCATION> police station in south <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> as children walk to school. Elderly residents are evacuated from their homes, past a can in which a bomb explodes minutes later. No one is injured. A van used in the attack is stolen from <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> McCusker </PERSON>, who is held captive by gunmen, along with his wife, <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON>, and two children, for three hours during the attack. TUESDAY: A funeral is held for taxi driver <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, 26, who was shot to death the previous Friday night. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> claims <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> had been involved in sectarian killings. In <LOCATION> Armagh </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dermot </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, 26, and <PERSON> Niall </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, 22, are charged with setting off a homemade 50-pound bomb the previous Friday while a <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> patrol was nearby. An 18-year-old man from west <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> is shot in both ankles and knees. Police say it appears to be a punishment shooting, the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s way of dealing with people in the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> community whom it considers criminals The chief constable of the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constabulary </ORGANIZATION> agrees to pay a `` four-figure'' settlement to a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> councilman from <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION> who claimed he was repeatedly assaulted while detained in 1977. WEDNESDAY: Bombs explode at the <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION> police station and <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> post </ORGANIZATION>, and shots are fired at security force patrols in three other areas of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. No casualties are reported. <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON>, a member of the <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> city council from the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the largest <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> political party, says army tactics are creating tension in west <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. `` People talking to neighbors or passing the time of day on their own doorstep have been treated with contempt by some patrol members and subjected to verbal abuse.'' An army spokesman promises an investigation. The McCuskers are charged with withholding information about their stolen van. THURSDAY: The McCuskers are released on bail. FRIDAY: Police fire 30 shots at a stolen car that allegedly is driven through a checkpoint in west <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> at 1 a.m. Two occupants are seriously injured. Councilor <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Attwood </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> SDLP </ORGANIZATION> says he fears the incident reflects `` this hostility where people shoot first and ask questions afterwards.'' <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernadette </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavanagh </PERSON>, 29, of <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION>, appears in court on charges of attempted murder of a police officer and possession of grenades, guns and explosives. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Branagh </PERSON>, 45, of <LOCATION> Ardoyne </LOCATION>, is sentenced to five years in prison after being convicted of membership in the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> and possessing a nail bomb and documents useful to terrorists.

 The smell of marijuana wafted through the air, and plenty of iced beer was on hand as about 2,000 people lined up to buy tickets for The Who's reunion concert. During the weekend, some of the fans huddled under small tents, braved rain and chilly temperatures outside Radio City Music Hall for a shot at the tickets, priced from $ 75 to $ 2,000. <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Yankowitz </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> legal secretary, claimed the first spot in line by getting there Friday night. She slept through rain showers, chased scalpers away from her spot and then learned that the tickets were going to be issued by lottery. Promoters allowed those in line to draw a bracelet from a box. The bracelets, numbered from one to 500, allowed the bearer to return this morning and claim a place in line according to the number drawn. Each person is limited to two tickets. The British rock band will be performing its rock opera `` Tommy'' in its entirety for the first time in 17 years. `` Is it worth it? Yeah, I worship this band!'' said <PERSON> Yankowitz </PERSON>, who saw The Who perform at Shea Stadium in the group's farewell tour in 1982.

 Horsemen in armor, monks in brown robes and four musketeers gathered near the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> to commemorate what they say was the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' first Thanksgiving celebration, in 1598. The group took a step Sunday toward revising history with a re-enactment of the fiesta held April 30, 1598 _ 23 years before the Pilgrims celebrated in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. While the 400 settlers led by Spanish aristocrat <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Onate </PERSON> were celebrating, the Pilgrims were still in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, dreaming of a place where they could worship freely. The <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> sponsored the re-enactment. In addition to the armored horsemen, Franciscan monks and musketeers, it included a dozen sheep, a goat and a donkey to represent the 7,000 head of livestock the original settlers brought with them. No one is asking to move Thanksgiving from the fourth Thursday in November to April 30, but organizers want people to know about the 1598 feast. `` We do n't want to fight against any tradition,'' said <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Marti-Fluxa </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s consul general in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. `` But we feel it was a deprivation not to acknowledge the full history of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>.'' Mission Trail president <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said he wants the re-enactment to become an annual event in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>. The 130 men and 270 women and children in <PERSON> Onate </PERSON>'s party started out from central <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in early 1598 to settle along the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION>, according to the group's chronicler, Capt. <PERSON> Gaspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Villagra </PERSON>. While crossing the vast Chihuahuan desert of northern <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, the group ran out of water. Five days later and near death by thirst, they reached the river April 20. According to the <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Villagra </PERSON>, the settlers rested for 10 days before holding a thanksgiving feast a few miles east of present-day <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>. `` We built a great bonfire and roasted the meat and fish, and then all sat down to a repast the like of which we had never enjoyed before,'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Villagra </PERSON> wrote. <PERSON> Onate </PERSON> then took formal possession of the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> <LOCATION> basin </LOCATION> in the name of King <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> _ an action called the `` toma'' _ and his party eventually settled near present-day <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>, N.M. During the re-enactment, the `` settlers,'' led by the horsemen, wandered around the grassy slopes of Chamizal National Memorial near downtown <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION> and spied the river. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> rules prevented a re-enactment of the feast, but the actors recreated <PERSON> Onate </PERSON>'s toma, a solemn Mass led by the Franciscan monks and a celebratory dance. About 1,000 people watched the pageant.

<TEXT>
 The riots that shook the kingdom have turned <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s focus toward internal problems and made the country less of a factor in the Israel-Palestinian controversy over the future of the occupied territories. It has become increasingly clear that King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> was serious last year when he vowed never to negotiate on behalf of the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION>, saying it is a matter between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> themselves. The king was bowing to the obvious: The Palestinian uprising on the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> of the <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, which he ruled until 1967, showed he had little remaining loyalty there. It had shifted to the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. Even the idea of a confederation between <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state _ a proposal to make <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> independence palatable to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> _ seems only remotely possible these days. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> for months has said he will consider a confederation only after a Palestinian state is created, and only if Palestinians there and <LOCATION> Jordanians </LOCATION> in his country vote for it. Many old-line Jordanians, or East Bankers, oppose a confederation because it could give <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> a larger say in <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> affairs. Palestinians already make up half of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s 3 million people. Palestinians were almost nowhere to be seen in the four days of rioting that began on April 18 and rocked more than a dozen towns and villages in southern <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, the bedrock of support for <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>. The rioting, in which at least nine people were killed, was sparked by government-imposed price increases but contained a cry by East Bankers that <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> pay attention to their problems and give them a greater voice in running the country. Some have resented the prosperity and political prominence of <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION>, who were granted full citizenship when <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> merged with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> in 1950. Some also hold a grudge from 1969 and 1970, when <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas began to set up a state within a state in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, often harassing East Bankers at guerrilla roadblocks. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s selection Thursday of Field Marshal <PERSON> Zeid </PERSON> <PERSON> Bin </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaker </PERSON>, the former army commander, as prime minister partly answered that plea. <PERSON> Bin </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaker </PERSON>, a man of Bedouin stock, commands wide loyalty in the armed forces, which are still a favored occupation for Bedouin youth. He also was prominent in crushing the guerrilla movement in 1970. He replaces <PERSON> Zaid </PERSON> <PERSON> Rifai </PERSON>, whose Jordanian birth was not enough in the eyes of many <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> eyes to compensate for his father's Palestinian origins <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> will not renounce the Palestinians in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> itself. He has woven them into the fabric of his society, along with smaller immigrant groups such as Armenians and Circassians. But the king has demanded they act as Jordanians and his security forces watch closely for any expressions of domestic Palestinian nationalism. Israeli leaders still speak often of turning part of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> back to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> or putting it under the control of Jordanian security forces. But hard-line Israelis refuse to give up any of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> or consider any form of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> entity. They say there already is a <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> _ <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. However, some of the resentments that led to the recent rioting demonstrate that <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> is not a Palestinian state. No amount of introspection will keep <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> from being an essential player in <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace maneuvering. It shares <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s longest border and is permanently threatened by a conflict that has twice swamped <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> with refugees. The king has vowed to maintain his support of the Palestinians in the occupied lands and has been an important moderating force on the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s negotiating demands. His abandonment of claims to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> helped push the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to focus its attention on ending Israeli occupation there. And the Palestinian organization followed <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s longstanding appeal that it formally endorse <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist. That led the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to open a dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> in December and turn its gaze away from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> as the answer to the 41-year conflict. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> is urging Israelis to do the same.

 For years, residents of this rural community wanted nothing to do with native son <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON>, citing his writings in a Communist newspaper and his support for the post-Depression labor movement. But detractors were nowhere to be found Saturday as more than 750 fans waited in line hours to see his son, <PERSON> Arlo </PERSON>, perform at a benefit concert to commemorate the author of songs such as `` Bound for Glory'' and `` This Land Is Your Land.'' `` Thank you for being here,'' <PERSON> Arlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON> told the more than 750 people present. `` And I know that my dad thanks you also, very much, for this night. God bless you all.'' The concert, <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON>'s first in his late father's hometown, was a benefit performance to raise money for scholarships. For <PERSON> Arlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON>, the concert was a homecoming of sorts to a place he's visited many times but perhaps never really appreciated. `` I've been walking around the whole town feeling kind of strange,'' he said. `` I have other folks here. My grandfather and a lot of his folks grew up here, spent their lives here. I feel like I have encountered my own roots and I'm real happy about that.'' He spent much of his two-hour performance talking to the audience and, at one point, took a moment to joke about the controversy that has surrounded the memory of his father. `` I think a lot of good things are happening for my dad ... now that he does n't need it so much,'' <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON> said. The younger <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON>, known for songs such as `` Alice's Restaurant'' and `` City of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>,'' told the audience how he asked his father to teach him the words to `` This Land Is Your Land'' when classmates teased him for not knowing them `` I remember he sat me down and he taught me some verses that were n't in the schoolbook version. I did n't just go back to school, I went back armed,'' he said. `` It never occurred to me in sixth grade that other people would know that stuff. I thought that just went on in our house.'' The celebration was an emotional experience for <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON>, who said many of his memories of his father are of the years before his death when he had grown weak from a nervous disorder. `` I wish my folks were alive, especially my mom,'' he said. `` But at any rate, where they are now I know that they are looking down and having a ball, laughing hysterically that this could possibly go on here tonight.'' Eighty-year-old <PERSON> Ramona </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON> attended the concert and said she was happy her hometown honored <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON>. `` It's about time all this has come to pass. Woody has come home. It's just too bad <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> was n't here to see all of this,'' she said.

<TEXT>
 Three days and 2,000 miles apart, two little girls became victims of violence so shocking that disbelief was the first response of many. Then came love. Two-year-old <PERSON> Carmina </PERSON> <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON> was found April 15 in a remote county dump in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s scenic wine country with her throat slashed. Beside her lay the bodies of her two young sisters who died of similar wounds inflicted the day before. Despite her wound, <PERSON> Carmina </PERSON> told a detective, `` Daddy cut me.'' On April 17 in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, 5-year-old <PERSON> Erin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bower </PERSON>'s hand was blown off when she reached for a tube of toothpaste while shopping with her parents and 1-year-old sister at a K mart store. A pipe bomb hidden in the pump-style container exploded. <PERSON> Erin </PERSON> was the victim of a random attack, while <PERSON> Carmina </PERSON> allegedly suffered at the hand of her father. Yet the two girls are united by an outpouring of love from strangers across the country. <PERSON> Carmina </PERSON>'s hospital room was filled with gifts wheeled in on a brand new, shiny red wagon when loved ones gathered April 24 to celebrate her third birthday. The hospital was deluged with more than 500 toys. Clothing, balloon bouquets and other gifts are piled so high in offices that officials recently began urging well-wishers to contribute instead to one of several trust funds established for <PERSON> Carmina </PERSON>. Her 28-year-old father, <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON>, is in jail awaiting trial on murder charges in the deaths of her two sisters, mother, grandmother and the grandmother's two young daughters, and a co-worker of her father. In <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, about 20 federal and local investigators are still trying to find the person who planted the bomb. <PERSON> Erin </PERSON> lost four fingers and half of her left hand in the explosion, and the remainder of her hand was amputated the following day. Although doctors removed the lens of her left eye April 25, they are optimistic she will regain at least partial sight in the eye. She was released from the hospital Friday. <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> said so many gifts and letters arrived for <PERSON> Erin </PERSON> that he could n't even guess a number. `` She's become such a sort of touching and sad news event that all the staff follow it carefully,'' <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> said. `` I've heard many expressions of condolences.'' Unlike <PERSON> Carmina </PERSON>, <PERSON> Erin </PERSON>'s family remains intact. `` I'm just glad we have our little girl,'' <PERSON> Erin </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bower </PERSON>, told reporters. `` She does n't have a hand, but she's ours and she's got her same personality back She's going to be fine.'' By contrast, the public barely knows <PERSON> Carmina </PERSON>. Family survivors remain in seclusion, and the spunky little girl whose mother always dressed her in beautiful party clothes remains under 24-hour guard in the hospital to protect her privacy. The only available photo of <PERSON> Carmina </PERSON> is a small snapshot of her sitting with her two sisters. Doctors believe <PERSON> Carmina </PERSON> will remain hospitalized for five more weeks, but adoption offers have already poured in from across the country, according to <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Frost </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <LOCATION> Petaluma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in the northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Petaluma </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Carmina </PERSON>'s grandfather, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>, was the sole family member to escape the attacks unharmed, and county officials report that he has begun the formal process of asking to become <PERSON> Carmina </PERSON>'s guardian They are hopeful that her permanent home will be selected soon after her release from the hospital.

<HEAD>Book Shows Different Local Responses to AIDS-Infected Children</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirp </PERSON> says he saw <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> at its best _ and its worst _ in the two years he spent studying the way different communities reacted to children with AIDS. In his book `` Learning by Heart,'' <PERSON> Kirp </PERSON> offers a wrenching account of the paths taken by nine communities forced to wrestle with the dilemma of AIDS-infected children in school. From <LOCATION> Kokomo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Ocilla </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, which banished students in a frenzy of irrational fears, to <LOCATION> Swansea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, and a Hispanic neighborhood in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, where understanding and reason triumphed, `` Learning By Heart'' is a mirror on humanity _ and sometimes inhumanity. `` AIDS is a very powerful light on us,'' <PERSON> Kirp </PERSON> said in an interview. `` How do we deal with a crisis that directly touches our lives? Most of the time we do n't get to make moral decisions.'' His book, <PERSON> Kirp </PERSON> said, `` is really about <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> at its absolute best and absolute most mean-spirited,'' A newspaper columnist, magazine writer and professor of public policy at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kirp </PERSON> said he `` had a fantasy I could write this like politics and policy'' _ a dry treatise on how communities behave. Instead, he found himself repeatedly on the verge of tears or anger as he interviewed families and school administrators and government officials. He even dreamed about one young AIDS victim after a particularly affecting encounter. `` I did n't know what would lie ahead of me along the way,'' <PERSON> Kirp </PERSON> said. `` But for all the sad moments when terrible things are happening to good people, you find people who are behaving with amazing nobility. They are really ordinary heroes.'' <PERSON> Kirp </PERSON> did several drafts of the book, moving away from a judgmental stance. Doctors can tell parents over and over that AIDS is transmitted only through blood and semen, that classroom contact is virtually risk-free, yet fear persists. Among the most trying tales was that of <LOCATION> Ocilla </LOCATION>, where white administrators barred from school three black children with AIDS-stricken relatives. Tests showed that none of the children carried the virus, but the superintendent insisted there were no absolutes in dealing with AIDS. `` You want an absolute, I'll give you one,'' Dr. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON>, a local health officer, shot back in frustration. `` You ca n't get AIDS from someone who does n't have it.'' Teen-ager <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>'s protracted fight to attend <LOCATION> Kokomo </LOCATION> schools was one of the first involving an AIDS victim and one of the most widely publicized. `` I tried not to add to the chorus of condemnation,'' <PERSON> Kirp </PERSON> said. `` In 1984, when the story was breaking, the unknowns were so great, the ifs and the fears. My real unhappiness about the <LOCATION> Kokomo </LOCATION> story is that they got stuck there -LRB- opposing <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>'s return -RRB- and could never get dislodged.'' The Whites eventually moved away from <LOCATION> Kokomo </LOCATION> to a less hostile setting. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> told his mother, `` I did n't want to die there.'' The <LOCATION> Swansea </LOCATION> story was equally poignant but altogether different. There, a popular teen-ager with a passion for baseball was welcomed back by school administrators, health officials, schoolmates and their parents after he contracted AIDS. `` They were better than they had to be,'' wrote <PERSON> Kirp </PERSON>. The boy, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyle </PERSON>, 13, eventually died _ but not before he `` returned to school, read ` Macbeth' in English class, learned how to bake a yellow cake in cooking class, and won the science fair with an exhibit on the wonders of the human eye.'' <PERSON> Kirp </PERSON> found some common threads in communities that reacted nobly: well-informed school authorities and involved local doctors, who held lots of meetings to educate parents and let them vent their fears, and who talked about the ill child as `` one of us as opposed to one of them.'' The most spectacular example of tactics that backfired was in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, where authorities let parents know exactly 48 hours in advance that a second-grade AIDS victim would be attending school somewhere in the vast anonymous metropolis. The result was furious parents, a massive boycott and a court case ultimately decided in favor of the city. At one point in his book, <PERSON> Kirp </PERSON> comments that `` it seems strange that a question as basic as the rights of children with AIDS should be decided locally.'' He concludes with criticism of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, accusing the former president of a silence that set cities and towns adrift as they tried to cope. `` The historians will wonder how it was that the nation's president through much of the decade ... could have been mute on AIDS for so long; and when he finally spoke out, could have been so inarticulate,'' <PERSON> Kirp </PERSON> wrote `` The right words from the president, at the right moment, could have made all the difference.'' <PERSON> Kirp </PERSON> recalled what happened to the three AIDS-stricken Ray boys of <LOCATION> Arcadia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. Their home was burned to the ground in 1987 after their parents had fought to enroll them in school `` I just got furious thinking of that,'' <PERSON> Kirp </PERSON> said. `` What happened in places like <LOCATION> Arcadia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kokomo </LOCATION> made no sense. Powerful signals from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> could have changed attitudes. But there was nobody in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> communicating any sort of moral message.''

<HEAD>Tropical Oil Use Down in US Food Products</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The use of so-called tropical oils by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> food manufacturers has fallen considerably in recent years, but the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says it wo n't make much difference economically. Imported products such as palm oil, palm kernel oil and coconut oil have been attacked vigorously by many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm and consumer interests because of their high levels of saturated fats and possible effects on health. The department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> says the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> used about 14.5 billion pounds of fats and oils in food products in the last year but that only 550 million pounds, or 4 percent, were tropical oils. Soybean oil accounted for more than 10 billion pounds; corn oil, 950 million pounds; and cottonseed oil, 800 million. Animal fats _ lard and tallow _ totaled about 1.1 billion pounds. Other sources of vegetable oil include sunflower seed and rapeseed. Major edible uses of fats and oils are salad and cooking oils; baking and frying fats; and margarine. Economists <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Cummings </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaub </PERSON> said that use of tropical oils in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> may average about 1.84 billion pounds since 1985, but the portion used in food products is expected to average only about 650 million pounds a year, down from the record 1.6 billion pounds in the mid-1970s. In 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soybean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, after watching palm oil and other tropical oils nudge into the lucrative <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market, launched a campaign highlighting the health benefits of soybean oil's relatively low saturated fat content. <PERSON> Cummings </PERSON> and <PERSON> Schaub </PERSON>, writing in the May issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine, said the soybean people were joined by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which began promoting the use of oils low in saturated fats. Tropical oil interests deny adverse health effects, and the <ORGANIZATION> Malaysian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Growers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> has mounted an information campaign and has underwritten medical studies to support its case. But <PERSON> Cummings </PERSON> and <PERSON> Schaub </PERSON> said saturated fats `` have been linked with high blood cholesterol levels and heart disease,'' citing last year's report by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> surgeon general recommending reduced intake of dietary fats, especially saturated fats. Several major food companies have eliminated tropical oils in all or most of their products, and others plan to follow. `` If edible use of tropical oils were cut 50 percent, the effect on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fats and oils markets would be marginal, because these oils are only a small portion of total use,'' the economists said in their report. `` Substitute oils would capture some of the small market share held by tropical oils.'' The report added: `` Prices also would be little affected. Those manufacturers using large quantities of relatively low-priced palm oil would experience the largest impact. Consumers would hardly be affected, because tropical oils account for only a small part of the price of finished food products.'' <PERSON> Cummings </PERSON> and <PERSON> Schaub </PERSON> also said that a 50 percent reduction in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> food use of tropical oils would have little effect on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imports and world trade, and the effect on suppliers such as <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> would likewise be minor.

 A final order is expected to be issued soon by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> clearing the way for a watermelon checkoff plan to finance a national research and promotion program. The department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said the next steps after the formal order is to hold meetings and solicit nominations for a 29-member board that will oversee the program. Those nominations are expected to be submitted by the end of July. After a board is selected, a proposed spending budget will be drawn up and submitted for review. The agency says it may be fall or later before everything is wrapped up. In any case, the watermelon assessments _ which are mandatory but can be refunded _ are expected to be ready for 1990 production. The assessments and the program were authorized by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in the 1985 farm law. A referendum was held in February in which approximately 52 percent of the growers and 56 percent of the handlers approved the plan. Agency officials said an estimated 7,000 watermelon producers and handlers would be covered by the checkoff program. The assessment, to be recommended by the board and then set by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>, can be levied at rate of up to two cents per 100 pounds of watermelons sold by producers and two cents per 100 pounds for handlers. All producers of watermelons having five acres or more and first handlers are required to pay the assessment. A grower of five acres or more who also handles watermelons would have to pay both assessments.

 Sales of cut flowers, potted plants, greenery and other commercially grown floriculture crops in 1988, a time of severe drought in much of the nation, dropped 2 percent to an estimated $ 2.24 billion, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. An annual survey of 28 crops showed that wholesale values of cut flowers increased 3 percent from 1987 to about $ 452 million, while the value of potted flowering plants declined 3 percent to $ 494 million. Sales of foliage, including hanging baskets and potted foliage, declined 7 percent to $ 477 million. The wholesale value of plants used for bedding and gardens declined 2 percent to $ 724 million last year, the report said.

<HEAD>Fight Over Owl Most Acrimonious Since Snail Darter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Not since the 1970s, when the snail darter took a run at a dam on the <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, has the Endangered Species Act been the focus of a dispute as acrimonious as that surrounding the northern spotted owl. The Tellico Dam was eventually completed, but only after a lengthy and bruising battle over the darter _ a tiny fish _ that reached the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the Carter White House. At stake in the spotted owl showdown is the fate of some of the oldest forests on earth and the role of logging, so rich a part of the heritage of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>, in the economic future of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. A medium-sized, mostly nocturnal bird, the spotted owl is fiercely territorial and nests almost exclusively in the cathedral-like ancient forests of the Northwest. The trees in these stands average 500 years in age with some of the giants up to 1,000 years old. When the first settlers arrived in the early 1800s, more than 20 million acres of old-growth forest dominated the landscape. No one is quite sure how much remains with estimates ranging from 2 million acres to 6 million acres. But if current levels of logging continue over the next half-century, the only suitable spotted owl habitat remaining may be in wilderness areas and the national parks. Environmentalists have used the owl as part of a campaign aimed at halting logging of these virgin stands of timber, the bulk of which are on federal land. Old-growth timber is among the most coveted by the industry and dozens of one-mill towns in the <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> are economically dependent on logs cut in federal forests. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> claims that protection of the owl could result in the elimination of 280,000 direct and indirect jobs in the Northwest. Conservationists say those estimates are `` hysterical'' and peg the job loss at about 2,300. They also insist that if all the remaining spotted owl habitat is protected the timber harvest on federal lands would be reduced no more than 25 percent over the next 50 years. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, reversing a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration decision that congressional investigators found was based more on politics than biology, proposed last week that the owl be protected as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act. The agency found that about 1,500 breeding pair of owls remain and that without protection their numbers could be cut in half by the year 2050. A species is considered threatened if it is `` likely to become an endangered species in the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range.'' The agency now has up to two years to decide whether to actually list the owl. But once the recommendation is published in the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Register </ORGANIZATION> in the next few weeks, federal agencies will be required to consult with the Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> before taking any action that would affect spotted owl habitat. Such actions could presumably include timber sales in the national forests and logging of billions of board feet of timber already under contract. Some have already suggested that the Endangered Species Act be amended to exclude the spotted owl from listing, though few lawmakers find the prospect politically palatable. Similar suggestions were made when the battle over the snail darter was raging. Interior Secretary <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON>, in a comment that sent shock waves through the environmental community, suggested the act might be changed to take into account the economic impact of listing a species. The Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is now allowed to consider only `` biological factors'' when deciding whether to list a species. The congressional <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> found that top Interior officials had pressured the Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s regional director in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, to reject a petition to list the owl 16 months ago This time, a spokesman for <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> said, the decision was strictly up to regional director <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Plenert </PERSON>. `` No one beat on me,'' <PERSON> Plenert </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON>'s spokesman, said that in such a `` highly charged atmosphere it would have been inappropriate for us to do anything but let the regional director make the decision.'' However, he said, future decisions affecting the owl could possibly be reviewed at a `` higher level.'' Although they are pleased by the listing, conservationists are still reserving judgment on the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's claim to environmental respectability. `` From a political point of view this was inevitable,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Frampton </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. `` Based on the scientific evidence they had no choice. There would have been an uproar if they had n't.'' <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Pissot </PERSON>, a wildlife specialist with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, said there are indications that the regional director's decision `` raised a few eyebrows'' within the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> `` But biologists and legal staff insisted this was their only course of action,'' he said.

 After discussing <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s demand for early talks on cuts in short-range nuclear weapons, Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> and Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> remained firmly divided on what has become a major <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> dispute Both leaders reported making little progress during an afternoon of talks Sunday on an issue that has split the alliance, describing their talks as frank and intensive. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> assured Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> of his country's firm allegiance to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, whose leaders meet in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> at the end of the month for a summit. The West German leader's call last week for prompt superpower negotiations on short-range nuclear weapons has placed him in a battle of wills with Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` We still have quite a lot of work to do,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> told reporters during a joint news conference with Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> after Sunday's talks in this village west of the <LOCATION> Rhine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Mannheim </LOCATION> However, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said he thought the issue could be worked out before the <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> summit. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> also expressed optimism, but stressed that all <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> nations </ORGANIZATION> need to agree on a common position. The British leader said any suggestion of eliminating short-range nuclear weapons in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is unacceptable and dangerous. At one point, she appeared to question <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s position on the issue. `` I'm sure Mr. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> will correct me if I have misunderstood him on this issue,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> responded by having his interpreter read a line from his speech to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> last week in which he rejected the total elimination of the tactical nuclear weapons under the present balance of military forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> say talks on reducing short-range nuclear arsenals should not begin as long as the Soviet-led <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> has a superiority in conventional forces. They also argue that it would be hard to stop talks from ending in the total elimination of short-range forces that Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> advocates. The West Germans say superpower arms talks should be attempted on a broad scale in light of the current disarmament climate in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. They remind their allies that most of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s short-range nuclear weapons are based in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and would be used exclusively on German soil in the event of war. Critics of the West German position say it divides and weakens the alliance at a time <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> must show unity on defense. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said elimination of short-term weapons would mean the `` <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will have achieved its objective of getting land-based nuclear weapons out of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. This I believe would be disastrous.'' Throughout the 40-minute news conference, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> repeatedly returned to the topic of flexible response and the necessity of upgrading <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s aging tactical weapons arsenal. `` Flexible response is not just something you mouth,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said. `` Strength must continue not only in words; strength has to be translated into weaponry.'' She added that the missiles must be upgraded `` because obsolete weapons do not deter.'' Under the flexible response policy, the allies could respond to a Soviet bloc attack with either conventional or nuclear weapons. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, faced with uncertain election prospects next year, wants to delay until at least 1992 a decision on modernization and deployment of the Lance short-range nuclear rockets. Recent polls show that the majority of West Germans no longer believe the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to be a military threat. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, while reaffirming his commitment to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s flexible response strategy, was also adamant that the West German position on missile talks be acknowledged. He said he hoped a `` joint document which takes our special situation into account'' could be prepared at the <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> summit. `` And that has nothing at all to do with the Germans having become unreliable or anything like that,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said, referring to suggestions that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is no longer following agreed upon <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> doctrine.

 <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> seems to be taking out his frustrations on the pavement as he sets off on a 6 a.m. walk down <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s Mall. The morning newspaper includes a poll showing that two-thirds of Americans are n't paying much attention to the ethics problems of House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and just 37 percent know that he's a Democrat. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, the newly elected No. 2 leader of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Republicans, is annoyed. `` My party is simply not an aggressive, tough competitor compared to the Democrats,'' he says, in full stride in hiking boots and a sweatsuit as the sun begins to rise on the dogwoods and azaleas on the Capitol lawn. `` Given a comparable problem at any given moment, Republicans are slower and softer and vaguer. We are not in the habit of going out and being tough. We're in the habit of being a minority.'' What should the Republicans be doing in the case of <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, who has been charged by the ethics committee with 69 violations of House rules? `` Here's a chance to say over and over again, ` It's sad, but you can understand after 35 consecutive years of being in power why the Democrats are having a hard time,''' <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> says, making his favorite link between power and corruption. `` Republicans have a chance to communicate what's wrong with the way the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is currently run. We're not using it. It's as though somebody filled up a theater for us, and our side decided not to perform.'' <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, the strident conservative whose complaint last year launched the ethics case against <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, seems to be having some trouble making the transition from gadfly to statesman. The <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> lawmaker has had some early successes in his new job as <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> whip, lining up an organization that includes not only his supporters but also some old-line moderates. And he demonstrated vote-counting skills last week when he was one of the few to foresee a chance to win a key budget vote on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor. But it has been difficult for him to follow the advice of senior Republicans who have told him to sit out the <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> affair. `` Everybody pretty much agrees that for right now it does n't serve anyone's interests to have <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> as the spokesman,'' says Rep. <PERSON> Vin </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Minn </LOCATION>., a close <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> `` It's very delicate right now. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> may be asked to act as jurors. It's very hard for him to play any kind of a role in that environment The country should not see Republican members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as a hanging jury.'' Part of <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>'s problem has been his inability to sell the notion that there is a clear link between a politician's ideology and his ethics. He has been striving to make that case in recent weeks, pointing to big-city <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> political machines as evidence that the party's ethical problems extend beyond <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` Ethics is in the long run a devastating issue if you're on the wrong side of it,'' he says. An occasional jogger slows to stare at this prematurely gray former history professor who is bustling along the Mall, keeping up a steady patter of politics before breakfast. `` Those Democrats who want to gamble that <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s little problems will disappear are welcome to do it. But it's both historically and morally wrong, and they're going to find that politically it's a disaster.'' `` Disaster'' seems to be one of <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>'s favorite words, along with `` profound,'' `` fundamental'' and the phrase, `` corrupt liberal welfare state.'' When pressed, <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> concedes that the Republicans have had their own ethics problems _ Watergate, and more recently <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> and <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> _ which have been costly. But without elaborating, he insists those have been less `` systematic'' than the moral shortcomings of the other party. And he does n't mention his own book promotion deal, which is being brought to the ethics committee's attention by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democrats. `` It's almost impossible to convince the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people that one party is the clean party and the other is the corrupt party,'' <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> says. `` They tend to view us all as the same. ... There is no clear partisan advantage.'' Despite his beliefs, <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> has been trying lately to suppress his instinct to batter <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> publicly. And at a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> speech last week he wore a button that said, `` Moderates make a difference.'' `` I obviously am more cautious now that I'm whip because I do n't just speak for <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>,'' he said `` I speak for 174 other Republicans in the House.''

 The case of a father accused of killing his comatose son by disconnecting him from a respirator is going to court, and two past cases fared very differently in the nation's courtrooms <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Linares </PERSON>, a 23-year-old house painter from west suburban <PERSON> Cicero </PERSON>, is charged with first-degree murder in the death of his severely brain-damaged son, <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON>, at Rush-Presbyterian-St. <PERSON> Luke </PERSON>'s Medical Police say <PERSON> Linares </PERSON> kept nurses in the pediatric intensive-care unit at bay with a handgun while he disconnected the 16-month-old boy's respirator Wednesday and cradled him until he was sure the baby was dead. `` I think he was definitely in a state of irreversible vegetative coma,'' said the boy's physician, Dr. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, director of the pediatric intensive care unit. `` My opinion was that recovery was not possible.'' Yet the hospital refused the family's request that the respirator be turned off, contending that <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> law prohibits withdrawing life-support unless the patient is already legally dead. Three years ago, a 25-year-old <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> father was sentenced to life in prison for killing his comatose 3-year-old daughter, whom he shot with a pistol as she lay in her hospital crib, eight months after she had been injured in an accident. An <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> case that began six years ago has a vastly different history. In that case, charges against a <PERSON> Beecher </PERSON> veterinarian who admitted crushing the head of his severely deformed newborn son were dismissed by a judge after two juries failed to reach a verdict. In both instances, the legal battles are dragging on. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> is appealing his sentence, which carries a mandatory 25-year term, in the hope of obtaining a new trial in the shooting of his daughter, Joy. He never denied the act. The girl had been in a coma for eight months after her head got caught between the foot rest and the seat of a recliner chair, cutting off her air supply. `` I could n't stop her from suffering,'' <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> told the judge, explaining his motive for ending his daughter's life. `` There was nothing I could do. It drove me crazy ... at least she's not suffering any more.'' In <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutors are hoping to get a murder charge reinstated against <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>, who pleaded temporary insanity after slamming his newborn son to the floor of the delivery room at <ORGANIZATION> Ingalls </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Harvey </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Marilyn Quayle Following Own Agenda During Pacific Trip</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is keeping an independent schedule and pursuing a separate agenda as she tours the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> with her husband, Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Quayles </ORGANIZATION>' first stop on their 12-day trip, Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> frequently went her own way. While <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> visited a pub, she toured a children's hospital; while he met with Australian Prime Minister <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON>, she went sightseeing at the national art gallery; while he dropped by a tennis clinic, she taught an elementary school class; and when he teed off for golf, she signed up for a tennis lesson. `` If you want to go out and see the country, go with <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said at the beginning of the trip. He called her schedule the `` more interesting'' of the two. Since <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> assumed office a little over three months ago, Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, 39, has kept a low profile, rarely granting interviews and jealously guarding her family's privacy. An attorney by training, Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has not practiced her profession in over a decade, though she told a group of school children in <LOCATION> Melbourne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, that she would n't mind returning to law. `` In my original job, I was a lawyer, but since my husband became vice president, I've had a lot of duties to perform for him,'' she said. `` So, I'm not sure I can practice law, although I would like to.'' Having apparently ruled out that career path for now, questions have arisen over how Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> plans to define her new role. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, for instance, used the second lady's slot as a platform to promote literacy, and <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> pushed the `` Just Say No'' program to fight drugs when she was first lady. Before the Quayles left on their trip, the vice president was asked what role his wife would adopt. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> made light of the question, responding, `` She has a very major cause, and a very major interest. ... A very complex and consuming issue with her _ and that is me.'' But on this trip, Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> made it clear she had her own interests, interests which often kept her out of her husband's way when he dealt with substantive topics such as grain exports. `` In addition to her official duties, she will also pursue her interest in disaster relief and disaster preparedness,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s office said in a statement explaining her trip schedule. In <LOCATION> Canberra </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was briefed on <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s national disasters organization, a group that responds to floods, cyclones and other such events. In <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> will travel from the capital to learn about coping with volcanic eruptions, and in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, she'll find out about cleaning up oil spills. On her first foreign trip as the vice president's wife, Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> seems to have adapted to her new status, whether standing somberly by her husband's side at a war memorial or dancing with him at a black-tie ball. During a tree-planting ceremony, Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> referred formally to her husband, who says he likes to be called <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>, as `` the vice president,'' and she has handed out souvenirs: <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> signature key rings embossed with pictures of the vice presidential mansion in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. But she does n't seem entirely comfortable with the constant media scrutiny. `` I've done my duty,'' she told reporters aboard <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Two after chatting for about two minutes four days into the trip. In fact, Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> seems to have some ambivalence about her role. Asked by a school child whether she ever thought she would be the wife of the vice president, she replied: `` It was n't on my agenda.''

 The fate of a man who held hospital workers at bay as he disconnected his comatose son from a life-support machine is at the heart of a controversy over laws governing hopelessly ill children. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Linares </PERSON> has been released on bail after being charged with first-degree murder for removing his severely brain-damaged, 16-month-old son from a life-support system. A tearful <PERSON> Linares </PERSON>, the father of two other children, cradled the boy in his arms Wednesday until the child died. The boy was to be buried today in a private service at which his father was expected to attend. Prosecutors, the hospital and the boy's doctor contend that laws prohibit anyone from disconnecting mechanical life support, even from severely brain-damaged youngsters who are not expected to ever recover. On the other side are defense lawyers and other physicians and attorneys who argue that the same laws, along with court rulings and accepted practice, protect doctors and parents from criminal liability when they decide to end futile treatment. `` It is our fervent hope that a case like this does n't become a precedent or a landmark, because the issues are so unclear, they are so murky at this point,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Scholz </PERSON>, the public defender for <PERSON> Linares </PERSON>. <PERSON> Linares </PERSON>, 23, a house painter from suburban <PERSON> Cicero </PERSON>, and his 21-year-old wife, <PERSON> Tamara </PERSON>, had requested months ago that life-support be withdrawn from their son, <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON>, who swallowed a balloon at a birthday party in August and almost suffocated. But hospital officials say the family did not seek the required court order. Despite extensive medical efforts to revive him when the accident occurred, the boy was `` definitely in a state of irreversible vegetative coma,'' said his physician, Dr. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>. `` My opinion was that recovery was not possible.'' But there was no legal precedent for turning off the respirator that kept <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> alive, said <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, director of pediatric intensive care at Rush-Presbyterian-St. <PERSON> Luke </PERSON>'s Medical Center <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a hospital lawyer, said <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> and the hospital could have left themselves open to prosecution under <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> child-abuse laws or, worse, been charged with murdering the boy. `` He was not brain-dead,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` He was not dead according to any legally or medically accepted criteria.'' Such a criterion is not required under any existing laws, said <PERSON> Fenella </PERSON> <PERSON> Rouse </PERSON>, legal director of the Society for the Right to Die in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` In a case like this for a child, withdrawing ventilator support is not the least bit controversial,'' she said in a telephone interview Friday. Courts in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> have supported the decisions of parents to end life-support in such cases, Ms. <PERSON> Rouse </PERSON> said, and `` most importantly, nobody has ruled to the contrary.'' Moreover, <PERSON> Linares </PERSON> is wrongly charged with murder for disconnecting his son from the ventilator, she said. `` There's no doubt about it _ it's legal. It's just as legal for the father to do it as for the hospital to do it,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Rouse </PERSON> noted that murder charges in a 1983 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> case against two physicians who withdrew life-support from an adult man were struck down. `` I think it's conceivable he could be charged with trespass, or illegal use of a handgun, or threatening behavior, but as far as I understand criminal law, he can not be charged with something like this,'' she said of <PERSON> Linares </PERSON>. Prosecutors disagree. `` Under no circumstances does any person have the right to take the life of another,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s Attorney <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Partee </PERSON>, who added he could understand the emotions of a distraught parent in such a case. The <PERSON> Linares </PERSON> family had been advised early about the possibility of obtaining an order in <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Circuit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION> for the hospital to disconnect the ventilator, and the hospital would have been supportive, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` Why they did not do that, I do n't know,'' he said. Dr. <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Schade </PERSON>, chief of hematology at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> and chairman of its ethics committee, said some legal authorities would say a court order is necessary for withdrawal of life-support, but he believes dealing with the next of kin is sufficient. But <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said that just because something is done does n't mean it is legal. `` We do n't like to be in the center of the storm like this, but we are following the law and abiding by the law,'' he said. `` I will be glad to change our hospital procedures, but the law has to be changed first.''

 Radio and TV stations could help take discussion of sex and AIDS out of the locker room and into the nation's living rooms, but the language must be frank enough to persuade skeptical teens to practice safe sex, broadcasters were told. Panelists at a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION> convention said Sunday that broadcasters can expect heavy criticism from some groups for public discussions of safe sex, but if they stick to their guns they also can change minds. Americans need `` direct language about sexuality itself, about sexual behavior, about sexual decision making so that it's not euphemistic and abstract and something they ca n't mentally cue into,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Tatum </PERSON>, a sex educator at <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mason </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. She said too often movies and television treat sex as a `` dirty joke'' or as something in which people lose their reasoning abilities in fits of passion. At the same time, kids are told by authority figures to think before they have sex. They often do n't listen, she said `` We're hindered by the fact that we think that any serious talk about any kind of sexual behavior is pornographic,'' she said. Critics can be a `` potent force'' against frank public discussions of sex, but another panelist, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> KTVK-TV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, said it is important that broadcasters take a chance. `` These kinds of campaigns take a lot of guts because initially you're really hit with an awful lot of rejection,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. But, he said, `` broadcasters have a lot to do with determining what's acceptable and what's not acceptable and how we talk to people within our society.'' He said his station found it difficult to find corporate backers for an anti-AIDS campaign because `` there's a stigma with AIDS. They were afraid of being the AIDS electric company ... the AIDS convenience store.'' But people's minds can be changed, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said, noting that a <ORGANIZATION> Phoenix </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishop's position on public service announcements about condoms changed so that now he `` is one of the most supportive people we have.'' `` After you see some of these things on television it becomes easier to talk about the subject. A lot of it is up to us,'' he said. <PERSON> Tatum </PERSON> said educators are looking for good visual material on AIDS and would welcome broadcasters' assistance. <PERSON> Toby </PERSON> <PERSON> Pate </PERSON>, marketing director at <ORGANIZATION> KPIX-TV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, said her station's Emmy Award-winning public service show, `` AIDS Lifeline,'' is being distributed to stations in 55 cities and is being used by schools. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuckson </PERSON>, public health commissioner for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, said the rate of new AIDS cases is declining in areas with heavy gay populations, while it is increasing in areas outside urban centers. He said such statistics show the value of public education campaigns. The panel discussion attracted less than 30 audience members at this convention, which is being attended by nearly 50,000 broadcasters. One member of the audience, <PERSON> Delbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, also from the <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> station, said he was `` angry'' that more broadcasters `` had not taken this ball and run with it and expounding more on the AIDS problem. ... We could do more,'' he said. Another audience member, <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> of WFMJ in <LOCATION> Youngstown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, said `` the fact that this room is nowhere near full, not even 50 percent, shows that there still is maybe a lot of educating to be done among our own.'' An NAB official said the organization for the past 18 months has been distributing AIDS spots and written material to radio and TV stations, along with suggestions for possible campaigns. <ORGANIZATION> NAB </ORGANIZATION> also has been helping distribute material from <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>'s anti-AIDS program, Americans for Aids Research, said <PERSON> Rory </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> NAB </ORGANIZATION> vice president in charge of public service activities. `` We did n't have any negative feedback,'' she said in an interview. A new campaign to be launched before the end of the year will allow stations to target high-risk groups with more explicit material, she said.

 As the Northeast sweats out the prospect of another summer of electricity shortages, much of the rest of the country is nearly drowning in power. Government and industry officials say utilities in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> may be forced to impose `` brownouts,'' or brief periods of reduced voltage, if this summer brings a heat wave as intense as last year's. A power glut in other areas, meanwhile, is creating problems of a different sort. <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is drowning in surplus power. Last month, state regulators in effect penalized the utility for having invested in power projects that today are not needed. The utility, facing financial peril, stopped paying dividends on its stock. `` We still stand in a very precarious state,'' says <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinneman </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. The disparate power supplies raises a question of growing urgency: Why ca n't regions with too much power send their surplus to areas with shortages? The answer lies in the fragmented nature of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s electric power grid. While it is physically possible to transfer power from one area to another _ and it is done regularly between some Western states _ there is no nationally integrated transmission system and no master plan for relieving regional bottlenecks. <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utilities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, calls the nation's inability to balance its regional power needs `` a travesty.'' `` If you came from Mars and looked at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> states ... and at the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, which we can say charitably is endowed with no shortage of capacity, and you saw that we ca n't get power from one place to another, there is no logical explanation for that,'' he told a meeting of state utility regulators. Some officials say the Northeast's power squeeze may be even more severe in a few years as growing demand for electricity outstrips the region's stagnant supply. `` The near-term outlook for the electricity system in much of the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> is grim'' unless the <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> nuclear plant in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> plant are activated, said <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, the deputy energy secretary. Local opposition to the plants makes their operation unlikely. In the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Bonneville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> has so much excess electrical generating capacity that it is holding back on conservation measures that could save power equal to the yearly output of 1 -LCB- nuclear power plants. `` It would just exacerbate our surplus,'' says <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> of the agency's <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office. Electricity rates in much of the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> rose after a consortium of utilities, after sinking $ 2.2 billion into a pair of nuclear plants, abandoned them for lack of power demand. Northwest consumers also are paying $ 14 million a year to keep two other nuclear plants in mothballs. Despite the regional disparities, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as a whole enjoys a comfortable balance between electricity supply and demand. In 1987, the latest year for which such figures are available, the nation's utilities had the capacity to provide 23 percent more power than was needed. The margin of reserve power varied, however, by region. A comprehensive study of the electric power industry, published last month by <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anderson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Cambridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, said `` no single measure exists'' for measuring the nation's power transfer capability. Some utilities are striking deals on their own. The <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION>, for example, put together a group of Western utilities to build a coal-fired generating plant in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, with one transmission line to serve <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and another to supply power to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hobart </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, representing the nation's publicly owned utilities, says the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> deal showed how long-distance power transfers can help a major city avoid the environmental controversy and cost of building new power plants in its own area. `` There are transactions taking place that would n't have been dreamed of 10 years ago,'' <ORGANIZATION> Hobart </ORGANIZATION> said in an interview. But such arrangements are more difficult in the densely populated Eastern states. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> state governments have proposed building a new power transmission line to provide the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> with coal-fired power from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, but the obstacles to winning agreement from the states in between are formidable. Power transfers are gaining prominence in part because they are an alternative to building new generating capacity. Utilities are reluctant to commit the huge sums needed to build new plants, largely because the memory of overbuilding in the 1970s _ before energy demand slumped _ is still fresh. It's a financial trap that utilities such as <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> are still struggling to escape. It sank $ 1.2 billion into the <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION> nuclear project in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> _ the nation's largest nuclear generating station _ in the 1970s when electricity use was growing at a 7 percent annual clip Demand fell before the project was completed. `` It's an odd Catch-22,'' said <PERSON> Brinneman </PERSON>. `` You plan for the very eventuality that the East is now going through,'' and yet a utility can suffer dire consequences if that does n't occur.

<HEAD>Fraternities Adopt ``No Grades, No Parties'' Rule To Help Image</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM KELLY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PULLMAN, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Leffel </PERSON> straddled a motor scooter behind the <ORGANIZATION> Sigma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Epsilon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> house </ORGANIZATION> and reflected on a future prerequisite for fraternity parties at <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>: good grades. `` I'm not too happy with it, actually,'' said <PERSON> Leffel </PERSON>, a sophomore. `` It seems like the university is continually working against us rather than with us.'' But the `` no grades, no parties'' rule that will take effect next year was n't the brainstorm of a scheming college dean trying to rid the campus of an `` Animal House.'' The Greeks, often considered synonymous with parties, imposed this rule on themselves to bolster their image and academic standing. Beginning next spring semester, a fraternity will have to forgo parties for two weeks for every 0.05 point that its grade-point average for the preceding fall semester falls below the average GPA for all male undergraduates. The rule, believed to be the first of its kind for an entire campus fraternity system, was adopted by the <ORGANIZATION> Intrafraternity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on a 22-1 vote of chapter presidents. The 16,000-student school has 25 fraternities with a total of 1,400 members. Council vice president <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> said his fraternity, <ORGANIZATION> Lambda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION>, would have been pinched if partying penalties had been imposed based on last fall's grades. But that has n't dampened his enthusiasm for the rule he helped develop. <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> and council president <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Downing </PERSON> said the policy attracted much interest at a Western regional conference of fraternities they attended recently in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` The <ORGANIZATION> IFC </ORGANIZATION> leadership wanted to send a message that kind of flew in the face of the stereotypical perception of Greeks, that all they're here for is to party,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, fraternities coordinator for the Residence Life and Housing office. He said he was n't aware of a similar campus-wide rule anywhere else. Some fraternity brothers question the correlation between grade point average and keggers, though. `` Maybe the problem is n't just with the partying; maybe it's with the teachers and stuff, you know? said <PERSON> Leffel </PERSON> of Sig Ep. `` I mean, a lot of my TA's -LRB- teaching assistants -RRB- are from foreign countries, and when I go in there to try and talk econ' I ca n't even understand this guy. `` You can party as much as you want and still make good grades,'' said a member of <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rho </ORGANIZATION> who was among a group soaking up sunshine on the fraternity's lawn recently. `` It's just a matter of budgeting your time.'' Some fraternity members claim the university pressured the fraternity council to adopt the rule, with some suggesting that President <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> is bent on making the campus dry. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> dismisses those suggestions, although he praised the council for its move. `` If we tried to put in a rule like this, it would be fought,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. Under the new system, even a fraternity whose members get straight F's wo n't have to abandon all merriment. The rules set a maximum penalty of 10 party-free weeks. Penalized houses will get to pick which weeks they'll spend on the social sidelines. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Downing </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upsilon </ORGANIZATION> said that if the rule was in effect this semester based on last fall's grades, 14 houses would have been penalized, with three drawing the maximum of 10 weeks. Delta Upsilon would have been forced to drop parties for two weeks, he said. Enforcing those sanctions could be problematic, though, says <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Thumlert </PERSON>, a sophomore at <ORGANIZATION> Sigma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Epsilon </ORGANIZATION>. Houses could avoid any party ban just as many have gone around another recent rule prohibiting buying kegs of beer with a house check, he said. `` You just do it through a private account,'' said <PERSON> Thumlert </PERSON>. `` And we've had more kegs this year than we had last year.''

 A broad-ranging study drafted by the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> recommends a coordinated government policy to halt the erosion of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> electronics industry, department officials say. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> McPhee </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION>, said the report calls for development of a coordinated policy led by the Vice President's Council on Competitiveness. He said work on the study, which was requested by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, has been going on since last November. `` We are now putting the finishing touches on an initial draft to run around the policy areas at <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, with the obvious intention of eventually sending it to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> after everybody has concurred on what it should say,'' <PERSON> McPhee </PERSON> said. He noted that `` many of the things that we recommend or concur with in the report are things that are under way or may be slightly beyond where things are, whether it's antitrust, or research and development policy, or science and engineering policy. ... It's a very broad report.'' <PERSON> McPhee </PERSON> declined to give further details on the study's findings, saying the report was not ready for public release. The Council on Competitiveness, chaired by Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, was established in late March to review regulatory and other issues bearing on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> competitiveness around the world. Its members include Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, budget director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Krist </PERSON>, vice president for international trade of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, an industry group, said he had reviewed a draft copy of the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> study. `` It portrays the electronics industry as a strong industry, having had really good growth. But that masks a deep erosion of competitive strength, because some other countries have increased their market share at a much more substantial rate and we've lost market share,'' he said. <PERSON> Krist </PERSON> noted that `` there's no simple solution to this. It's kind of a web of problems. It -LRB- the study -RRB- deals with a lot of these _ trade problems, the cost of capital, erosion in the educational base.'' `` My impression of it is that it's a good report, and one certainly I hope <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will give a lot of really serious attention to,'' he said. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smoot </PERSON>, executive vice president of another industry group, the <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said that `` regardless of what surfaces in <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>'s report, we have to keep in mind a fundamental fact about the competitiveness of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> electronics industry `` In some product areas, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies used to have 100 percent of the market share worldwide because they were the only ones that made the items. But in that situation, any competition from a foreign producer means the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies then have less than 100 percent. `` That's not inherently bad, but it's an early signal that the companies affected by the change must make changes in order to stay on top,'' he said. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> McAdams </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> economist and specialist on the electronics industry, said that in electronics `` our technology base is being rapidly eroded and we are becoming increasingly dependent upon foreign suppliers. We're getting close to the point of no return, where we will have real difficulty in recovering and re-establishing our own industry.'' <PERSON> McAdams </PERSON> said he was particularly concerned over loss of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies producing the sophisticated equipment needed to manufacture computer chips. One of the last such companies in this country, <ORGANIZATION> Perkin-Elmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Norwalk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, announced recently that it would stop making the equipment. `` When <ORGANIZATION> Perkin-Elmer </ORGANIZATION> is gone, that's a real blow,'' he said.

<HEAD>Breathed to Discontinue `Bloom County' Aug. 6</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Cartoonist <PERSON> Berke </PERSON> <PERSON> Breathed </PERSON> says he will discontinue his Pulitzer Prize-winning comic strip `` Bloom County'' on Aug. 6, and begin a new, Sunday-only strip the next month. The announcement from the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> was reported in today's edition of the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. It quoted Breathed as saying `` A good comic strip is no more eternal than a ripe melon.'' `` Bloom County,'' featuring Opus the penguin and a cast of other characters from the fictional locale, quickly became one of the nation's most popular comic strips after its introduction in December 1980. It is now carried by nearly 800 daily and college newspapers. Breathed, 31, was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for distinguished cartooning in 1987. In the announcement, Breathed said: `` The ugly truth is that in most cases, comics age less gracefully than their creators. ` Bloom County' is retiring before the stretch marks show.'' The cartoonist declined to comment beyond the prepared statement. But <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON>, general manager and editorial director of the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, which distributes ` <LOCATION> Bloom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>,'' said Breathed had been considering such a move for about a year. `` This was not an impetuous decision on <PERSON> Berke </PERSON>'s part,'' <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said. `` He thinks the strip may be past its peak in some way, which is n't true, but that's his decision.'' <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> declined to give details about the new strip planned by Breathed. `` It will have a different name,'' he said. Asked if any of the `` Bloom County'' characters might appear in the new strip, he said, `` Apparently not, with maybe one exception.'' He declined to elaborate. Six collections of `` Bloom County'' strips have been published by Little, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, with 4 million sold, the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> said.

<HEAD>Navy Planning to Reduce Nuclear Weapon Stockpile by 5 Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Three short-range nuclear weapons that account for 5 percent of the total stockpile of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warheads are headed for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> scrap heap, officials say. The weapons originally were intended to provide a nuclear deterrent against attacks on surface ships by Soviet warships and submarines. But <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> strategists now believe they can protect <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ships by other means. So, by 1991 the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> will retire the ASROC nuclear depth charge, the SUBROC missile and the Terrier missile, a total of 1,100 warheads, according to <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officers and documents released under the Freedom of Information Act. The decision to discard the weapons unilaterally was contained in documents obtained by an independent analyst, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Arkin </PERSON>, and first reported in Sunday editions of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. It was confirmed Sunday by <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officers who spoke on condition they not be further identified. It was not clear why the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration chose to take the step without public announcement and apparently without seeking to include the weapons in negotiations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The decision was prompted by the realization that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has more aircraft carriers and large surface vessels than the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and that such ships are vulnerable to nuclear attack, said <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officers. `` There is a recognition that if there is a nuclear war at sea, we have got more to lose than the Russians,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> quoted Vice Admiral <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mustin </PERSON>, who retired last year after serving as deputy chief of Naval Operations. `` The concept of a nuclear war at sea is a concept whose time as passed. It is in the interest of the country to persuade that the time has passed,'' <PERSON> Mustin </PERSON> said in the published report. <PERSON> Arkin </PERSON> said another reason for the decision appears to be a shift in emphasis by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> from short-range weapons to nuclear-tipped Tomahawk cruise missiles. The Tomahawk can fly below enemy radar and strike targets, such as bomber airfields on the Soviet mainland, at ranges up to 1,300 miles. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has been insisting that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> agree to limit or ban submarine-launched Tomahawk cruise missiles, but under the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> balked. The issue is being considered as part of a strategic review being conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> Bush </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, to be completed by May 10. The decision to retire the short-range nuclear weapons will not affect strategic ballistic missiles stationed aboard <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> nuclear submarines that form a key part of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear triad, land, air and sea-based weapons intended to deter a large-scale attack, said <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officers. The weapons that are being retired constitute part of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> nuclear arsenal that has received little public attention in the media or on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, compared to the extensive discussions that have occurred on the cruise and ballistic systems. The ASROC nuclear depth charge, carried aboard <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> destroyers, cruisers and frigates involved in anti-submarine warfare, has a range of up 6.2 miles. The SUBROC missile is carried by attack submarines, and is designed to fly at supersonic speeds, then drop a nuclear charge against enemy submarines. The Terrier anti-aircraft missile, which entered service in 1962, is fired from surface warships and has a range of up to 21.7 miles, according to <ORGANIZATION> Janes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fighting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ships </ORGANIZATION>, an independently published military handbook. <PERSON> Arkin </PERSON> said in a telephone interview that the strategy behind the decision was outlined in the Theater Nuclear Warfare Utilities Study, conducted in January 1988, and supplied to him with significant portions blacked out. As a result of the decision, said <PERSON> Arkin </PERSON>, `` scores'' of <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> destroyers, frigates and attack submarines that had been nuclear-armed will no longer carry nuclear weapons. It was not clear whether or how much money the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will save by retiring the short-range weapons.

<HEAD>Navy Has No Comment On Report Iowa's No. 1 Gun Misfired First</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman has declined comment on a report that there was a misfire in a gun at the USS Iowa's No. 1 turret shortly before the battleship's No. 2 turret exploded, killing 47 sailors. `` While it is under investigation, we can not comment one way or another,'' Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Marchi </PERSON> said Sunday, referring to the inquiry into the fiery blast aboard the battleship. The Virginian-Pilot and The Ledger-Star of <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, reported Sunday that a survivor of the April 19 explosion, Petty Officer <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON>, said the misfire occurred during gunnery exercises just before the blast ripped through the No. 2 turret. `` Later, after the explosion and firefighting attempts, they still had bullets in Turret One's gun,'' <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> said. The newspaper also reported that survivors said 12 sailors in the turret area survived the explosion. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has said only 11 men lived. Capt. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON>, the commander of the ship, has said there were no indications of any problems with the guns before the explosion. The ship's weapon's control officer, Cmdr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>, said earlier this week the guns had passed a rigorous inspection that morning. They had been fired last in early February, he said. The powder also had been inspected before the exercise, <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> said. The newspaper quoted <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> as saying quick action by Gunner's Mate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullahy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> prevented the fire from spreading to the ship's powder magazines <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> was contacted by the newspaper at his parents' home in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. The only survivors in the gun's area were those working at the bottom level of the turret, in the nearby powder magazines and in a narrow hallway that ringed the armored turret. <PERSON> Mullahy </PERSON> was on the turret's internal communications system when the explosion occurred, the newspaper reported. Unable to raise anyone on the upper decks of the six-deck turret, <PERSON> Mullahy </PERSON> opened the blast-proof door between the magazine and the hallway, letting in the three men who were outside, <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> said. Then <PERSON> Mullahy </PERSON> opened the door to the `` powder flats,'' an area on the turret's bottom level where powder is temporarily stored on its way up to the guns, the newspaper reported. There were no lights, only a thick brown haze and a fire burning to the right. The covers on several 110-pound bags of powder were also burning, the newspaper said <PERSON> Mullahy </PERSON> told investigators. <PERSON> Mullahy </PERSON> quickly got out of the powder flats and left the magazine, which <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> ordered evacuated, locking the door behind him. Once outside the magazine, <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mullahy </PERSON> threw emergency switches to flood the area. <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON> has said he ordered the magazines flooded seven minutes after the blast.

 The dollar rose sharply against the Japanese yen Monday and the key index on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> finished at yet another high. The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed at a record 33,793.17, gaining 79.82 points, or 0.24 percent. The index had gained 212.52 points for a record closing of 33,713.35 on Friday. The dollar finished trading at 133.90 yen, up 1.41 yen from Friday's 132.49-yen close. The currency started at 133.00 yen and ranged between 132.98-133 .90 yen Traders said the dollar started higher in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> following its rise in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> overnight. <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Takamasa </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamasaki </PERSON> said the dollar was strong though the only economic factor to encourage dollar-buying was market players' expectation that the central bank is unlikely to raise the official interest rate soon. `` Participants were less inclined to buy the yen because their expectation for the interest-rate hike seemed to have faded away,'' he said. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> conducted a rate check shortly after the trading began, and then sold some $ 100 million by mid-morning to halt the dollar's further rise. `` But $ 100 million would not be enough to reverse the current uptrend of the dollar,'' he said, adding that the central bank was only trying to discourage the market's dollar-buying mood. The <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> does not comment on its monetary activities. On the stock exchange market, `` trading was quiet mainly because of the yen's weakness on the foreign exchange and a holiday week,'' said an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity. The index inched up as some participants bought issues including steels and real estate, but most market players remained on the sidelines, he said. Stock and exchange markets are to be closed for national holidays on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.

 Confetti, a speech from President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and a parade marked the celebration of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>'s inauguration 200 years ago and the experiment in government it ushered in. `` Everyone here today can still feel the pulse of history, the charge and power of that great moment, in the genesis of this nation,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told more than 4,000 people Sunday at Federal Hall for a re-enactment of the inauguration. There will be more bicentennial anniversaries, including one for the passage of the Bill of Rights in 1991. But Sunday's events, capping a week of festivities, commemorated the official beginning of a new form of government that survives today. `` For all of the turmoil and transformation of the last 200 years, there is a great constancy to this office, and this republic,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` So much of the vision of that first great president is reflected in the paths pursued by modern presidents.'' After his speech, balloons were released, confetti and flowers were dropped from skyscrapers and military bands kicked off a big Wall-Street-to-Washington-Square parade, including military bands, fife and drum corps and people in colonial garb. Protesters chanted during <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s speech, hundreds of seats in a special section went unclaimed and several thousand people outside the section had to watch a sometimes balky large-screen TV screen 150 yards away. And when the stand-in for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> arrived in a fancy carriage, he was greeted with polite applause, not the sustained cheering that history books say occurred in 1789. But the sun shone, the speeches were short and many who watched said they were moved. `` There is a sense of history _ the Constitution lives,'' said <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall-Dutcher </PERSON> of King of <LOCATION> Prussia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, whose husband, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dutcher </PERSON>, played <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s aide, Col. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphreys </PERSON>, in the re-enactment. `` On every continent the people are demanding government by the people,'' former Chief Justice <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burger </PERSON> declared to the crowd. `` This is your Constitution. It is our Constitution. Let's keep it. `` It's a great thing to commemorate,'' said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, 29, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` It's so easy to take for granted that we have a democracy. Something like this drives home the fact that we've had it for so long.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, left the parade after a couple of blocks to head back to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, leaving the parade to <PERSON> George </PERSON> himself _ <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> actor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sommerfield </PERSON> who took the oath in the re-enactment. On Saturday, thousands lined the shores to watch fireworks spin through the sky on a rainy night. The rockets and flares painted the sky red, white and blue and anyone with radios could hear a narration by <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronkite </PERSON>. The weekend began with a parade of ships steaming into <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> harbor as cannon blasts greeted them. The biggest were the warship USS Ticonderoga, and the USS MacDonaough, a guided missile destroyer. The celebrations concluded late Sunday with a dinner-dance at the Waldorf-Astoria that featured descendants of each of the 40 presidents. <PERSON> Hilles </PERSON> <PERSON> Timpson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Quogue </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> is the great granddaughter of <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Buren </PERSON>, president from 1837 to 1841, but she said she did not feel as if her blood was especially presidential. `` I do n't think I have much of any kind. I'm always cold,'' she said with a laugh.

 Militant labor groups called today for major protests after the government arrested about 6,600 people in blocking a May Day rally in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Workers and students battled riot police in three cities. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Headquarters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Struggle </ORGANIZATION>, an alliance of militant trade unions, said it would hold a major rally in the southern port of <LOCATION> Masan </LOCATION> Thursday and warned there would be violence if police attempt to forestall the meeting. Labor organizers also called on workers at more than 800 companies across the nation to stop work every afternoon through Thursday to stage rallies. Police said today that about 6,600 people were arrested in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> during the weekend after riot police blocked a rally Sunday called by labor groups to mark May Day, the international day of the worker that falls on May 1. Protesters battled riot police in running street clashes in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> on Sunday after 20,000 troopers prevented protesters from assembling. Riot police firing tear gas battled about 5,000 striking workers in <LOCATION> Masan </LOCATION> and nearby <LOCATION> Changwon </LOCATION> today after protesters attempted to stage a May Day rally, police said. Some protesters set fire to wooden barricades to hold police back. About 20 workers were arrested, police said. Riot police also battled some 2,000 radical students in clashes at three campuses in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, police said. Students hurled firebombs and rocks at riot police to protest the blocking of Sunday's rally. Police have already banned the May 4 rally in <LOCATION> Masan </LOCATION> and warned that any attempt to stage an illegal protest would be blocked by riot police. Police were put on top alert to block the demonstration. Labor organizers claimed at least 50,000 workers would take part in the <LOCATION> Masan </LOCATION> rally. Radical students and dissidents are also expect to take part. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has been hit by a wave of strikes for higher pay and better working conditions. The government claims strikes have cost the economy more than $ 3 billion in lost production this year and has warned that labor unrest could cripple the economy and foment political unrest. Opposition parties said today that they would charge in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> this week that the government acted illegally in blocking the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> rally. The opposition said it would call for action against the senior government and police officials responsible. The governing <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is concerned the opposition will use the incident to try and claim President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>'s administration is not committed to ensuring basic rights. Many South Korean workers receive subsistence wages for very long working weeks. A growing number of workers are demanding wage hikes, better working conditions and a share in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s growing economic prosperity The government is concerned about efforts by radical students and dissidents to build a political alliance with striking workers to challenge the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> administration. The radical students and dissidents have been mounting violent protests to demand the overthrow of the government, but they lack public support because of their extremism and violent tactics.

<HEAD>Student Council Tenatively Reverses Resolution Asking ROTC Back</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>'s undergraduate student council has reversed its decision to ask <ORGANIZATION> ROTC </ORGANIZATION> back to the campus, declaring an earlier vote a violation of the undergraduate constitution. But the debate is not over. The university forced Reserve Officers' Training Corps programs from campus in 1969 by declaring the programs extracurricular activities without special privileges. The move followed a building takeover and student strike. Last week, the student council voted 41-24 to ask the administration to negotiate with the military and bring ROTC back. Sunday night, about 400 students attended the meeting where the council voted 43-39 against its week-old resolution. The resolution effectively said bringing <ORGANIZATION> ROTC </ORGANIZATION> back was in violation of the student constitution because the program denies membership and, therefore, scholarships to homosexual students. About 150 activists wearing pink arm bands and T-shirts demonstrated outside before the meeting and chanted, `` 2-4-6-8, no to <ORGANIZATION> ROTC </ORGANIZATION> _ gay or straight!'' During the debate, some students argued that barring <ORGANIZATION> ROTC </ORGANIZATION> may deny economically disadvantaged students ROTC benefits. `` The issue is one of symbolism verses practicality,'' said <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>, who supported bringing ROTC back. Others said fewer than 20 of the 150 <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> students who take part in ROTC programs do so at nearby <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> and receive less money from <ORGANIZATION> ROTC </ORGANIZATION> because their program was not on campus. `` Harvard has a need-blind admissions policy,'' said <PERSON> Deepak </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhargava </PERSON>, a ROTC opponent. `` If it's not living up to this policy, we should force it to do so.'' Although the council reversed itself Sunday, members next week will consider the measure that would approve <ORGANIZATION> ROTC </ORGANIZATION> on campus if the military did not bar homosexuals.

<HEAD>India Again Postpones Ballistic Missile Test-firing</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHANDIPUR, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> today postponed the test-firing of its first intermediate-range ballistic missile for a second time after a leak was discovered in the rocket's liquid fuel propellant, military sources said. A military official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said scientists detected the leak minutes before the scheduled launch time and attempts to repair it quickly were abandoned three hours later. On April 20, firing of the missile, named `` Agni'', was canceled after a last-minute hitch in the ignition system. The military official said senior defense officers and scientists had not yet decided when a third attempt would be made. The 7.5-ton missile has a range of 1,550 miles, Indian military experts say. It was to be boosted in the first stage by a solid propellant engine and in the second stage by a liquid fuel motor. A successful launch would make <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> the sixth nation in the world to demonstrate ballistic missile capability. The others are the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The Agni _ fire in the Hindi language _ was to have been launched from the Chandipur test range on the Bay of <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION> about 750 miles southeast of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. The postponement was met by cheers and blowing of conch shells by many of the 12,000 villagers who were temporarily evacuated from their homes around the launch site. The villagers fear they will be permanently shifted from their homes if the missile launch is successful and the test range is used for more firings. <PERSON> Agni </PERSON> is the fourth missile <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has developed since the Integrated Guided Missile Development Program started in 1983. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has already test-fired three surface-to-surface and surface-to-air missiles with ranges from 20 to 155 miles. Defense experts say <PERSON> Agni </PERSON>'s one-ton payload enables it to carry a nuclear warhead, although <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> has said its demonstrated nuclear capability is for peaceful purposes such as generating power. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> exploded a nuclear device 15 years ago, and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> nuclear experts believe scientists can assemble an atomic weapon in one week. The test-firing of the Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile is intended to be only `` a technology demonstration of the country's capabilities,'' according to the government

He went on to be assistant director on dozens of films, including `` Ben Hur'' and `` The Last Days of <LOCATION> Pompeii </LOCATION>,'' working with such <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> directors as <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyler </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Zinneman </PERSON>. The first film <PERSON> Leone </PERSON> directed was `` The Colossus of <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON>,'' one of a series of popular mythological films made in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> in the 1950s. The film won him a wide following and a flood of offers to direct similar films. But the American westerns he saw as a child were what captured his imagination and in the early 1960s he began to make `` A Fistful of Dollars.'' <PERSON> Leone </PERSON> paid attention to historical detail and attracted a solid cast led by <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON>, then an American television cowboy. <PERSON> Leone </PERSON> released the film in 1964 and it was a box-office smash despite the prevailing opinion that the western genre was in decline. <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON> recalled Sunday in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Leone </PERSON> used the pseudonym <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> to release the movie because `` in those days people did n't want those Italian westerns.'' <PERSON> Leone </PERSON>'s next film was `` For a Few Dollars More'' in 1965 and `` The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'' in 1966. `` The universal attraction of the western is that it is a great fable, a myth like Achilles,'' he told an interviewer in 1968. `` For me personally, the attraction is the joy of making justice ... without asking permission _ bang, bang.'' After the three westerns, <PERSON> Leone </PERSON> began work on a saga about <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> gangsters in the early 1900s. But he fell in love with a film he had co-written, `` Once Upon A Time in the West,'' and directed it himself, working with a cast that included <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronson </PERSON>. He followed it with yet another Western, `` Duck You Sucker'' in 1972. <PERSON> Leone </PERSON> had trouble in the 1970s finding producers who would foot the bill for his lavish productions and turned to producing other people's films. Finally, in 1983, he managed to finish `` Once Upon A Time in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' an impressionistic film using flashbacks and flash-forwards. The movie was praised at the <LOCATION> Cannes </LOCATION> film festival and was a hit in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, but it was drastically cut for its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> release and got lukewarm reviews. <PERSON> Leone </PERSON> had been planning to direct a blockbuster film about the siege of <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> by German troops during World War II. The directgor, who made his home in both <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, is survived by his wife, <PERSON> Carla </PERSON>, and his children <PERSON> Raffaela </PERSON>, <PERSON> Francesca </PERSON> and <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON>. Funeral services were scheduled for Wednesday.

<HEAD>`Family Ties' Finale Episode Taped</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Cast members of `` Family Ties'' celebrated the taping of their 176th and final episode, culminating seven years as the <PERSON> Keaton </PERSON> family on one of television's most popular comedy series. `` It's going to be awhile before it really hits,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, who played <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keaton </PERSON>, the politically conservative oldest child. `` I think it's going to hit us around September when we would be coming back to work _ the same as a retired athlete would say when the football season starts next year and I'm not in spring training,'' <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> said Sunday night at a party celebrating the <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> show. In the final, one-hour episode to be broadcast May 14, <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> fulfills his longtime dream of landing a job with a Wall Street brokerage firm and prepares to leave home. `` I will miss the entity of ` Family Ties,''' said <PERSON> Justine </PERSON> <PERSON> Bateman </PERSON>, who played <PERSON> Mallory </PERSON> <PERSON> Keaton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Alex </PERSON>'s sister whose main interests were fashion and shopping. `` It was an incredible chemical combination and reaction. I do n't think anyone remembers the recipe. Actually, the recipe was hard work, good work and just class and nice dispositions.'' The show, which debuted in September 1982, featured <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Gross </PERSON> as their father, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Keaton </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Meredith </PERSON> <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON> <PERSON> Birney </PERSON> as his wife, <PERSON> Elyse </PERSON>. The parents, former flower children of the 1960s, confronted the materialistic nature of <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mallory </PERSON>, and younger daughter <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON>'s struggle to grow up. <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON>, played by <PERSON> Tina </PERSON> <PERSON> Yothers </PERSON>, lost her role as baby of the family in the fifth season when son <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>, played by <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonsall </PERSON>, was born. While there was comedy, the show also tackled serious subjects such as teen-age pregnancy, death and divorce. The series, which often ranked among the highest rated shows, won three Emmy Awards for the 1986-87 season, including <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> as outstanding lead actor in a comedy series. An award for outstanding writing in a comedy series went to creator <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> and co-executive producer <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Uger </PERSON> for a special one-hour show, `` A, My Name is <PERSON> Alex </PERSON>,'' in which <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> struggled to cope with a friend's accidental death <PERSON> Gross </PERSON> said he will miss his character as well as the cast members. `` I've enjoyed <PERSON> Steven </PERSON>. It's been fun living with him,'' he said, `` and I hope I've even learned a few things from him _ patience and understanding and all those other things I have in a rather shorter supply than he does. But I'm going to miss my co-workers.''

<HEAD>MIT Department Heads Cast Doubt on Utah Fusion Experiment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> researchers who claim a major breakthrough in cold fusion apparently misinterpreted crucial data and may not have achieved fusion, according to two <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> scientists. In a paper they plan to present to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> tonight, the MIT scientists question the reported level of neutrons emitted during the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> experiment. A release of neutrons could be a sign that fusion was taking place. `` We're asserting that their neutron emission was below what they thought it was, including the possibilty that it could have been none at all,'' <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Plasma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fusion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said early today. <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> chemist <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southampton </ORGANIZATION> announced on March 23 they had produced fusion in a jar at room temperature The report has aroused hopes of a cheap and virtually limitless supply of clean energy, but it also has elicited skepticism from many scientists who doubt fusion could take place at anything but extremely high temperatures. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION> researchers have been working for weeks to verify the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> experiments, but their results did n't hold up when measured against a standard known as a Neutron Capture Gamma Spectrum. `` If -LRB- fusion -RRB- occurred at all, it was far below what they deduced from their measurements,'' <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said. Part of the problem, <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said, is that <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> did not directly measure the neutrons released in their experiment. `` The measurement they made was an indirect measurement, not of neutrons directly but of gamma rays produced by neutrons,'' <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said. `` The neutrons were taken by many to be an indication that real fusion was taking place,'' he said. `` And when you remove the neutrons or vastly lower their rate of emission, then I think this -LRB- lessens -RRB- the possibility that fusion has taken place. But does n't completely rule it out. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> conducted his research along with <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballinger </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION>'s Materials Science and Engineering and Nuclear Engineering departments. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> called their findings `` a warning to not accept all the claims at face value and not to expect that there's an overnight path to nirvana as far as energy is concerned.''

 The stand-in for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> at the bicentennial of his inauguration was an actor playing <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. And a descendant of the nation's first president who participated in the weekend's festivities is a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> trying to be an actor. Stern-faced <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> actor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sommerfield </PERSON>, who took the oath in Sunday's re-enactment of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s inauguration, tried to be as much like the nation's first president as possible even when crowds seemed unsure whether to laugh or applaud.

And more than once, he said, he's considered changing his last name so it will no longer be a factor. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said he began having mixed feelings about his heritage after he appeared in 1984 in a television miniseries about his uncle. He played <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s brother. `` The only reason I'd get in to see people is my agent would say, ` He's related to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>,''' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> recalled before a dinner-dance at the <LOCATION> Waldorf-Astoria </LOCATION> on Sunday night for descendants of presidents. He termed it `` bizarre nepotism.'' `` I was so humiliated,'' said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, who has appeared on television in small parts several times this year.

It was my impression people did n't care about <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> anymore.'' He said the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> name also did n't help some of his relatives.

<HEAD>Dollar Up Sharply, Nikkei Hits New High</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar closed sharply higher against the Japanese yen today despite central bank efforts to check its rise, and the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s key index finished at a new high. The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 79.82 points, or 0.24 percent, closing at 33,793.17. The index had gained 212.52 points to set a 33,713.35 record close on Friday. The dollar closed at 133.90 yen, up 1.41 yen from Friday's close of 132.49 yen. It opened at 133.00 yen and ranged between 132.98 yen and 133.90 yen. Traders said the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> bought about $ 300 million in efforts to brake the dollar's rise against the yen. But <PERSON> Minori </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeuchi </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> said the central bank's intervention encouraged dollar buying instead of pushing the currency down `` Until the <ORGANIZATION> BOJ </ORGANIZATION> intervened, trading was rather quiet, with little fluctuation in the rate,'' she said. `` Because the <ORGANIZATION> BOJ </ORGANIZATION>'s dollar-buying did n't work at all, investors were reconfirmed in their feeling of the dollar's strength and continued to buy it,'' Ms. <PERSON> Takeuchi </PERSON> added. She said the market's demand for the dollar is still strong because market players expect no immediate change in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic policies. On the stock market, <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> dealer <PERSON> Kenji </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishizuka </PERSON> said the market's main index rose in the afternoon session as institutional investors bought about 20,000 shares of each of the 225 issues in the index. He said reduced concerns about an immediate interest rise in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> encouraged buying. Media reports have said the central bank might raise its official interest rate by 0.5 percentage point to 3 percent, but many in the market now expect that this will not happen soon. Higher domestic interest rates generally discourage stock buying. Trading was relatively active, <PERSON> Ishizuka </PERSON> said, with first section volume estimated at 900 million shares. Friday's volume was 1.1 billion. Among the gainers were steel, ship building and supermarket issues. The markets will be open Tuesday, but then will close until next Monday for a series of national holidays known in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> as `` Golden Week.''

<HEAD>`Ghetto,' A Play by Joshua Sobol, Opens on Broadway</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS 3 grafs with comments from other critics; No PMs planned.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two months after 50,000 of the 70,000 Eastern European Jews living in the Vilna Ghetto of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> during World War II were slaughtered, a theater company was started by some of the survivors. It was an extraordinary event _ the founding of an artistic community at the height of the Holocaust to keep alive the spirits as well as the lives of those still trapped by its horrors. The story of the theater's birth in 1942 and its death two years later is told disjointedly in <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> <PERSON> Sobol </PERSON>'s `` Ghetto'' which opened Sunday at Broadway's Circle in the Square Theater. The play, even with the addition of songs and music, is heavy on philosophic discussion and short on dramatic continuity and character development. That might seem strange, considering the thousands of unspeakable tragedies that occurred in <LOCATION> Vilna </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Sobol </PERSON> is more concerned with historical events than individuals. The events _ some real and some imaginary _ are told in flashback by <PERSON> Srulik </PERSON>, a ventriloquist and the artistic director of the fabled theater. His remembrances make for some striking images but confusing story lines. Director <PERSON> Gedalia </PERSON> <PERSON> Besser </PERSON> captures the audience's attention immediately as Srulik, as an old man, sits on stage in a hospital wheelchair and remembers. Suddenly, the back wall falls, and mountains of bags containing the clothes of dead Jews tumble to the floor as a prison wall topped with barbed wire rises in its place. It's a mesmerizing beginning to the play, and an image that not's topped during the rest of the evening In the ghetto, <PERSON> Srulik </PERSON> carries a ventriloquist's dummy, played by a real actor, <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>. <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> is made up to look like the lascivious master of ceremonies in the musical `` Cabaret.'' The dummy is the one occupant of the ghetto who talks back to the Nazi officers, particularly the commandant, <PERSON> Kittel </PERSON>, played with sneering ferocity by <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> McHattie </PERSON>. It's <PERSON> Kittel </PERSON> who has the idea for the theater company, and he orders <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Gens </PERSON>, the Zionist leader of the Jewish police in the ghetto, to carry it out. The play eventually becomes an argument about the existence of the company between <PERSON> Gens </PERSON> and other members of the ghetto, particularly <PERSON> Hermann </PERSON> <PERSON> Kruk </PERSON>, founder of the ghetto library. <PERSON> Gens </PERSON> is a practical man who will sacrifice some Jews so others can be saved. If only Jews who work can be kept alive, he will give them jobs in the theater. But <PERSON> Kruk </PERSON> is appalled at the idea and proclaims, `` In a cemetery there can be no theater.'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearn </PERSON> as the realistic <PERSON> Gens </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jarlath </PERSON> <PERSON> Conroy </PERSON> as the more cultured <PERSON> Kruk </PERSON> enunciate their arguments well, but not much is learned about them from the play except their opposite stands on the theater company. <PERSON> Avner </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenberg </PERSON>, best known as the clown <PERSON> Avner </PERSON> the Eccentric, plays <PERSON> Srulik </PERSON>. He is n't given much of an opportunity to develop his character, even though the story is told through his eyes. Srulik serves primarily as an excuse for announcing the various excerpts of the company's theatrical productions which are shown only in brief segments. There are a few interesting characters, particularly a cabaret singer played with heart-breaking desperation by <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>. She sings the songs, both original numbers from the ghetto theater as well as new material written by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Schimmel </PERSON>, with authenticity. And <PERSON> Donal </PERSON> <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON> has some incisive moments as a tailor who helps organize workers to mend German uniforms and which helps keep them alive. <PERSON> Sobol </PERSON>'s play, translated by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lan </PERSON>, never develops dramatically once the ghetto residents establish the theater company. It goes from incident to incident without shedding more light on the characters or why they participated in it. The theater finally was closed down by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> in 1944, which the play depicts in a bloody and unsatisfactory finale. Even after more than two and a half hours, the audience is left wondering about the inhabitants of <LOCATION> Vilna </LOCATION>, marveling at their determination to survive, but wanting to know a lot more about what they were really like than `` Ghetto'' manages to tell. In other reviews, The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> said the presentation is lifeless and is `` aiding rather than combating historical amnesia.'' In the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissel </PERSON> said the play `` has moments in which harsh images come to life. But for long stretches it is curiously uninvolving.'' <PERSON> Clive </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, writing in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, said `` <PERSON> Sobol </PERSON> has theatricalized this fragmentary morality play with great skill.''

<HEAD>Safety No Longer Top Priority At Chernobyl, Soviet Official Laments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The local <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief is complaining that safety standards have eased at the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear power plant and well-trained specialists are in short supply at the facility. <PERSON> Grigory </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Revenko </PERSON>, first secretary of the <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> region, says in an article in Sunday's Pravda that workers still are searching for the best way to seal the plant's No. 4 reactor, which exploded and spewed radiation three years ago last week in the world's worst nuclear accident. After the April 26, 1986 accident, which killed at least 31 people, the reactor was encased in concrete to prevent further radiation leaks. <PERSON> Revenko </PERSON>, a Ukrainian who was recently elected to the new Soviet parliament, did not say why additional measures were needed to seal the reactor. While that work continues, however, `` Problems with the safe operation of the station more and more are being moved back to second priority,'' <PERSON> Revenko </PERSON> wrote in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily. `` The understanding of the acuteness of the problems, including those concerning the safety of the station, has dulled. We consider this unacceptable and demand decisive intervention by'' the government, he said. Other reactors at the plant are working and reportedly have generated more than 40 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity since the accident. <PERSON> Revenko </PERSON>, 53, said Chernobyl workers either have not received the equipment and high-quality spare parts they need or have received them after long delays. He also said scientists and technical specialists throughout the country are poorly coordinating their work on eliminating the accident's consequences. In addition, he said, the <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> is not sending enough workers capable of coping with the special problems at the plant. The three-column article said it was taking too long to build housing and other buildings for <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> plant workers in a new town, <LOCATION> Slavutich </LOCATION>, and that an off-limits, contaminated zone around the plant is being poorly managed. Recent Soviet news reports have said thousands more people will be evacuated because their land is contaminated by Chernobyl radiation and that deformed animals are routinely born on contaminated Ukrainian farms. The reports also have complained that despite the Kremlin's policy of greater openness, the government recently adopted a rule forbidding disclosure of the illnesses people suffer from <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> contamination Soviet public opinion turned against nuclear power after the accident, and several nuclear power projects have been scrapped around the country.

 Japanese and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ships searched off southwestern <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> today for two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sailors missing from a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> submarine after a wave washed them overboard while they were standing watch, officials said. A third sailor also washed overboard before dawn Sunday was spotted by a rescue plane and saved by his ship, the 2,145-ton <PERSON> Barbel </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liaison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. The rescued sailor's condition was not given, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military spokesman Master Gunnery Sgt. <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodrigues </PERSON> said he had no further information. `` The three crew members were standing watch on the sail during surface operations in international waters when the accident occurred at 2:30 a.m.,'' the statement said. <PERSON> Yoshikazu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakamura </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Maritime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s office in <LOCATION> Kagoshima </LOCATION> prefecture said there probably were numerous big waves at the time because a fog and strong-wind alert was in effect for the area. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> statement said the submarine was off <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s southernmost main island of <LOCATION> Kyushu </LOCATION>, about 650 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> <PERSON> Nakamura </PERSON> said there was no way to determine the height of any waves or the wind speed. <PERSON> Kiyoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Harada </PERSON>, a spokesman for the maritime agency, said three Japanese aircraft and four vessels, including three Japanese patrol boats, searched today for the missing sailors. A Japanese defense official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that before the accident, the submarine surfaced because it was taking on water from a hatch. He refused to elaborate. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman denied that. `` We have no information that there is anything wrong with the <PERSON> Barbel </PERSON>, and it is taking part in the search,'' Lt. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Gradeck </PERSON> said. The diesel-powered <PERSON> Barbel </PERSON>, built in 1956 and equipped with six torpedo tubes in its bow, has a crew of 77, said a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity. The official said the 219-foot <PERSON> Barbel </PERSON> belongs to the last class of non-nuclear combat submarines built by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Tens of Thousands March in Traditional May Day Parade</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL PUTZEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soviets marked May Day today with a parade through Red Square that focused on efforts to encourage economic growth, carry out competitive elections and clean up the environment. In its broadcast of the annual workers' celebrations, state-run television paid tribute to those killed in a pro-independence demonstration in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> last month as well as to the victims of the Armenian earthquake and a fire aboard a nuclear submarine. No parades were held in the Armenian and <LOCATION> Georgian </LOCATION> capitals this May Day out of respect for the dead, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the mood was upbeat and the weather was balmy and bright, with the emphasis on progress and only general references to international issues, such as signs extolling peace. President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and members of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling Politburo stood atop <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION>'s tomb to view the festivities as thousands upon thousands of marchers passed through Red Square waving banners, pushing floats and releasing helium-filled balloons. <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the president's wife, was nowhere to be seen. The <PERSON> Gorbachevs </PERSON>' daughter, <PERSON> Irina </PERSON>, and granddaughter, <PERSON> Oksana </PERSON>, were in a stand reserved for VIPs. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON> and other Western diplomats who boycotted the parade to protest the 1979 Soviet intervention in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> were in their places with the diplomatic corps today. They returned last year after the Soviets announced they would withdraw their troops _ a withdrawal completed in February. In a section reserved for government dignitaries stood <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, the Communist leader ousted from his post as <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party boss and removed from the Politburo but elected to represent the Soviet capital in the new parliament that meets May 25. Also present were members of a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> delegation in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to prepare for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> this month for the first Soviet-Chinese summit in 30 years. The May Day parade, unlike the one each Revolution Day, Nov. 7, is not a military affair, but Soviet television interviewed a missile commander on the square, Col. Gen. <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yashin </PERSON>, who said defense industries now devote 40 percent of their production to making consumer goods for civilians and plan to increase that share to 60 percent in coming years. `` It's mostly things like refrigerators, cars, washing machines, agricultural machinery,'' <PERSON> Yashin </PERSON> said, reflecting official policy to commit more resources to producing consumer goods for a product-starved domestic market. He said the Soviets have destroyed 860 missiles under the U.S.-Soviet treaty to eliminate intermediate-range nuclear weapons. <PERSON> Yashin </PERSON> also said the first military bases, covering nearly 10,000 acres, have been turned over to the civil sector for farming. Hundreds of signs and red banners held aloft by what <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said were 150,000 marchers stressed the virtue of work. The signs carried by the marchers also boosted perestroika, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s program to modernize Soviet society; a campaign to make the Communist state a nation of laws; and recent parliamentary elections for the new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> Also this year, there was increased attention to environmental concerns. `` To the coming generations: a clean planet,'' pledged one banner. Access to Red Square is severely restricted for such events, and the vast majority of Soviets who saw the two-hour parade did so on television, which augmented its coverage with prerecorded segments, including one on the importance of cleaning up the water supply and conserving natural resources.

The accident occurred when a train loaded with 15 riders failed to slow enough as it was returning to the loading zone. It bumped into another train loaded with 20 people, said <PERSON> Rohman </PERSON>. The $ 2 million ride carried an estimated 7,000 people Saturday, the first day the park was open this season, <PERSON> Rohman </PERSON> said.

 As a teen-ager in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> during World War II, <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> <PERSON> Opdyke </PERSON> risked death at the hands of the Gestapo by hiding 12 Jewish friends in the basement and attic of a German officer's villa where she worked All survived the Holocaust, as did countless others who were saved because Mrs. <PERSON> Opdyke </PERSON> shared information overheard from <LOCATION> Gestapo </LOCATION> officers planning roundups in Jewish communities. Last week, an old war debt was repaid. Administrators at the Jewish Home for the Aged in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> community of <LOCATION> Reseda </LOCATION> waived admissions policies and admitted Ms. <PERSON> Opdyke </PERSON>'s 80-year-old husband, <PERSON> William </PERSON>, to their Alzheimer's disease unit. `` We violated all the rules _ he's not from our region, we are sectarian, we are so short of beds _ but there are certain times when there are no rules. This is one of those times,'' Executive Director <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Blumenthal </PERSON> said. `` In caring for <PERSON> Bill </PERSON>, we are repaying a debt to her. We owe her.'' <PERSON> Opdyke </PERSON> is one of only a few non-Jews at the 875-bed facility that provides communal living for old people. Mrs. <PERSON> Opdyke </PERSON>, 68, said she vowed to help her Jewish friends when she saw the way <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s army treated Jews during the 1939 invasion of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. She called it `` a nightmare that changed my life.'' `` I saw a man with a white beard and a little white hat, running carrying a Torah,'' she said. `` Little ones were screaming ` Mama! Mama!' I saw a soldier pull a baby out of its mother's arms and throw him to the ground. Later, I heard shooting. They were killing innocent people.'' While working as a housekeeping for a German major, she hid Jewish friends for nearly eight months, sometimes in the home's attic, other times in the basement Recently, as Ms. <PERSON> Opdyke </PERSON>'s husband began suffering from the advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease, administrators at the Jewish Home for the Aged said they felt a special obligation to care for him. `` She risked her life and this is the return we want to give her,'' said <PERSON> Dena </PERSON> <PERSON> Schulman </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the home.

<TEXT>
 The death toll from the tornado that ripped through central <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> passed 800 today when searchers found 14 bodies in the ruins of houses and two other people died of injuries, officials said. They said the bodies were found in the district of <LOCATION> Manikganj </LOCATION>, 25 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Dakar </LOCATION>, which bore the brunt of the storm. At least two people critically injured by the tornado died in <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Tornado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Room </ORGANIZATION> said. They spoke on condition of anonymity. The deaths increased the number of people killed to 802. At least 12,000 people were injured and 130,000 left homeless after the tornado raged through <LOCATION> Manikganj </LOCATION> on Wednesday night, sending people, houses, trees and electric poles flying. Residents say the storm caused more than 1,000 deaths because 400 people officially listed as missing are feared killed. Survivors face shortges of drinking water, food and medicines, rescue officials said. `` Diarrhea may spread in an epidemic form unless supply of pure drinking water improves,'' one official said on condition of anonymity. He said at least 100 people have been treated for diarrhea. `` Decomposing bodies lying in pools and ponds have polluted the water,'' said relief worker <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasim </PERSON>. At least 300 wells have been drilled in <LOCATION> Manikganj </LOCATION> district to supply safe water and another 100 will be sunk in the next few days, officials said. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> announced aid of $ 85,000 for tornado victims, the government-owned news agency <ORGANIZATION> Bangladesh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sangbad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sanstha </ORGANIZATION> reported. And <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is sending a plane with relief supplies, it said. The tornado, accompanied by hailstones and showers, came hours after President <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> led nationwide prayers for rains to ease a two-month-long drought. The drought threatened to destroy half the 5.6 million ton spring crop in the ground, <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials said. Agriculture, almost entirely dependent on rainfall, is the main occupation of most of the nation's 110 million people. <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, one of the world's poorest countries with an average annual income of $ 160 a person, alternates between flood and drought. Summer floods last year left four-fifths of the country under water and killed at least 1,400 people. In November, cyclones claimed another 1,100 lives.

<TEXT>
 Eight leaders of underground political groups remained in custody today, a day after being arrested while selling their magazines on the Arbat pedestrian mall, an activist said. The eight dissidents probably will stay under `` preventive arrest'' through the two-day May Day holiday that ends Tuesday, said <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Mityunov </PERSON>, a member of the self-styled opposition party <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. Leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, Express-Chronicle, Free Migration, Debate, and Trust groups were detained Sunday after ignoring police calls to disperse. `` Down with the fascists!'' one man yelled at police as they grabbed the activists. In their publications and in telephone calls to Western reporters, the groups declared Sunday a `` samizdat holiday.'' `` Samizdat'' is Russian for self-published and is used to describe underground newspapers and magazines. On Sunday, the dissidents perched atop concrete planters outside the Vakhtangov theater on Arbat Street, silently holding makeshift bulletin boards bearing copies of their publications. Thousands of onlookers strolled along the mall in the 70 degree weather and peeked at the publications. The most sensational of the newspapers was a copy of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily Pravda that had pasted to it cartoons lampooning Soviet founder <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>. One cartoon portrayed <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> as a devil. A policeman announced through a megaphone that the gathering was not sanctioned, and he ordered the dissidents to disperse. About 15 minutes later, officers moved in. The Democratic Union, formed in May, seeks multiparty elections, independent trade unions, a new constitution and the withdrawal of Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Oceanographers have recovered <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>, the errant submersible robot that took a dive last week, but have decided to give its understudy, Medea, the starring role in an underwater show. <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>, a high-tech, propeller-driven submersible equipped with video cameras and maneuverable arms, was retrieved from the bottom of the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> on Saturday. It sank 2,100 feet to the ocean floor Wednesday when its cable to the support ship Star Hercules snapped. Meanwhile, the submersible Medea, which was used to recover <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>, was expected to take center stage today as the first of 250,000 students in 12 cities across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> hook up via two-way satellite with marine explorers off the coast of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. Over the next two weeks, museum officials and elementary and high school students will watch via satellite as <PERSON> Medea </PERSON> inspects the wreckage of a sunken Spanish galleon. Medea is a six-foot-long, one-ton platform carrying three television cameras, two color and one black-and-white. Unlike <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>, it is not remotely operated with its own propulsion system; it is towed behind a surface craft and its cameras operate as it passes a target. Organizers had hoped <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> would be able to go on with the show, but <PERSON> Sonya </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagopian </PERSON> of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, a sponsor of the program, said <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> will undergo a complete evaluation before returning to service. `` <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> will probably be going back in, but not right away,'' <PERSON> Hagopian </PERSON> said Sunday from <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION>. `` It could be a matter of just a few days.'' About 2,000 museum officials, teachers and technicians were testing a satellite hookup last week when <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>, the younger brother of the robot that first rummaged through the Titanic's wreckage, unceremoneously sank on its debut mission <PERSON> Hagopian </PERSON> said that while most of the damage to <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> appeared to be cosmetic, technicians planned to run it through a series of tests before returning it to the water. `` I understand that there is minimal damage to it. It is still very usable. It's not bad at all,'' she said. `` On a scale of one to 10, with one being minimal damage, I'd say we're at a one.'' The May 1-14 project's sponsors include <ORGANIZATION> Woods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hole </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION>.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Syrian and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> forces battled with mortar and tank fire in the hills above <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> today, killing two people and wounding seven, the first casualties in a 3-day-old truce called by the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. Fighting raged from nightfall Sunday to daybreak today in the mountaintop town of <LOCATION> Souk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> el-Gharb </LOCATION>, where Syrian troops and Druse militiamen surrounded a Christian army garrison, police said. Mortar and tank cannon rounds crashed in Christian and Druse villages around Souk el-Gharb, wounding seven villagers, police said. Two Lebanese soldiers also died in the fighting, the first fatalities reported by officials since a truce went into effect Friday in an Arab League-mediated attempt to halt eight weeks of bloodshed. `` This is the gravest violation of the truce. It's worse than the sporadic bombardment of the coastline of the Christian enclave in the past two days,'' according to a police spokesman said. `` The coastal shelling underlined the dispute over blockaded seaports, but the fighting in <LOCATION> Souk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> el-Gharb </LOCATION> has wider dimensions that could undermine the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>'s peace plan altogether,'' he said. He spoke on condition of anonymity. Souk el-Gharb sits atop a strategic network of mountain roads leading from the Druse hinterland southeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to the Christian heartland north and northeast of the capital. If the Christian-controlled town falls to the allied Syrians and Druse, Christians would lose the central mountain stronghold shielding their 310-square-mile enclave. The latest casualties increased the overall toll to 275 people killed and 1,000 wounded since March 6, when army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s 20,000 mainly Christian troops blocked illegal Moslem militia-run ports. The Syrian-Druse alliance responded by blockading the Christian enclave. A spokesman at <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s command claimed the Syrian army and militiamen of Druse warlord <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> were `` trying to provoke us into a mass retaliation to undermine the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>'s cease-fire.'' `` But the general is determined to strip them from that excuse. We're not responding,'' said the spokesman, who requested anonymity. He said <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s army was merely defending front positions and was not shelling Moslem residential areas or distant Syrian targets. <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>, meanwhile, issued a May Day statement calling for <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s removal from power as a condition for peace. `` It's impossible to reach a compromise with <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. He must be removed or toppled,'' said <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>. `` This must be clear to all other <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> leaderships.'' The political and military wrangling underlined a dispute over the second provision of the latest cease-fire that calls for the lifting of air, land and sea blockades. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who heads a <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> military Cabinet in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s dual government, refused to call off the blockade of illegal harbors, which he says deprive the state of $ 100 million yearly in lost taxes. He said his gunboats and helicopter gunships were applying Lebanese laws. But the rival Moslem Cabinet under acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> has insisted <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s blockade be lifted.

 Student protest leaders today denounced meetings government officials held with students as insincere attempts to placate the students without seriously addressing the democratic reforms they seek. Several student leaders, meanwhile, said they have been warned to stop planning a protest Thursday, the 70th anniversary of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s first democratic movement. Two Cabinet ministers met students today, the third day of meetings to discuss student demands for reforms including a free press and an end to official privileges and corruption. Some students complained the government has snubbed their independent group, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Universities </ORGANIZATION>, by refusing to allow it to represent the student movement in the talks. The government says the group is illegal. `` We do n't recognize this ` dialogue,''' said a spokesman for the group, which has been leading two weeks of protests including the largest protest marches in 40 years of communist rule and a week-old class boycott. `` We demand a dialogue based on the principles of equality and openness, conducted directly between democratically chosen student representatives and government decision-makers,'' he said at a news conference. The student did not want his name used for fear of government reprisals. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>, a student leader at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's most prestigious school, called for establishment of a nationwide independent student group and indefinite continuation of the class boycott by about 75,000 students in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and nearby <LOCATION> Tianjin </LOCATION> On Monday, the minister of metallurgical industry, <PERSON> Qi </PERSON> <PERSON> Yuanjing </PERSON>, met students at the <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, and Minister of the <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Astronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Lin </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhongtang </PERSON>, met students from the <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, state-run radio reported. Officials acknowledged to students that government decisions often are made too quickly and without sufficient study, the radio reported. At the first meetings, the government selected 45 students to meet Education Minister He Dongchang and other senior officials Saturday and 29 students to meet Sunday with <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Xitong </PERSON> and city party chief <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Ximing </PERSON>. Officials at the meetings insisted they share students' opposition to worsening corruption, but urged them to `` calm down,'' halt plans for new marches and end the class boycott The Guangming Daily, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s national newspaper for intellectuals, praised the meetings as expressions of `` socialist democracy'' and channels for `` clearing up misunderstandings and suspicion.'' Students, however, complained they were only allowed to ask questions and there was no give-and-take. `` The government answers to student questions illustrated their lack of sincerity,'' the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. He accused the government of trying to `` deceive public opinion'' by making an appearance of conceding to student demands. `` Students, we risked bloodshed and danger to get as far as we have!'' said a poster at the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` Please continue your efforts.'' <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, marked the international labor holiday May Day today by appealing to workers in editorials and speeches to resist `` forces of instability.'' So far there has been no large-scale organized support among workers for the student marches. But workers have cheered on student protesters and voiced support for demands for an end to official corruption. Although the government toned down its initial harsh criticism of the student movement after tens of thousands of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> citizens applauded a student march Thursday, it has continued to claim an unspecified `` handful of people'' are illegally plotting revolution.

 Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said today he had a productive meeting with <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> resistance leader Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, but the two did not broach the subject of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid. `` It was a good meeting,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said after the 45-minute session with <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>. `` I had not met him before.' Aides to the vice president arranged the meeting with <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> after learning that the two would be in <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION> at the same time. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who arrived here today after five days in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, also held discussions throughout the day with a host of Indonesians, including President <PERSON> Suharto </PERSON> and three human rights activists. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said that in his meeting with <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, he did not talk about the possibility of providing military assistance to <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> resistance forces, although that option is under consideration in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` We talked about the process and moving the process forward and what coalition may or may not be, who the players are and what some of the expectations would be,'' the vice president told reporters. <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s future _ and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy toward the country _ is one of the top items on <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s agenda during his 12-day trip to the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> region. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has said it plans to end its military occupation of its <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> neighbor this fall. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> supports having <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> lead an interim government until elections can be scheduled in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. Others jockeying to run the country include factions led by <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>, the head of the Vietnamese puppet government in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and an anti-communist group headed by <PERSON> Son </PERSON> <PERSON> Sann </PERSON>. Both <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Son </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sann </LOCATION> were in <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION> for meetings with <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>. While the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has yet to clearly define its policy toward <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and his aides have firmly rejected a takeover by the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, the Chinese-backed group that was responsible for killing as many as 1.5 million people in the late 1970s. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> has called for an international conference in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> that would devise an enforcement mechanism for the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops and the transition toward an elected government. A senior aide to <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said that in his meetings with <PERSON> Suharto </PERSON>, the vice president reiterated that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants to follow the lead of its Asian allies in devising its policy toward <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> does not want to do `` anything that is counterproductive,'' said the aide, who asked to remain anonymous. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> also discussed trade with the <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> leader and said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is interested in human rights issues such as the situation in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Timor </LOCATION>, a former <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> colony annexed by <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> in 1975. While the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> views <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> as a reliable ally, it wants to see <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION> develop more openness on the political side as well as economically. Underscoring his commitment to human rights, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> met with three local activists to hear their concerns. The vice president did not agree with all of the activists' issues, but he `` listened and received material about individual cases'' of alleged human rights abuses, the <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> aide said. More than 30 members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> asked the vice president last week to raise the human rights issue with the Indonesians, especially to pursue reports that the country is holding as many as 400 political prisoners. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>, leaves for <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> on Tuesday before heading to <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, where he will view the cleanup operation from the devastating March 24 oil spill of the tanker <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON>.

 <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials abroad approve most of the orders to kill Arabs suspected of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> after underground `` trials'' are conducted by local <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> activists, <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> sources said today. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> had no immediate comment on the report. In the latest attack on an alleged collaborator, <PERSON> Ahed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramini </PERSON>, a 30-year-old Palestinian, was fatally stabbed today by attackers in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. His death brought to 41 the number of alleged collaborators killed since the Palestinian uprising began nearly 16 months ago, most the victims of attackers who support the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. More than 60 alleged collaborators have been wounded. In recent weeks, the Palestinian underground has established a clandestine system to conduct what they say are trials of those accused of cooperating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s military government in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Palestinian sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the so-called trials included testimony from witnesses, and that notes or tape recordings were made of the proceedings. `` As the Palestinian organization becomes more disciplined, there have been situations where people have been pulled in and questioned. Testimony has been taken as well as confessions, which are tape recorded and signed,'' said one Palestinian believed to have close contacts with underground activists. On the basis of such statements, recommendations were forwarded to <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials abroad, said another source, adding that a `` black list'' had been compiled of Palestinians who informed or worked with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> military authorities. The Palestinian sources said the orders to kill the alleged collaborators were approved by a Moslem clergyman who was deported by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> in 1980 and is now believed to be based in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The sources said orders are relayed via coded messages broadcast by <ORGANIZATION> Baghdad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>. An Israeli military official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> had encouraged and cooperated in attacks on Palestinians who had dealings with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> or adopted anti-PLO positions. He also confirmed the clergyman was involved in approving such reprisals. According to Israeli government figures, 960 attacks were carried out between December 1987 and mid-April, most of them warnings such as firebombs hurled at houses or cars. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> said there was a `` wave of terror'' being waged to intimidate moderates who might otherwise support <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s proposal to hold elections in the occupied territories to choose Palestinian negotiators. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Alon </PERSON> <PERSON> Liel </PERSON> told reporters April was the bloodiest month for Palestinian attacks on Palestinians with at least 10 killed. He was unable to cite evidence that <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> were killed for political beliefs but contended the attacks had a chilling effect on diplomatic efforts. `` It is impossible to convince people to start working on the elections in this atmosphere,'' <PERSON> Liel </PERSON> said, confirming newspaper reports that <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> complained to <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> that terror was being used to thwart <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s attempts to find <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> partners for dialogue. Palestinians denied the killings were designed to rein in dissidents and said collaborators were punished because they endangered the lives of underground activists who were sought by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities. One source said the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Uprising </ORGANIZATION>, which guides the revolt against Israeli occupation, had issued an internal memo recently stressing that no reprisals could be taken against collaborators without permission of the underground. `` If anything, there are less attacks as a result,'' said one Palestinian. A leaflet distributed in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> today and signed by <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> faction, vowed to `` strangle anyone who will think of interfering with the intefadeh -LRB- uprising -RRB- and those who collaborate.''

 Technicians today replaced two faulty fuel system parts aboard space shuttle Atlantis, and <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> hoped to be able to reschedule the once-aborted launch attempt for as early as Thursday. Space agency spokeswoman <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> said a new pump and 4-inch fuel line were installed and were being prepared for pressure, leak and other checks. `` The work is going very well,'' she said today. Shuttle managers scheduled a meeting this afternoon to consider a new launch date. Earlier they had said the earliest possible liftoff date was Friday, but with the work progressing smoothly they said today that a Thursday afternoon liftoff was a possibility. Because of the shifting positions of <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>, there is only a 32-day launch opportunity for sending the $ 550 million <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> spacecraft in Atlantis' cargo bay toward <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>. If the shuttle ca n't get off the ground by May 28, the mission would have to be put off for two years, at a cost of $ 100 million, until the two planets are again aligned properly. The launch was scrubbed last Friday just 31 seconds before the planned liftoff when controllers noted a sudden power surge on a fuel pump that recirculates liquid hydrogen propellant for one of the three main engines. Engineers later discovered a tiny leak in a 4-inch-diameter fuel line that carries hydrogen from the external fuel tank to the shuttle. Had the countdown continued, a computer designed to detect such problems would have stopped the engines from firing and the five astronauts would have been safe, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. Workers on Sunday erected scaffolding and platforms around Atlantis, removed access panels and unhooked, insulation, wiring and other equipment as they began removing the bad parts. Two of the astronauts, commander <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> and pilot <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Grabe </PERSON>, practiced shuttle landings in a training aircraft Sunday and then flew to their home base in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. Mission specialists <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleave </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Thagard </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> on Saturday. At the <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, the astronauts will keep sharp by rehearsing aspects of the flight in a shuttle simulator. Six hours after launching the astronauts are to release the Magellan from Atlantis' cargo bay, starting it on a 450-day journey to <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>. The 7,600-pound craft is to orbit the planet and map up to 90 percent of its cloud-veiled surface with a high resolution radar system. The images, relayed to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and enhanced by computer, could tell scientists much about the history of <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> and why it evolved so differently than its sister planet <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Paraguayans voted today for a president and congress to replace the 34-year regime of Gen. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, who was toppled in a Feb. 3 coup. Gen. <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, the candidate of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the man who ousted <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, was expected to easily defeat former exile <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Laino </PERSON> and six other rivals. The <ORGANIZATION> Colorados </ORGANIZATION> were expected to retain control of congress. <PERSON> Laino </PERSON> denounced election irregularities, such as a lack of indelible ink at some stations to prevent double voting and a voter registration list that favored the ruling party. But he said this morning that some flaws were unavoidable and if fraud was not `` generalized'' his party, the country's second biggest, would accept the results. Voters interviewed shortly after polls opened at 7 a.m. -LRB- 8 a.m. EDT -RRB- said the elections were as free as any they had voted in. Voting was conducted in privacy and the ballots of all eight parties were available, said architect <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Facetti </PERSON>. `` That did n't use to happen'' in the days when Paraguayans were encouraged to vote for <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` Before, I would n't even have talked with you. What if a policeman saw?'' said <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, 57, a retired public accountant. `` Now the atmosphere is completely different.'' Polls indicate <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> will receive as much as 70 percent of the vote. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, 76, seized power in a 1954 coup and brooked little opposition during his lengthy rule, arranging to be elected every five years. He was unseated on Feb. 3 and sent into Brazilian exile. The 65-year-old <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> has been hailed by Paraguayans for toppling <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, but opposition parties _ banned under <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> _ have complained they were not given enough time to prepare for today's elections. Eight parties have fielded candidates in the voting for president, 36 senators and 72 deputies to finish the five-year terms begun by <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> and congress following elections in February 1988. The parties are responsible for providing their own ballots and presidential candidate <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Vera </PERSON> said his opposition <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Febrerista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was not sure its ballots would be available at all of the more than 10,000 polling places nationwide. `` We've distributed our ballots to the main places, but I'm not sure we've gotten through'' to smaller, more remote villages in the nation of 4 million, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has controlled the government for 42 years and <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> has broadened his base by improving relations among its factions as well as with foreign governments and the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, to which most Paraguayans at least nominally belong. At a campaign rally Saturday night, <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> repeated his pledge to complete only <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s term and to hand over power in August 1993 to `` my successor, freely elected by the people at the ballot box.'' The opposition contends the <ORGANIZATION> Colorados </ORGANIZATION> will benefit from dated voter registration lists. Even the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> says that up to 600,000 names on the list of 2.2 million may be invalid. The main campaign issue has been who can best move a country that has never had a democratic government in that direction. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> has broadened civil liberties and pledged to reform the constitution, electoral laws and penal code. The polls were to open at 7 a.m. and close at 4 p.m. with unofficial results expected tonight. Paraguayans ages 18 to 60 are required by law to vote. Violators face small fines.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> celebrated an open air Mass in an impoverished farming region today and said that despite tough economic times the faithful should not use artificial birth control. `` While it appears necessary to be aware of family planning, couples ... should use natural methods,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> told the 100,000 people who gathered for the Mass. The <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> approves only what it calls natural family planning, or abstinence during a woman's fertile period. Many Western nations have pressured Third World countries to control their population explosions, which hinder economic growth and are a chief factor in environmental degradation. The pope said that although the church's teachings seem difficult, natural methods will work and the faithful should reject `` contraceptive imperialism.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> arrived 90 minutes late for his last Mass on this <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> island. Fog had closed the airport 240 miles south of the capital of <LOCATION> Antananarivo </LOCATION>. After the Mass, the pope flew back to the capital and boarded an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Madagascar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 for the hour's flight to the French island of Reunion, the second of four stops on his fifth African tour. On Tuesday he travels to <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> then <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Didier </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratsiraka </PERSON> called the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>'s visit `` a source of comfort for those who are suffering'' in this impoverished country. In <LOCATION> Fianarantsoa </LOCATION>, the pope blessed 100 lepers who kneeled in a sandy field near the airport before saying Mass from a raised, wooden altar covered by a canopy. The pope today spoke of the serious environmental problems facing <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION> and other developing countries and reaffirmed his call Sunday for an international effort to safeguard the environment. `` From the north to the south of your great island, I have been able to admire the beauty, diverse richness of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and its fruit. And yet the way it is being used risks its degradation and sterilization.'' Saving this 225,000-square-mile island that split from the African mainland more than 150 million years ago has become a priority of many international environmental groups. Ninety percent of the island's plants and animals are found nowhere else, including hundreds of species of orchids and 29 species of lemurs, small primates whose name derives from the Latin word for ghost because of their nocturnal habits. The destructive farming methods of the island's population, constantly seeking fresh terrain to plant rice and other crops, has caused widespread deforestation. The <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> channel, off the island's west coast, is so red from the infusion of soil washed in by erosion that it is clearly recognizable to astronauts circling the globe. On Sunday, the pope spoke on the environmental threat to a gathering of foreign diplomats. He said he supports international efforts to halt the dumping of toxic wastes in poor countries and development that endangers the world's remaining rain forests. Also Sunday, the pontiff beatified a Malagasy woman credited with keeping the faith alive 100 years ago after the queen had banned all Roman Catholic services. Beatification is a first step toward possible sainthood. The church has been openly critical of <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION>'s government. Since a communist revolution in 1975, the country's economy has declined and recently, the government made policy alterations to assure foreign aid.

<HEAD>Justices to Study Michigan Campaign Spending Law</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to restudy, in a case involving the <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, what limits should be placed on campaign spending by political groups that incorporate themselves. The court said it will hear an appeal by <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> officials that is supported by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> has about 8,000 dues-paying members, about three-fourths of them corporations. The chamber planned in 1985 to place a paid advertisement in the Grand Rapids Press in support of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bandstra </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate for the state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>. Fearing the ad would be considered illegal under <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s Campaign Finance Act, the business group filed a federal lawsuit seeking to have the law declared unconstitutional The chamber said the act violates its free-speech rights. The state law generally prohibits corporations from spending in behalf of political candidates and carries a maximum $ 10,000 fine. The law permits a corporation to make such expenditures if it sets up a special fund, or political action committee, that is required to keep records and disclose the names of contributors. The <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> has such a fund. However, it wanted to pay for the newspaper ad for <PERSON> Bandstra </PERSON> out of its general treasury, which is exempt from the record-keeping and reporting requirements of the state campaign finance law. A federal judge ruled that the chamber may not spend money from its general treasury in behalf of a political candidate. The judge said the state campaign finance act, aimed at heading off corruption of the political process, applied to the chamber's activities But the 6th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> last September overturned the judge's decision. `` We conclude that indirect expenditures made by a non-traditional corporation, like the <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, formed for essentially ideological purposes and to disseminate economic and political ideas and not to amass capital, do not pose the threat or appearance of corruption,'' the appeals court said. The appeals court relied heavily on a 1986 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision limiting the federal government's power to regulate corporate political spending. The justices said then that the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 violates freedom of speech when applied to corporations formed primarily to influence public opinion, not to make a profit. The high court ruled in favor of a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> group formed to protest the legalization of abortion. The 1986 ruling said corporations formed to promote political ideas, that have no shareholders and are not established by business corporations or labor unions, should not be subject to the federal campaign spending law. The 6th Circuit court said the <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> fits that description. The appeals court also said there was no danger the chamber's corporate members will use the business group `` as a conduit for massive undisclosed corporate political spending. Anyone contributing more than $ 100 to a political candidate _ through the chamber or otherwise _ still must file a report disclosing that spending under state law, the appeals court said. In a dissenting opinion, Judge <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Merritt </PERSON> said the ruling allows corporate giants, such as <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>, to funnel large sums of money through the chamber to favorite candidates without revealing the spending. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> joined <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> officials in urging the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to overturn the appeals court ruling. The decision, if applied to federal law, `` would substantially undermine congressionally mandated limitations upon the use of corporate wealth to influence the outcome of federal elections,'' the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> said. The case is <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, 88-1569.

 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sailor who disappeared from a military base in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION> nine months ago was found alive today, hours after her father made a televised appeal for information on her fate, Italian authorities said.

<HEAD>Court to Study Goodyear's Use of Foreign Laws to Ease Tax Bite</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to hear a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration appeal aimed at allowing the government to collect potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes from multinational corporations. In a case involving <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the court said it will review a ruling that allows multinationals to use foreign tax laws to reduce their <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> taxes. The case stems from operations of <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION>'s British subsidiary in the early 1970s. The Ohio-based corporation's subsidiary incurred net losses in 1972 and 1973 _ at least under British tax law. The subsidiary's 1973 loss included British tax deductions that were not allowed under American tax law As a result, the British government refunded to the subsidiary the tax payments it made there for 1970 and 1971. The refunds prompted the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to recompute the taxes it said <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> owed in this country. Multinationals are entitled to claim a share of taxes paid by subsidiaries overseas as credits against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> taxes. In the <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> case, since American law did not recognize the 1973 deductions permitted the company in <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> the corporation's loss was converted into a profit. The redetermination had the further effect of wiping out, for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tax purposes, the foreign tax credits previously allowed in 1970 and 1971. As a result, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> assessed <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> $ 791,240 in taxes and interest for 1970 and 1971. <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> then sued in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Claims </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, saying the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> erred in applying American law instead of British law to determine the company's accumulated profits. The claims court ruled against <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION>. But a federal appeals court here reversed the decision last August. The appeals court said a multinational company is entitled to use a foreign nation's tax laws to determine accumulated profits made by a subsidiary in that country. Administration officials said the ruling could have `` enormous importance'' for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tax revenues. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers, in the appeal acted on today, said more than 25,000 foreign subsidiaries of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies are doing business in more than 100 countries. The government said its most recent figures show the companies claimed more than $ 9 billion in foreign tax credits in 1982. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> is reviewing $ 150 million in claimed refunds in such cases and expects the appeals court ruling will prompt an additional $ 750 million in refund claims. The government appeal conceded that the impact of the appeals court ruling has been blunted by a 1986 change in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tax law that may mean multinationals no longer will be able to use a foreign country's calculation of its accumulated profits for most future tax payments here. The case is <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION>, 88-1474.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Looks At Synanon Tax Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today appeared to clear the way for a federal trial against nine current and former <ORGANIZATION> Synanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> figures accused of illegally conspiring to regain the group's tax-exempt status. The justices sent the case back to a federal appeals court for restudy in light of their March 28 ruling that criminal defendants may not immediately appeal a judge's refusal to dismiss an indictment for alleged grand jury abuses by prosecutors. The <ORGANIZATION> Synanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> figures had sought to throw out an indictment that charges them with destroying evidence of violent activities at the California-based organization. The defendants said the 1985 indictment should be dismissed because of prosecutorial misconduct. <ORGANIZATION> Synanon </ORGANIZATION> was founded by <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Dederich </PERSON> some 30 years ago as a non-profit center for rehabilitating drug and alcohol users. In the late 1970s it became embroiled in allegations of violence, threats, and harassment of former members and opponents. <PERSON> Dederich </PERSON> has been accused of converting the organization into a violent cult. In October 1978, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Morantz </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> lawyer representing two former <ORGANIZATION> Synanon </ORGANIZATION> members in a suit against <ORGANIZATION> Synanon </ORGANIZATION>, was bitten by a rattlesnake he found in his mailbox. <PERSON> Dederich </PERSON> and two other <ORGANIZATION> Synanon </ORGANIZATION> members pleaded no contest to charges of conspiracy to murder <PERSON> Morantz </PERSON>. The indictment involved in the case acted on today did not name <PERSON> Dederich </PERSON>. But it said nine others, including his daughter, <PERSON> Cecelia </PERSON> <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Dederich </PERSON>, altered or destroyed evidence that could undermine <ORGANIZATION> Synanon </ORGANIZATION>'s claim to be a charitable, non-violent foundation. The indictment said they plotted to deceive the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which had revoked <ORGANIZATION> Synanon </ORGANIZATION>'s tax-exempt status. The foundation, later called <ORGANIZATION> Synanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, faces millions of dollars in tax liens. The indictment said destroyed documents and tapes had evidence of violence against perceived enemies of <ORGANIZATION> Synanon </ORGANIZATION>, acquisition of an arsenal of guns, diversion of <ORGANIZATION> Synanon </ORGANIZATION> money into private hands and so-called `` love matches'' and other activities of sexual promiscuity. The nine defendants said the government engaged in misconduct by using <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> Professor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ofshe </PERSON> as a witness before the grand jury that indicted them. The grand jury was not told that <PERSON> Ofshe </PERSON> was suing <ORGANIZATION> Synanon </ORGANIZATION> for millions of dollars and that <PERSON> Ofshe </PERSON> was allowed to listen to tape recordings to help identify individuals who were indicted, the defendants said. The 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> last July said, `` The prosecutor's failure to disclose <PERSON> Ofshe </PERSON>'s source of potential bias was a breach of duty to the grand jury. However, it does not by itself justify dismissal of the indictment.'' The other defendants named in the indictment are <ORGANIZATION> Synanon </ORGANIZATION> counsel <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourdette </PERSON>, former counsel <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Missakian </PERSON>, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Miriam </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourdette </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorkin </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Sybil </PERSON> <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON>. The case is <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 88-1290.

<HEAD>Court Lets Stand Licensing Fees for Nuclear Plants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today allowed the government to impose annual licensing fees of around $ 1 million for nuclear power plants. The justices, without comment, rejected an appeal by 29 companies that own or operate nuclear reactors. The licensing fee for nuclear plants was adopted by the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> under a 1986 budget bill passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The measure, the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, authorizes the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> to pay for one-third of its annual budget by assessing such fees. The commission imposed a fee of $ 950,000 last year on each holder of a nuclear plant license. The fee is expected to be more than $ 1 million for the current fiscal year. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> here upheld the fee last May. The appeals court rejected arguments that the fee should be tied directly to services the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> performs for the benefit of a particular nuclear plant. The appeals court also said the fee is a constitutional delegation of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' power to impose taxes. The appeals court said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> may delegate `` the tax power where adequate standards are set for implementation of congressional intent.'' The fee bears a reasonable relationship to regulatory services performed by the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>, the appeals court added. The justices last week unanimously upheld federal `` safety user fees'' imposed on pipelines that transport natural gas and hazardous liquids. The case acted on today is <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Light vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 88-234.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Refuses To Hear Hawaiian Asbestos Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today refused to hear an appeal by <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> officials seeking to recover from asbestos manufacturers the cost of removing the product from public schools in the state. The court, without comment, let stand rulings from <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> that included <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> in a so-called class-action settlement of claims against the asbestos companies. <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> officials said they were not given a proper opportunity to remove themselves from the class-action court settlement in which thousands of school districts are eligible to receive money from an asbestos clean-up fund. <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> wants to be excused from the general lawsuit so that it can sue two manufacturers, <ORGANIZATION> Proko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Owens-Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, for millions of dollars in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> state courts. <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> officials said they first learned of the class-action settlement pending before a federal judge in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> in May 1987. At that time, they were told they had until Aug. 1, 1987, to notify the judge they did not wish to be a part of the settlement group, thereby preserving their right to sue separately. The officials said they were not alerted to a change in the deadline that moved it up to June 22, 1987, and later extended for a month. As a result, they said, they failed to notify the federal judge that they wished to opt out of the settlement. The officials also contended that the settlement violates the Constitution's 11th Amendment that limits federal court authority over states. The 3rd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> based in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> ruled against <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> last October. The case is <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Proko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, 88-1484.

There were no official estimates of the crowd, but <PERSON> Disney </PERSON> had anticipated that by the end of the day today, at least 15,000 people would visit the attraction blending movie and TV production with a backstage tour and other activities for the public. The theme of the park is the golden age of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> in the 1930s and 1940s. It is <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>'s third major attraction, after the original Magic Kingdom and Epcot Center nearby. Hope quipped that this was `` the largest theme park run by actors and cartoon characters _ unless you want to count <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>'' The <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON> family received lifetime passes to <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> attractions worldwide, silver-colored <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouse </PERSON> ears and a 9-inch statuette called Mouse-ker, patterned after <LOCATION> moviedom </LOCATION>'s Oscar award. `` We did n't known anything about a first family. We just wanted to be here early to be sure and see everything today before we go home,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON>. <PERSON> Eisner </PERSON> told the crowd that the park is `` dedicated to <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> ... a world that never was and always will be.''

 The judge at <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s trial said today the news media's attempt to force disclosure of a sealed document concerning a 1985 missile shipment may imperil the case against the former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> commented at a hearing shortly before the jury of nine women and three men began its ninth day of deliberations At a hearing, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said he thinks the issues raised by 10 news organizations seeking access to the document are `` very, very broad.'' `` If you prevail in this matter,'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> told a lawyer for the 10 news organizations, `` one possibility is I must discharge the jury.'' At issue is a stipulation summarizing highly secret intelligence intercepts that tracked a CIA-assisted November 1985 shipment of Hawk missiles to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The intercepts were gathered by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. North's lawyers used the document in his defense, referring to it in open court. In a highly unusual move, the document was given to the jury for its deliberations, but <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> has kept it under seal from the public. Ten news organizations, including The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, went to court April 21 in an attempt to force its release. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, acting on behalf of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence community, says release of the information would jeoparidize national security. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyk </PERSON>, representing the 10 news organizations, said the issues raised by the matter are narrow ones and pointed out that `` only one document'' is involved. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> replied that `` it's the only document I treated this way after 14 months of dealing with over a million documents.'' The document shows that top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials knew at the time of the November 1985 shipment that Hawk missiles were aboard the aircraft. On April 22, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> rejected the disclosure motion, saying the stipulation `` is a classified document.'' The news organizations appealed. An appeals court panel Friday sent the matter back to <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>, calling for a hearing on national security issues involved, saying it can not make a decision without having such a record. North is charged with creating a false chronology that says no one in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government knew until January 1986 that <ORGANIZATION> Hawks </ORGANIZATION> were aboard the November 1985 shipment. Part of <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s defense was to show that <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> and national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> were aware at the time from the intercepts what was aboard, yet arranged the false story that no one knew. North is accused of lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to cover up his role in secretly assisting the Nicaraguan Contra rebels, and lying to the attorney general about the diversion of funds to the Contras from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's secret arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. He also faces charges that he accepted a $ 13,800 home security system and converted $ 4,300 in traveler's checks from a Contra leader to his own use.

<TEXT>
 A federal judge today refused to stop the federal government from requiring <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> shrimpers to equip their nets with a device intended to preserve sea turtles in danger of extinction. <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Guste </PERSON> had filed suit on behalf of <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> shrimpers, who say the `` turtle excluder devices,'' commonly called TEDs, are dangerous to pull, unnecessary and reduce their catch. Environmentalists maintain the devices will help save the endangered <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s ridley sea turtle from extinction by reducing the number of turtles caught by the shrimpers. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> issued his ruling today after holding a rare telephone hearing Friday on <PERSON> Guste </PERSON>'s request for a temporary restraining order to block the requirement. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has the power and authority to suspend the enforcement of the use of TEDs until further studies are made, but chose not to do so,'' <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> wrote in his brief ruling. `` The courts have no such power or authority.'' `` If this law is n't changed, it will mean that the entire shrimping industry is out of business,'' Tee <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mialjevich </PERSON>, president of Concerned Shrimpers, said Saturday. `` It's not that we do n't want to save turtles, it's that we want to feed our families.'' <PERSON> Mialjevich </PERSON> said his group represents 2,000 shrimpers from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. TEDs fit into the mouth of trawls, a type of net, and have trap doors that let turtles escape. Shrimpers argue that they are too easily clogged with debris and that a significant portion of their catch escapes with the turtles. Shrimpers won a 60-day reprieve from hefty fines that were to have gone into effect today for boats not equipped with TEDs. <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> last week told the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> to issue only warnings through June 30 _ instead of fines of up to $ 10,000 _ to violators along the Gulf and <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> coasts. Shrimpers disclaim responsibility for most of the 11,000 turtle deaths estimated by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> each year. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON>, director of the 400-member <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shrimpers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which is also fighting the TEDs, said that <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s sea turtles are uncommon in the areas that his <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> members fish, adding, `` They're in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> and off the coast of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>.'' Shrimpers have proposed alternatives, <PERSON> Mialjevich </PERSON> said, including a $ 25 fee on shrimping licences each year dedicated to hatching and growing the turtles.

 A minister, his wife and two of their daughters were discovered shot to death in the church parsonage as the congregation sang hymns next door. `` The whole county's shook,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>, 27, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Olive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Branch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brethren </ORGANIZATION> in Christ, where <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelley </PERSON> was pastor. `` People do n't know whether to stay at home alone or in groups.'' Investigators believe the four were slain Saturday. The one-story frame house was locked and without signs of forced entry, said <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joesph </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's Cpl. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Feirrell </PERSON>. The body of <PERSON> Pelley </PERSON>, 38, was found in the hallway Sunday morning, and the bodies of <PERSON> Dawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelley </PERSON>, 32, and their daughters <PERSON> Janel </PERSON>, 8, and <PERSON> Jolene </PERSON>, 6, were discovered in a family room, <PERSON> Feirrell </PERSON> said. The Pelleys' three other children, ages 10, 14 and 17, were not home when the attack occurred, police said. Autopsies were being conducted, and all appeared to have been shot at close range by the same weapon, <PERSON> Feirrell </PERSON> said. He said today that it appeared that the attack was not a sex crime, but `` we're not discounting anything.'' There have been no arrests. The deaths were apparently not a murder-suicide; no weapon was found at the scene, he said. `` Indications are that robbery and burglary are not the motives of this homicide,'' <PERSON> Feirrell </PERSON> said. `` He have some ideas of a motive, but we're not going to discuss this yet.'' The bodies were discovered by church trustee <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hathaway </PERSON> on Sunday morning as the increasingly worried members of the church conducted services in his absence, said 48-year-old <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Schafer </PERSON>, one of the nearly 70 members of the church. Just as a group finished singing `` Jesus Brings Me A Song,'' <PERSON> Hathaway </PERSON> and two other parishioners who had entered the parsonage returned with the news, <PERSON> Schafer </PERSON> said. Many members remained at the church into the night, watching investigators remove the bodies and consoling each other. `` It's just a small country church and everyone's real close,'' said <PERSON> Schafer </PERSON>.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today revived an <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> prison inmate's lawsuit, ruling unanimously that the suit should not have been automatically ruled `` frivolous.'' The justices said a federal trial judge was wrong in finding <ORGANIZATION> Harry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sr. </ORGANIZATION>'s suit frivolous because it failed to state a claim on which a court could grant <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> some relief. Such a failure to comply with the federal rules of civil procedure does not automatically make a lawsuit frivolous, Justice <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> wrote for the court. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, an inmate at the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> State Reformatory, sued various prison officials in 1986. His complaint said he had been diagnosed by a doctor at the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prison </ORGANIZATION> as having a small brain tumor that affected his equilibrium and he should be excused from all work details. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' suit said that when he was transferred to the reformatory, doctors refused to treat the tumor and officials assigned him to do garment-manufacturing work. When he refused to continue working, the reformatory disciplinary board responded by transferring him to a less desirable cellhouse. The suit, however, did not allege `` deliberate indifference'' on the part of prison doctors or officials _ a necessary allegation in such cases when prison inmates allege cruel and unusual punishment. The case is <PERSON> Neitzke </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 87-1882.

<HEAD>Government Extends Cease-Fire With Rebel Forces</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Sandinista government has extended for the 11th time a month-long unilateral cease-fire on offensive operations. A statement from the president's press office Sunday said the government was extending the cease-fire to achieve `` firm and lasting peace in the region.'' The statement, broadcast over the government-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nicaragua </ORGANIZATION> radio, said the extension of the cease-fire was agreed to during meetings among the five Central American presidents in February. At the two-day meeting in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> agreed to push for democratic reforms in his country and moved up presidential elections by 10 months, to February 1990. The presidents also agreed to come up with a plan for dismantling the anti-Sandinista rebel forces, known as the Contras. Referring to the rebels, the government statement said extending the cease-fire would `` create conditions for the demobilization, relocation or repatriation of the Nicaraguans who have been involved directly or indirectly in armed activities.'' Some 11,000 Contra rebels, along with their families, live in Honduran camps near the Nicaraguan border. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> signed a temporary cease-fire with the Contras in March last year and the truce was to be the basis for a permanent peace accord but talks to extend it stalled. The <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have unilaterally extended the temporary cease-fire monthly since June, when the original one expired. The government statement said the cease-fire extension `` would not affect the general plans for defending the nation or repelling criminal attacks by the mercenary forces, which continue to bloody our country.'' Despite the cease-fire, Sandinista officials and the rebels continue to blame each other for offensive attacks. Meanwhile, the weekend edition of the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> party newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Barricada </ORGANIZATION> quoted Sandinista army Lt. Col. <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheelock </PERSON>, chief of intelligence, as saying fighting between government and guerrilla forces increased in recent months. <PERSON> Wheelock </PERSON> told the newspaper that during the first four months of this year, there were 403 rebel attacks, resulting in 43 Sandinista deaths and 75 injuries. Three Sandinistas were reported missing. <PERSON> Wheelock </PERSON> said the rebel forces, in `` attacks they have provoked'', have suffered 193 deaths. He said the Sandinista army captured another 89 rebels during the four-month period.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Lawyers may not be forced by federal law to represent poor people in non-criminal federal cases, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled today. By a 5-4 vote, the court ruled in favor of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallard </PERSON>, an attorney from rural <LOCATION> Fairfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, who specializes in business cases. He had refused a federal judge's order to represent prison inmates in a civil rights suit because he said he felt unqualified for the assignment. `` We do not mean to question, let alone denigrate, lawyers' ethical obligation to assist those who are too poor to afford counsel,'' said Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> for the court `` In a time when the need for legal services among the poor is growing and public funding for such services has not kept pace, lawyers' ethical obligation to volunteer their time and skills ... is manifest,'' he said. But <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said the federal law is clear: lawyers may be requested to help _ not forced to do so. The federal law authorizing legal help for poor people in civil cases specifically says a judge may `` request'' any attorney take the case, <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> noted. He was joined by Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> and Justice <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. In a dissenting opinion, Justice <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> may have used the word `` request'' but actually meant `` respectfully command.'' `` In my opinion, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> gave its endorsement to these judicial requests, assuming that it would be unthinkable for a lawyer to decline without an adequate reason,'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said. He was joined by Justices <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mallard </PERSON>, who argued his own case before the high court last February, had been ordered to represent two current inmates and a former inmate at the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> state prison in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>. The inmates said prison guards and officials filed false disciplinary reports against them, physically mistreated them and endangered their lives by revealing they were informants. A federal judge picked <PERSON> Mallard </PERSON> in 1987 to represent them from a list of more than 100 lawyers compiled by the <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and the state's bar association. In addition to saying he lacked experience in trial work, <PERSON> Mallard </PERSON> said the federal courts do not have power to require an unwilling attorney to represent someone in a civil case. The possible penalties <PERSON> Mallard </PERSON> faced for his refusal to take the prison cases were not discussed. But presumably he could have been held in contempt and fined or even jailed had the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rejected his appeal. Courts routinely assign lawyers to represent indigent defendants in criminal cases and the lawyers are paid, at taxpayer expense, generally a fraction of what they would receive normally. In civil rights cases, lawyers are paid expenses and may receive a share of any damages won by their clients. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vietor </PERSON> had denied <PERSON> Mallard </PERSON>'s motion to be excused from the inmates' suit. The judge said <PERSON> Mallard </PERSON> was competent and had trial experience. The case is <PERSON> Mallard </PERSON> vs. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, 87-1490.

 A funeral today for a brain-damaged baby who died after his father disconnected his respirator has stirred memories among parents who have faced the impending death of a youngster they know will never get well. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Linares </PERSON>, who had been severely brain-damaged and comatose since swallowing a balloon last August at a birthday party, was remembered at a private visitation Sunday and a funeral today attended by about 80 mourners. The 16-month-old's father, <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Linares </PERSON>, is charged with first-degree murder. Police say <PERSON> Linares </PERSON>, 23, held off hospital workers at gunpoint, unhooked his son's respirator and cradled the boy until he died. He said later that he did it `` because I loved my son ... I love my wife.'' Free on bond, <PERSON> Linares </PERSON> attended the boy's private funeral today at <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Queen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heaven </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <PERSON> Cicero </PERSON>. He and his wife, <PERSON> Tamara </PERSON>, sat in the front pew with their other two small children. `` Over and over again, we ask why, and there is no answer. Not all the priests, all the bishops, all the popes, all the moralists, can answer the question why,'' the Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON> said in his eulogy. The boy's death has prompted an outpouring of calls from parents whose children have died. Though some said they were disturbed by <PERSON> Linares </PERSON>' methods, many sympathized with the emotions that drove him. And the boy's physician, Dr. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, director of the pediatric intensive care unit at Rush-Presbyterian-St. <PERSON> Luke </PERSON>'s Medical Center, said mercy should be used in dealing with the `` I kept telling the dad -LRB- <PERSON> Linares </PERSON> -RRB-, ` I know it's terrible, but it wo n't last much longer'' <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> said of the boy's coma. He said <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> beat medical odds by staying alive so long. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Maher </PERSON>, a parent, said she understands what <PERSON> Linares </PERSON> went through during those months. Her daughter, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, spent the first two years of her life at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, the victim of cerebral palsy and chronic lung disease. Ms. <PERSON> Maher </PERSON> said there were times she considered unplugging <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>'s life-support equipment. `` A lot of times there is hardly anybody else in the hospital unit,'' she said. `` You could do it. It enters your mind when you feel you're being selfish by making a child suffer.'' Ms. <PERSON> Maher </PERSON> did n't do it and <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, now 7, lives at home with the aid of a ventilator. Ms. <PERSON> Maher </PERSON> said she hopes <PERSON> Linares </PERSON>' wife, <PERSON> Tamara </PERSON>, `` understands her husband. What they have now is each other. They will have to really love each other very much right now.''

 A couple's claim that a second infant daughter was kidnapped has led to intense new scrutiny of the unsolved 1986 abduction and death of their first daughter, authorities say. `` What are the chances of somebody breaking into your house and taking your small infant child once in your life? You figure out the odds and then figure out the odds that it could happen a second time in a completely different city,'' said Police Sgt. <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>. `` But I'm not trying to say anything.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> reported that their 6-week-old daughter, <PERSON> Heather </PERSON>, was missing after a masked gunman confronted Mrs. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> outside the family's home Saturday night, according to police. Mrs. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> said the man ordered her inside and struck her unconscious, according to a statement that police released Sunday. Authorities said <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> reported that he returned home from work and found his wife unconscious.

<TEXT>
 Police today charged a 22-year-old civil servant with murdering a man during a 15-minute shooting spree in an English coastal town. Fourteen other people were injured in the rampage. Police said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sartin </PERSON> was charged with killing 41-year-old <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Mackintosh </PERSON>. They said <PERSON> Sartin </PERSON> would appear in magistrates court later today. Witnesses said the gunman strolled through the streets of <LOCATION> Monkseaton </LOCATION>, a fashionable suburb of the <LOCATION> Whitley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> seaside resort in northeast <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, firing a double-barreled shotgun at anyone within range. The victims Sunday included several churchgoers returning home, a cyclist, a couple driving by in a car, a man mowing his lawn, a woman who opened her front door and others who peered out their windows, officials said. <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tyneside </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Scargill </PERSON> said six of those wounded were hospitalized, three in serious condition. The first ambulance officers on the scene came under fire. `` He was having a go at any person he met,'' said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Heads </PERSON>, superintendent of the <LOCATION> Northumbria </LOCATION> ambulance service. `` I have never seen anyone so calm and totally in control _ he was like a robot,'' said a resident, 40-year-old <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON>. Witnesses said the gunman was dressed all in black, with dark sunglasses and his hair in a pony tail. They said he wore an ammunition belt around his waist, had a hunting knife strapped to one leg, and stalked the streets, pausing only to shoot and reload. The gunman, who had driven to the suburb just before midday, drove away after the rampage. An unarmed policeman chased him in an unmarked car and arrested him without incident outside a pub. News reports said the suspect lived with his parents a mile from the shooting scene. A policeman stood guard outside their home today. Press Association, the British news agency, quoted the gunman's brother as saying `` All I can say is that he is such a loving and caring lad. The agency did not identify the brother. The tabloid <PERSON> Sun </PERSON> said the gunman regularly went clay-pigeon shooting with his father and quoted a neighbor identified as <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephenson </PERSON> as saying, `` You could n't hope to meet a more pleasant young man.'' Police said <PERSON> Mackintosh </PERSON> was a telephone company employee who was married and had two children. He was returning from church when he was gunned down. `` He just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time,'' Detective Superintendent <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Bention </PERSON> told a news conference today. `` The man who was killed was not known to the gunman and we believe the same applies to the people who have been injured.'' <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Holloway </PERSON>, a 47-year-old engineer, said he and his wife, <PERSON> Heather </PERSON>, and son, <PERSON> Adam </PERSON>, 6, were driving in their car when the gunman took aim at them. They escaped injury. `` He was as cool as a cucumber, sauntering along as though he was out for a stroll,'' <PERSON> Holloway </PERSON> said. The Rev. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> said parishioners leaving his morning service at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Andrew </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reformed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> heard a shot and saw a woman fall to the ground opposite the church. One parishioner tried to help the woman but was forced to run for cover when more shots were heard, <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> said. Home Secretary <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON>, the Cabinet minister responsible for law and order, ordered a full report on the incident from police, and the Police Federation called for even tighter gun control laws. The rampage was similar to the massacre of 16 people in the southern town of <LOCATION> Hungerford </LOCATION> on Aug. 19, 1987, by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, who killed himself after being trapped by police. The bloodbath shocked <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, where most police are not armed. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s already strict gun control laws later were tightened to outlaw sawed-off shotguns, mortars and semiautomatic rifles like the one <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> used. Police said the gun used in Sunday's shooting was licensed, but not to the gunman.

<DATELINE>YOGYAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> used a visit to this region in central Java Monday to underscore her new efforts to stress disaster relief and disaster preparedness. Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who is traveling with her husband, Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, spent the day on her own, visiting a 9th century <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> temple, a sultan's palace and two projects that deal with preventing natural and ecological disasters. On her first trip overseas with her husband, Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has highlighted the issue she hopes to spotlight _ disasters. `` It is something that strikes a chord,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, explaining that Americans have often reached out to people suffering from natural disasters. The 39-year-old Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is trained as a lawyer, a profession she says she thinks of going back to but that might be doubtful while her husband holds the vice presidency, she said. But Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said she intends in her new role to `` dispel the myth that went on for so long that when you put a wedding ring on ... the brain stops,'' she said. Before she decided to adopt disasters as her focus of interest, Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said she talked with first lady <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` The only person I talked to was the most important person, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. She added that Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was encouraging about her interest and, `` Basically, she said, go for it.'' Asked if she feared upstaging Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, `` How can you overshadow her, really.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told reporters traveling with her to this city in the middle of <LOCATION> Java </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> that she hopes to educate Americans around the country about disaster relief, but she has to watch her dollars and cents. `` I have no official capacity, nobody pays for me. ... I do n't have a plane, I do n't have anything,'' she said So, Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, she would try to make speeches in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> when invited by various groups. In this bustling city, Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> visited a center where people are trained to cope with volcanic eruptions. <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, a densely populated nation of islands, has about 130 active volcanoes, 18 percent of the world's. Then she stopped by a village where the local people, many of them young children, cheered and clapped. The village, <LOCATION> Keji </LOCATION>, is the site of a project funded by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> where villagers are taught to recognize insects that naturally destroy those bugs that damage crops. Officials explained to Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> how the ladybug, for instance, is the farmer's friend. <PERSON> Clare </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfowitz </PERSON>, wife of <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfowitz </PERSON>, called Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s visit `` a tremendous shot in the arm for officials promoting economic development in <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>.'' `` Our AID people were excited to have her see this at the top of the list,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Wolfowitz </PERSON> said. Then Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> toured the 9th century <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> temple at <LOCATION> Bobobudur </LOCATION>, which has 10 terraces and is considered one of the greatest <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> temples in the world. Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> also toured the palace of a sultan here, viewing his daggers, hand-carved puppets and elaborate belts, among other things. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who remained in <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION> for high-level meetings with government officials, was jealous of her schedule, Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. When <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> saw her itinerary, she said he said, `` Ca n't I come?''

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> today cited two contractors for safety and health violations and proposed $ 1.15 million in fines for a methane gas explosion that killed three workers in a sewer tunnel project. <PERSON> S.A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Healy </PERSON> of <PERSON> McCook </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, the main contractor for the project, was cited for 68 willful violations carrying fines of $ 680,000 in connection with last November's fatal blast. CH2M <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Corvallis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, hired to supervise the project, was cited for 47 willful violations carrying penalties of $ 470,000. Both companies have 15 days to appeal the citations and penalties to the <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Connors </PERSON>, regional administrator of <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> office. The proposed fine of $ 10,000 per willful violation was the maximum allowed, <PERSON> Connors </PERSON> said. Willful violations are the most serious issued by <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> and are based on a finding that the contractors knew that a dangerous condition violated safety standards and made no effort to correct it, <PERSON> Connors </PERSON> said. `` These penalties are one of the largest I am aware of for the region and certainly the largest that I am aware of for a tunnel project,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> investigators believe they have located the exact cause of the Nov. 10 explosion but <PERSON> Connors </PERSON> declined to release that information, citing concerns about future litigation. Criminal negligence charges could also be filed against the contractors, he said. The citations accused the two contractors of failing to train workers about the proper response when methane is detected in a tunnel, using inappropriate electrical equipment and wiring methods for a `` gassy'' tunnel, failing to have adequate ventilation for the tunnel, and keeping inadeqauate records of air monitoring in the tunnel. <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>'s investigation concluded that the two contractors were directly responsible for the deaths of the three workers, he said.

 An Israeli human rights group said today that April was the second-bloodiest month of the Palestinian revolt, with at least 34 Palestinians killed in clashes with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops in the occupied lands. A 30-year-old man was stabbed to death today in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> by fellow Palestinians after being accused of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Shin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bet </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> service </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. Palestinians throughout the territories held May Day demonstrations in celebration of the international labor holiday, and shouted pro-PLO and pro-communist slogans. <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said four Palestinians were shot and wounded in clashes with soldiers in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The victims included a 10-year-old boy who was shot in the head, the reports said. The Jerusalem-based <ORGANIZATION> Israeli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> in the Territories said 33 of the Palestinians killed in April died of gunshot wounds suffered in clashes with troops or paramilitary police. The other person died of beating injuries inflicted by soldiers, it said. The center, founded by a number of left-wing parties and peace movements, said the worst month of the uprising was April 1988, when 44 Palestinians were killed. The center said a total of 423 Palestinians have died since the uprising began 16 months ago to protest <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> rule of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> death count, based on <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> hospital reports, also listed 34 Palestinians killed by army gunfire last month, plus seven more killed as suspected collaborators. The AP count shows a total of 457 Palestinians killed in the revolt; the figure includes Arabs killed by Palestinians as suspected collaborators. Eighteen Israelis also have died in the uprising. An army spokesman disputed the figures, saying 28 Palestinians were killed during April and that the figure was higher in several previous months. According to army figures, a total of 351 Palestinians have died in clashes with soldiers. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION> today, masked youths entered a photo studio owned by <PERSON> Ahed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramini </PERSON> and stabbed him several times, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said. The army said it was checking <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports that he died on the way to the hospital. <PERSON> Ramini </PERSON>'s death would bring to more than 40 the number of Arabs killed as suspected collaborators during the uprising. <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, a right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister, criticized the army for arresting a Jewish settler in the death of a 14-year-old Palestinian during a stone-throwing clash in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>. During a Cabinet debate Sunday, Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> rejected right-wing demands that settlers be allowed to fire more liberally when their cars are stoned. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> today: `` The detention of a Jew who was defending his life while being attacked, under these present cirumstances when attacks on Jews are everyday events, is something that is grave and unnecessary.'' `` To investigate if need be, yes. To detain, no,'' he said. The settler, <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Lulu </PERSON>, was released on $ 3,880 bail today after fellow settlers maintained a two-day vigil outside military government headquarters in <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio reported <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Lulu </PERSON> was freed after a hearing before <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Dalia </PERSON> <PERSON> Koval </PERSON> and quoted her as saying the settler apparently acted in self-defense when he fired his pistol Saturday. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> media reports said he fired after Palestinian youths stoned his car. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Lulu </PERSON> has not been charged, but remains under investigation, police said. <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, a city of 79,000 Palestinians where settlers live in two tiny enclaves, is a frequent site of friction between Jews and Arabs. Most Jewish settlements in the occupied lands are located away from Arab population centers. More than 70,000 settlers live in the occupied lands amid 1.7 million Palestinians.

 An activist veterans group, contending there still are <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> war prisoners in <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION>, is seeking a country that will offer asylum to anyone who brings out a living POW, a spokesman for the group said Monday. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Sampley </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> War </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION>, said the organization believes it can get an American out within six months after asylum is guaranteed. The group has written officials of the Australian, British, Canadian, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, French and Swedish embassies asking that they offer a guarantee since the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has not. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have criticized independent efforts to find POWs in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, saying they jeopardize official efforts to resolve the POW-MIA issue. Two members of <PERSON> Sampley </PERSON>'s organization were held prisoner for 41 days in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> last year after they entered the country to publicize a reward of more than $ 2 million offered by several members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for the safe return of a prisoner of war. Earlier, the veterans group put $ 2,000 worth of Vietnamese, Laotian and other currency in plastic bags and floated the bags down the <LOCATION> Mekong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> with notices of the reward. While <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say they have seen no proof that missing soldiers remain alive in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, they do not rule out the possibility. About 2,400 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen are listed as missing in action in <LOCATION> Southheast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sampley </PERSON> said as many as 100 still could be alive in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and scores more in other communist-controlled countries in the region. He said an affiliate organization, Homecoming II, has had contact with an officer of an Indochinese country who is willing to bring out an American POW if he and others who would come with him can be assured of political asylum as well as the reward. <PERSON> Sampley </PERSON> said he could not give the name of the officer, his country or any other details about him for fear he might be arrested. The American would be brought out within 180 days after asylum is guaranteed, said <PERSON> Sampley </PERSON>, who has a construction business in <LOCATION> Kinston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, brought down by a scandal that reached the top of business and politics, is expected to ask former Foreign Minister <PERSON> Masayoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ito </PERSON> to replace him, government sources said Monday. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said a week ago he would resign, but the choice of a successor as leader of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and thus as prime minister, has been put off until he returns Sunday from a nine-day trip to <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. After <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s announcement, party secretary-general <PERSON> Shintaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Abe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Keizo </PERSON> <PERSON> Obuchi </PERSON>, the chief <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> secretary, informally asked <PERSON> Ito </PERSON> to take the job. <PERSON> Ito </PERSON>, who is 75 and diabetic, said he would not take the job because of his age and health. The government sources said privately Monday, however, that the party would have `` no other choice ... but to persuade'' <PERSON> Ito </PERSON>, who they described as the only candidate on whom all party factions could agree. <PERSON> Ito </PERSON> has a clean reputation and most other party leaders have been linked to the scandal centered on <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an information and publishing conglomerate. He now is chairman of the Executive Council, the party's policy-making body. <PERSON> Masaya </PERSON> <PERSON> Ito </PERSON>, a critic of the political scene who is not related to the former foreign minister, said the offer of succession `` is no more than asking him to lend his clean image without actual political power.'' `` It sounds to me no more than an insult for a senior politician like <PERSON> Ito </PERSON>,'' said the critic, who was an aide to the late Prime Minister <PERSON> Hayato </PERSON> <PERSON> Ikeda </PERSON>. `` It is apparent that the current party leadership is trying to remain in control by appointing <PERSON> Ito </PERSON> and other senior officials. No dignified politician would take such an offer.'' Whoever the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> choose will become prime minister because of their large majority in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. The party has rejected opposition demands to call elections so voters can pass judgment on the scandal and an unpopular 3 percent sales tax that took effect April 1. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said he was resigning to take responsibility for the scandal. He is to step down after <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> passes the 1989 budget, which has been approved by the lower house. Fourteen people have been arrested on bribery and other charges so far in the Recruit case, and three Cabinet members were forced to step down before <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s announcement. Recruit sold stocks in a subsidiary to about 160 influential politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen at bargain prices before the shares were offered for public sale. The price soared when the stock went on the market and the buyers made huge profits. Prosecutors contend that, in some cases, the deals amounted to bribes in exchange for favors to the company. The prime minister has acknowledged getting more than $ 1 million in political donations from Recruit and that an aide, who committed suicide the day after <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> announced his resignation, received a loan of about $ 376,000 from the company.

 Thousands of prehistoric Indian petroglyphs etched into dark, basalt rock have survived for hundreds and hundreds of years, but time no longer is on their side. The once-remote volcanic ridge they adorn on <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>'s west side is in danger of being swallowed by civilization. `` If we do n't get the federal authorization from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> this year the pressures of development and vandalism are so intense out there we may be losing the opportunity,'' said <PERSON> Ike </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastvold </PERSON>, a leader in a move to have <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> create a national monument to preserve the carvings of humans and animals. `` It really is the 11th hour.'' Evidence of the threat to the petroglphs is all around the 17-mile escarpment, created by lava flows that began 190,000 years ago. Houses and roads creep closer. One path to the area passes mounds of rubbish. Some drawings have been marred by spray paint or damaged by gunshots. The drawings are the work of early Pueblo Indians who lived in the area between 1300 and 1650 A.D. Spanish settlers arriving the area in the 1500s added their own petroglyphs. `` This is the largest concentration of rock art in the world in a major city,'' said Eastvold. He said preserving the more material elements of a culture such as architecture is not enough. `` The art and religion are what made them live,'' Eastvold said. He said the petroglyphs are even more exciting because they were done by the ancestors of the present Pueblo Indians of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and eastern <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, meaning they still are part of a living culture. Eastvold said the petroglyphs also are artistically appealing. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senators, Republican <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> and Democrat <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Bingaman </PERSON>, have introduced legislation to establish the monument. They conducted an <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> public lands subcommittee hearing Friday in <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION> to hear from federal, state and local officials, developers, conservationists and Indian leaders. Those who spoke at the hearing indicated support for the monument. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, regional director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said at the hearing that if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> fails to take action within two years the land will become degraded to the point it could no longer be considered for monument status. Eastvold, head of the group <ORGANIZATION> Friends </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Albuquerque </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroglyphs </ORGANIZATION>, said he believes that if the national monument is not created most of the land will be lost to development. `` You would probably end up with little bits and pieces preserved in an inadequate manner,'' he said. The bill introduced by <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bingaman </PERSON>, and an identical measure introduced in the House by Rep. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.M. </LOCATION>, calls for the national monument to include 7,100 acres. About 4,300 acres of land already is publicly owned. The total value of the land that would have to be acquired is estimated at $ 90 million, with $ 50 million coming from the federal government and the remaining $ 40 million from the city and state. The state and city already have made provisions for a portion of their commitments. In addition to preserving the estimated 15,000 carvings, proponents say the monument would draw 400,000 visitors and generate $ 5 million in revenue for the city and its businesses in the first year alone. <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> believes that what should be stressed is not so much the cost of doing the project but the cost of not doing it because the drawings would continue to be degraded until they are lost forever. <PERSON> Bingaman </PERSON> agreed. `` I think the longer you go into the future the more important it's going to have been that people at this time took the opportunity to set some land aside and preserve some of these petroglyphs,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 The legendary French wine house Chateau Lafite-Rothschild is sending a task force to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to recork _ at no charge _ older bottles of the fabulously expensive <LOCATION> Bordeaux </LOCATION>. Starting Tuesday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the experts will recork some 2,000 bottles of 1962, or older, vintages. The group also will visit <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. The Lafite team, which was in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> last year, took reservations for the recorking service through next January. The demand, said the company, was `` tremendous.'' An 1806 vintage _ the same year <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> ordered the blockade of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and construction of the <ORGANIZATION> Arc </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Triomphe </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> _ will be among the wines to be recorked. A bottle from that year once sold for $ 31,000. `` There is no charge for this service,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Milligan </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Seagram </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chateau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Estate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the major Lafite importer in this country. `` The chateau does it as the most remarkable after-sale service in the industry.'' <PERSON> Milligan </PERSON> would say only that the 1806 is owned by a collector in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> whose identity he could n't disclose. The recorking is carried out by Lafite because, as the wine experts say, `` wine is only as good as its cork.'' Old corks can become dry, which allows air to seep into the bottle and can cause wine to spoil. Recorking is especially needed for the nobler wines of the world, made with the view that a very good bottle may not reach the most drinkable period for years, even decades and generations. A minimum of 15 years is often recommended before a given vintage of Lafite should be consumed. The 1961 vintage, for instance, was n't ready for drinking until last year _ 27 years. `` As the <ORGANIZATION> Rothschilds </ORGANIZATION> have tended over a century of vintages at Lafite, they have determined that their bottles should be recorked about every 25 years or so,'' said <PERSON> Milligan </PERSON>. `` Even the finest cork has limited lifespan, and keeping the cork in good condition is essential to protect the wine.''

 Student protest leaders Monday blasted government meetings with selected students as a sham, accusing officials of trying to co-opt students without agreeing to democratic reforms. Student activists also said they had been warned to stop planning a protest for May 4, the 70th anniversary of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s first democratic movement. They called for the establishment of a nationwide independent student union and indefinite continuation of the class boycott begun last week by about 75,000 students in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and nearby <LOCATION> Tianjin </LOCATION>. Classes were out Monday to celebrate the May Day holiday. High-ranking government officials from two ministries met with students for a third day to discuss student calls for more democracy, the state-run radio said. On the steps of <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s library, a spokesman for the indepedent student association said the group had rejected the talks. Meetings between the government and students began over the weekend in a government effort to quell two weeks of student demonstrations. The protests culminated Thursday when 150,000 students and their supporters participated in the biggest march in 40 years of communist rule. The students want a fundamental reform of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s tightly controlled political system, including a free press and an end to widespread corruption and nepotism. `` We demand a dialogue based on the principles of equality and openness, conducted directly between democratically chosen student representatives and government decision-makers,'' said the spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Universities </ORGANIZATION>. He said the association wants the government to recognize it as a legal entity and conduct its talks with association representatives. On Saturday, two student leaders from the association were invited to the first meeting. After that, all representatives appear to have been from officially appointed student unions. On Monday, the Guangming Daily, a national newspaper for intellectuals, praised the meetings. It called them an example of `` socialist democracy'' and said they were a way of `` clearing up misunderstandings and suspicion.'' Many students disagreed. Students particularly were upset when <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Xitong </PERSON> and city's <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Ximing </PERSON> said they made $ 81 a month, about three times the average monthly salary. `` They forgot to add their free cars and all their free meals,'' said one student. `` They also forgot their free apartments, fancy trips and bottles of <LOCATION> Maotai </LOCATION>,'' said another. `` The government answers to student questions illustrated their lack of sincerity,'' the association spokesman said. He accused the government of trying to `` deceive public opinion'' by appearing to concede to student demands. Student leaders at the <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Normal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> declared on their campus loudspeaker: `` Until we have a dialogue with the government that meets our demands, we wo n't return to class.'' `` Students, we risked bloodshed and danger to get as far as we have,'' said a poster at the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` Please continue your efforts.'' On Monday, four of the seven leaders of the association, said they were under pressure to stop organizing a protest for May 4. <PERSON> Ou </PERSON> <PERSON> Yang </PERSON>, a student leader from <ORGANIZATION> Qinghua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said teachers from his college on Sunday night warned him to confine his activities to inside the <ORGANIZATION> Qinghua </ORGANIZATION> gates. <PERSON> Wu'er </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaixi </PERSON>, president of the association, said officials at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Normal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> had informed him through friends that he should stop his activities. He said he was afraid of arrest. Another two leaders said they planned to stay close to their dormitories and restrict their organizing activities. A student-run loudspeaker at Wu'er's school broadcast an open letter to his mother Monday. `` Mother,'' the letter went, `` I am not wrong. But perhaps for the sake of many more mothers and fathers in the future, you might have to lose your son. `` You always taught me to be courageous and speak out for my beliefs. That is what I am doing.'' The government harshly criticized the student movement last week, calling it a plot to overthrow the government. It toned down its criticism after tens of thousands of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> citizens applauded the student march Thursday, but it continues to claim that an unspecified `` handful of people'' illegally are plotting revolution. On Monday, two groups of students met with <PERSON> Qi </PERSON> <PERSON> Yuanjing </PERSON>, minister of the <ORGANIZATION> Metallurgical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Lin </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhongtang </PERSON>, minister of the <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Astronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION>, the radio said. Selected students also met with State Education Minister He Dongchang and high-ranking officials from the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> city goverment. The meetings with government ministers were an indication of how seriously the government regards the recent student unrest. The government apparently hopes it can split most of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s students from the leaders of the independent student association and their calls for fundamental change Indeed, throughout the meetings, officials have made no promises to change state policy. They have acknowledged some student complaints but mostly have urged students to `` calm down.''

 <PERSON> Rosie </PERSON> the Duck can have her ducklings anywhere she chooses, officials say, and the mallard has decided to set up her nest alongside a downtown high-rise. Because the duck enjoys the protection of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, she and her 12 eggs can not be moved from a planter near the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> to a safer location. It's against the law, at least until hunting season opens in the fall. `` You ca n't touch her, harm her, or take her,'' declared a government agent who viewed her Friday. Indeed, the duck is protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Anyone who touches the bird could be fined $ 2,000 or be sentenced to up to one year in jail, said the agent.

<HEAD>Governor: Budget Cuts Will `Go Beyond Common Sense'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY COATES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Budget cuts forced by voter rejection of a tax package will `` go beyond common sense,'' Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> said Monday as the administration studied closing some universities and hospitals. Rejection in Saturday's referendum means the state will have a projected $ 720 million deficit when the new fiscal year begins July 1, <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> said. Even with passage of the package, the administration would have been forced to cut spending by $ 200 million, including reducing a charity hospital to an outpatient clinic and laying off 4,100 state employees, <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> said. `` Now we must go beyond that. The cuts will be deeper than I wanted, deeper than common sense, but we will not do business as usual,'' <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> said wearily at an impromptu news conference. The governor referred to projecting oil prices high enough to balance the budget on paper, a routine practice until <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> took office in March 1988. With high oil price projections, the state ended each year with massive deficits which had accumulated to $ 900 million by the time he took over. Each increase of $ 1 a barrel in the price of oil, sustained for a year, means around $ 28 million in extra state tax revenue. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> said the state realistically could increase the projection from $ 15 to $ 17 a barrel since the price of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> oil at this time is about $ 18, `` but you're only talking about $ 60 million if we do that.'' The tradition of having oil companies and other big businesses pay a big share of state revenues in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> dates back to the days of populist Gov. <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON> in the 1920s and 1930s. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>'s plan would have shifted the tax burden away from big business, putting more of a load on individuals through the income tax. It would have reduced sales taxes and given businesses incentives to move to <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and expand. The plan also included a $ 1.4 billion program to improve highways, airports and shipping ports, funded by a gasoline tax increase of 4 cents a gallon. <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> touted his plan as a way to bring jobs to <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, which has the highest unemployment rate in the nation at 9.6 percent, and to end the state's dependence on the oil industry. `` We had a number of -LRB- industrial -RRB- prospects that had anticipated fiscal reform to open new plants,'' <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> said. `` I had to call them this morning and talk it through. It's not all good news. We'll hang on to what we can.'' The Legislature could extend for another year a temporary suspension of sales tax exemptions on food, drugs and utilities that was put into effect last summer to stave off bankruptcy, <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> said. Allowing that suspension to expire on June 30 would leave a $ 500 million hole in the budget, he said. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> said he did n't want to talk about specifics of what universities or hospitals might have to be closed. `` You'll know as soon as we know,'' he said. Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Adley </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and a close adviser to the governor, had said earlier in the day that his phone `` was ringing off the hook this morning. They're -LRB- lawmakers -RRB- scared. Reality is setting in and they do n't want to lose institutions in their districts. Meanwhile, state Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, perhaps the most vocal legislative opponent of the tax package, said lawmakers might want to extend sales tax increases to avoid closure of charity hospitals and universities. Throughout the tax referendum campaign, <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> said the people `` do n't want any more taxes. None.'' `` I'll hold an olive branch out to him -LRB- the governor -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, a former <PERSON> Ku </PERSON> <PERSON> Klux </PERSON> Klan leader. `` We've got to solve the financial problems. The Legislature might be willing to restore some of the temporary taxes if it comes to that. We still have some time to play with this thing.''

 Ads for `` Mississippi Burning'' adorn the lobby of the town's only theater, but the manager says there's been little interest in the film based loosely on the 1964 slayings of three civil rights workers nearby `` I've had the advertisement up for a couple of weeks _ that it's coming May 24 _ and I can only recall a couple of people who had comments,'' said <PERSON> Shelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON>, whose family has owned and operated the <LOCATION> Ellis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Theater </LOCATION> in the town of 7,000 for 35 years. Mayor <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> McClain </PERSON> said most of the talk in town now involved plans for a special memorial program June 21 to honor the three civil rights workers. `` Mississippi Burning,'' starring <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Hackman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Willem </PERSON> <PERSON> Dafoe </PERSON>, is a fictionalized account of federal investigation of the murders of <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaney </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwerner </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Neshoba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Their bodies were found in an earthen dam near <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> six weeks after their deaths on June 21, 1964. The <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> release has received praise from movie critics, but harsh criticism from people who were involved in the civil rights movement, particularly blacks who see the movie giving too much credit to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. `` I'm sure if there were people here who were real interested in the movie, they have already gone to a town where it has been shown,'' said <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON>. The film was shown earlier this year in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, about 80 miles southwest, and in <LOCATION> Meridian </LOCATION>, about 40 miles east. <PERSON> Steigher </PERSON> said his theater seats about 500 people, which means 2,500 people could see the movie during its five-day run. `` Of course, that would mean a sellout every night and it's been a long time since that has happened,'' he said. <PERSON> McClain </PERSON> said he also had not heard too many comments about the movie. The mayor said he had seen the film and thought it `` just piled everything on one locality when at the time it was spread out across the state and the South.'' He said <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> had good race relations and `` I thought they really did n't give our city a very fair presentation, even for 1964.''

 After complaining to police for nearly four months to shut down a crack house on her block, <PERSON> Terri </PERSON> <PERSON> Tillman-Brown </PERSON> said officers raided the wrong house _ hers. Police with a search warrant on Friday broke through the front door of <PERSON> Tillman-Brown </PERSON>'s home while she was away, according to neighbors. The undercover officers ransacked her home, left her front door broken and open, and her dog running free outside, <PERSON> Tillman-Brown </PERSON> said. They also opened a sealed bag of cremated ashes she said she had been keeping for a friend's burial. Some of the ashes spilled onto her bed, she said. The police apparently found none of the cocaine and drug paraphernalia the search warrant said they were seeking. Police declined immediate comment. `` I called the police today and they told me they ca n't help me till Monday,'' <PERSON> Tillman-Brown </PERSON> said over the weekend. Tillman-Brown, a 38-year-old accountant for the state, said the raid occurred four days after the drug dealers were evicted from a house next door. She said she had complained to police about the nearby drug activity almost weekly since they moved in in January.

 Attackers ambushed a second <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> food convoy in southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, spraying the lead vehicle with small arms fire, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials said Monday. No one was hit in Friday's attack near <LOCATION> Kapoeta </LOCATION> and the convoy arrived Sunday at its destination in <LOCATION> Torit </LOCATION> with 300 tons of food, said World Food Program spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>. It is the second ambush of a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> convoy in less than two weeks near <LOCATION> Kapoeta </LOCATION>, a garrison town held by the rebel <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> Eight armed rebel escorts were killed April 18 when the first Operation Lifeline <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> convoy to <LOCATION> Torit </LOCATION> was hit by a rocket and automatic weapons fire. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> temporarily suspended operations on the overland route between <LOCATION> Kapoeta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Torit </LOCATION>, and last week's convoy was the first to make a new attempt. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said they will stop using the route again and any further supplies will be sent to <LOCATION> Torit </LOCATION> through <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION>. The $ 132 million operation hopes to save 100,000 lives in <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, where officials estimate as many as 500,000 people died from drought, flood and war-induced famine last year. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials concede that political, logistical and other problems will prevent them delivering more than than half their 115,500-ton goal of supplies before seasonal rains cut off outlying villages. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said 27 trucks set out in Friday's convoy from <LOCATION> Lokichoggio </LOCATION>, in northern Kenyan, and were 12 miles outside <LOCATION> Kapoeta </LOCATION> when attacked. `` It was small arms fire from the <PERSON> bush </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. `` They did n't see anybody and it's hard to say who they -LRB- the attackers -RRB- were or how many there were.'' Government troops for years have battled rebels demanding more autonomy in southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, but both sides agreed in March to allow safe passage for relief food. Other gunmen in the south include nomadic tribal warriors and government-sponsored militiamen. <PERSON> Nils </PERSON> <PERSON> Enquist </PERSON>, Operation Lifeline's logistics coordinator, said between six and 10 bullets struck the vehicle. `` It was carrying a driver and the convoy leader and it is only by the grace of God they were n't hurt,'' <PERSON> Enquist </PERSON> said. `` The trucks following the lead vehicle were n't shot at.'' He identified the convoy leader as <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Vigay </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> employee from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, and the driver as an unnamed Kenyan. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said the convoy halted briefly as armed rebel guards unsuccesfully sought the attackers.

 Many Americans see Latin American communism as a rising danger to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, while the threat from communism in other nations is viewed with less alarm, a <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General-Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> poll has found. Forty-four percent in the survey saw communism in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> as more of a threat to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> security than it has been in the past. Only about 15 percent said the same for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The poll's respondents said overwhelmingly that capitalism holds greater influence than communism in the world today, 62 percent to 23 percent, with the rest undecided. But only one in five said communism is on the decline. Instead, among those with an opinion, 27 percent said communism was on the rise in the world and 46 percent said it was holding steady. The poll of 1,108 adults March 6-15 had a 3-point margin of error. With a Sino-Soviet summit planned this month, respondents said by a narrow margin that closer relations between the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> posed a threat to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, 49 percent to 41 percent, with the rest unsure. About half favored closer <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to encourage democratic reforms there. A third were opposed on grounds that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade would only support the current system; the rest were undecided. Greater trade with the Soviets was supported equally by Republicans and Democrats. But there was a political split on <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>: Conservatives and Republicans were considerably more likely than liberals and Democrats to see communism there as an increasing threat. Liberals also were more confident in another measure: 71 percent said capitalism has more influence than communism in the world, while just 57 percent of conservatives agreed. Better-educated Americans and men were more likely to perceive changes in communism and to view communist nations as a decreasing threat to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Thirty-six percent of those with postgraduate work said communism is on the decline, for example, while just 13 percent of high school graduates held that view. The greatest agreement was on changes in communism. Seventy percent said most communist countries are less likely now to follow Soviet policies, and 67 percent said most communist nations are giving their people more freedom. A 58 percent majority saw the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as moving away from its centralized communist economic system; 47 percent said the same of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and 45 percent saw such movement in some Eastern European nations. Just 7 percent said communism was less of a threat in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> than it has been in the past; 30 percent rated it about the same, 9 percent said it never has been a threat and the rest had no answer. Marxists rule in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>; communists rule in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and are waging insurgencies in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and other Latin American nations. Communism elsewhere was viewed with less suspicion. Just 14 percent saw communism in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as more of a threat to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> than it has been in the past, while 38 percent saw it as less of a threat. Similarly, Chinese communism was seen as more of a threat by 15 percent and less of a threat by 34 percent. Communism in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> also was seen as more of a danger by 15 percent, and as less of one by 28 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a communications company based in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, publishes the Richmond Times-Dispatch, the Richmond News Leader, the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> -RRB- Journal, and operates TV stations <ORGANIZATION> WXFL </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, WCBD in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> WJKS </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s deputy foreign minister says <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> soon will buy weapons from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and is negotiating with other unidentified countries for advanced fighter bombers, the government press reported Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, quoted <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Besharati </PERSON> as saying <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> must diversify its arms-purchasing sources. `` If we depend on one particular country or bloc, then they take advantage of the situation ... They want to impose their own ideology on us,'' he said. His comments were published in an interview with the English-language daily <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, the agency said. <PERSON> Besharati </PERSON> said in `` extensive talks'' with Soviet officials `` all related issues have been finalized.'' He did not disclose what kind of Soviet weapons <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> will acquire or the cost. But the Iranians are known to be seeking to upgrade and rebuild their air force and armored divisions following the Aug. 20 cease-fire in the eight-year war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Recently, the Iranians have turned increasingly to the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc for much of their military hardware as relations between <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> warmed. Speculation the Soviets would start supplying the Iranians with sophisticated weapons systems, possibly including aircraft and tanks, was heightened when Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> in February. The Soviets were <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s main weapons supplier during the war and are participating in a major defense exhibition in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> that ends Tuesday. But <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> purchased large amounts of Soviet-designed weapons systems, mainly through <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` The Soviets are not prepared to go too far as far as the Iranians are concerned,'' said <PERSON> Hans-Heino </PERSON> <PERSON> Kopietz </PERSON>, a military specialist with the London-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>. `` They want to play footsy with both sides. Just how much hardware they will provide the Iranians themselves is questionable. They do n't want to be seen to be tipping the balance, but it makes sense that they should do something in this regard,'' he said in a telephone interview. The Moscow-Tehran rapprochement was accelerated by the halt in the gulf war and the Soviet withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> supports Moslem guerrillass fighting <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s communist government. Before the 1979 reolution, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s military was armed almost exclusively with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> weaponry bought by <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON> before he was toppled. A U.S.-led embargo did much to prevent the Iranians acquiring spare parts and replacements for that equipment. By the end of the war, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s once-powerful air power was reduced to an estimated 60 operational combat jets. Before the war, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had 447 combat aircraft, all of them U.S.-supplied. They included 199 F-4 Phantoms, 166 F-5 Eagles and 77 F-14 advanced interceptors. The Iranian agency quoted <PERSON> Besharati </PERSON> as saying: `` We have gone into negotiations with various countries, outside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, for the purchase of fighter bombers. `` Very soon, you will see fighter bombers flying ... which are other than those of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the Soviet Unions,'' he said without elaboration. The Iranians claim they soon will build their own combat jets. But Western analysts believe these will be Chinese-supplied F-6 and F-7 jets, <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s versions of the MiG-19 and MiG-21, shipped in parts to be assembled in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sources have reported that <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s links with the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact countries for arms supplies have improved prospects for co-producation deals under which <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> could build Soviet bloc weapons under license They estimate <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is spending up to $ 5 billion a year on its forces.

 Tens of thousands of people marched through the capital Monday to celebrate May Day and the rebirth of Solidarity in the union's biggest show of strength since it regained legal status. While the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> march was generally peaceful, troops used clubs, water cannons and tear gas to crush other demonstrations in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> and Wroclaw, dissident sources said. A minor clash was reported in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> later Monday. An estimated 100,000 people took part in the Solidarity march from northern <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> and the rally afterward. The Communist Party's official May Day rally nearby was more subdued and drew about 20,000 people Red-and-white Solidarity banners vied for attention with the red flags displayed by <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> faithful. Union supporters marched in a procession that took nearly an hour to pass a single point. Chants of `` Down with communism!'' `` Soviets go home!'' `` Free elections!'' and `` Solidarity must win!'' echoed off the buildings of narrow streets. The march began with about 30,000 people and was tripled in size by the time it reached a park on the banks of the <LOCATION> Vistula </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>'s center. Participants trumpeted last month's accord with the government, which resulted in Solidarity's legalization after an eight-year ban and provisions allowing non-communists to participate in coming parliamentary elections. <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Solidarity leader <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Bujak </PERSON> introduced the union's candidates to the two legislative houses `` We not only can organize uprisings ... We can also build a normal democratic order,'' he told the crowd. The Solidarity gathering was by far the union's biggest since it regained legal status on April 17. Participants signed nominating petitions for union-backed candidates to the two chambers of the congress, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and the Seijm. Some radical factions of Solidarity that joined the rally called for boycotting the June elections. `` The Sejm and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Are Yours, the Factories Are Ours,'' read one banner. But the crowd loudly booed <PERSON> Seweryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaworkski </PERSON>, a leader of a splinter faction supporting a boycott, when he was allowed to speak. The crowd instead began to chant the name of Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>. The government, faced with a crumbling economy, agreed to give the Solidarity-led opposition a greater voice in order to win workers' cooperation on economic reforms. `` We have entered a path of substantial reforms. We have dared to do an extraordinary thing,'' Polish leader Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> told the participants in the official May Day rally in Victory Square. `` Let's therefore close the Polish book of sorrows and bitterness,'' he said. `` What the country needs most is peace and joint action.'' Police used tear gas, water cannons and clubs to crush a rally in Wroclaw organized by the splinter group <ORGANIZATION> Fighting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION> and the banned <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party-Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolution </ORGANIZATION>, said opposition spokeswoman <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinior </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, riot police with batons attacked participants in a rally that included several banned groups, said Solidarity spokeswoman <PERSON> Joanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Wojciechowicz </PERSON>. The street fighting lasted for several hours, she said. There was no information available on arrests or injuries. Earlier, at a rally of about 1,000 people in <LOCATION> Gdanski </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> was accused of betraying the movement he founded by <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Walentynowicz </PERSON>, a woman whose firing from the <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> shipyard caused the strike that led to Solidarity's formation in 1980. Ms. <PERSON> Walentynowicz </PERSON> denounced <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s agreement with authorities on social and economic reform. <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>'s main Solidarity events were peaceful, but later in the day at least one small clash took place between police and about 100 militant young marchers in central <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. Police charged the rock-throwing demonstrators and dispersed them.

 Former arms negotiator <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Warnke </PERSON> criticized the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration on Monday for failing to assert leadership and avert an argument raging in the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance over short-range nuclear weapons. `` There has been no American leadership whatsoever,'' said <PERSON> Warnke </PERSON>, and as a result, `` we have a very sharp dispute over a silly issue.'' <PERSON> Warnke </PERSON>, chief arms negotiator for then-President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, recommended that the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> stick to agreements reached in the alliance in 1987 and 1988 to modernize <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Lance tactical missiles in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. At the same time, <PERSON> Warnke </PERSON> said, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> should open negotiations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> about eliminating the entire class of nuclear missiles with ranges of under 300 miles and therefore not subject to the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Force pact, which took effect last year. The dispute over modernizing short-range nuclear weapons has pitted West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> against <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> held what they called frank and intensive talks on the issue Sunday in <LOCATION> Deidesheim </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, but parted in disagreement. `` We still have quite a lot of work to do,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said after the meeting, although predicting that an agreement was possible before a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, this month. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, whose party faces tough elections next year, wants <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> to begin negotiations with the Soviet bloc on the issue and to delay until at least 1992 a decision on Lance modernization. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said eliminating short-range nuclear weapons would mean that the `` <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will have achieved its objective of getting land-based nuclear weapons out of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. This, I believe, would be disastrous.'' <PERSON> Warnke </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> could finesse the issue by entering negotiations while stipulating that the Western alliance would not eliminate its short-range nuclear weapons until the Soviet-led <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> sharply reduced its conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, thereby removing the threat that the <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> is intended to deal with, said <PERSON> Warnke </PERSON>. `` The existing short-range force should not be a priority,'' <PERSON> Warnke </PERSON> said at a breakfast meeting with reporters. `` It does not seem to me that we need either to eliminate or modernize tactical nuclear systems.'' `` They can only be used if the Russians invade Western Euroupe. ... You are not going to blow up the men's room in the Kremlin'' with the <PERSON> Lance </PERSON>, which can not reach beyond German borders, said <PERSON> Warnke </PERSON>, who was assistant secretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> from 1967 through 1969 and the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disarmament </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> in 1977 and 1978. <PERSON> Warnke </PERSON> also urged the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> adminstration to move more quickly to take advantage of conventional arms concesssions made by Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who last December announced a cut of 500,000 troops in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> forces and the withdrawal of 50,000 Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Pope Attacks `Contraceptive Imperialism,' Arrives on French Isle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEPHEN R. WILSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ST. DENIS, Reunion (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> flew to this French <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> island Monday after urging his flock in the impoverished African nation of <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION> to reject `` contraceptive imperialism'' and abortion. The pope arrived on this volcanic island, about 450 miles east of <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION>, on the second stop of a nine-day tour that will also take him to the African nations of <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION>. He was greeted at the airport by French Prime Minister <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> and a <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> military band playing the Marseillaise. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> then rode in his glass-enclosed popemobile to the municipal building to meet privately with <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> and address political and church officials. He later spoke to local clergy at the 19th century cathedral and had dinner with bishops from Reunion, <LOCATION> Mauritius </LOCATION> and the Seyechelles. Earlier Monday, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> concluded a three-day visit to <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION> with an open-air Mass for about 100,000 people in <LOCATION> Fianarantsoa </LOCATION>, a wine-producing town in the south of the island. He devoted much of his homily to birth control, a pressing issue in <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION>, where the average citizen earns $ 250 a year and the population of 11 million is growing at an annual rate of 3 percent. Only one in 100 married women in <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION> uses contraception, according to the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Watch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, and Western aid agencies have sought to promote the use of artificial birth control. `` The power to transmit life must be respected,'' said the white-robed pontiff, speaking in French from a wooden altar overlooking a dirt field near the airport. `` You can not let yourselves be won over by the increasing tendency to consider it -LRB- child-bearing -RRB- secondary, or even to want to prevent human fertility from expressing itself.'' The <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said that, if it is necessary for couples to choose family planning, they must follow `` methods that respect nature.'' He was referring to the only method approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, natural family planning based on abstinence during a woman's fertile period. `` The teaching of the church seems difficult. But many couples testify that it is possible to follow it and that it is even a liberation compared to what we call ` contraceptive imperialism.''' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> also decried abortion, saying families must `` respect the life of the child from conception.'' `` Do not accept that abortion is commonplace. Take care of the fragile but human life of the unborn child ... the dignity of man is at stake.'' Before the ceremony, the pope blessed lepers kneeling in the sand at the foot of the altar, patting each of them on the head. They came from a nearby leper clinic founded in 1912 by a Polish Jesuit missionary, <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Beyzym </PERSON>. `` I would like to say to those suffering from leprosy and other illnesses ... how much the church wants to bring them consolation and comfort. How much she loves them.'' Addressing officials in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Denis </LOCATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> told islanders they should `` rethink certain ways of life.'' He did n't elaborate but local church officials have expressed concern about consumerisim and materialism as well as superstition, exorcism and satanic cults. Reunion, covering 970 square miles, has been a French Overseas Department since 1946. It is the richest of the countries on the pope's trip as a tourist attraction and sugar exporter and also has the highest percentage of Catholics _ 90 percent of the 500,000 population. Seventy percent of its people are descendants of the African slaves brought to the island by the French in the 1600s.

<HEAD>U.S. Protests Illegal Driftnet Fishing by Taiwanese</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has told the Taiwanese that their relationship with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could suffer unless they curb illegal driftnet fishing in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said Monday. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>, ambassador for oceans and fisheries, said he delivered a note of protest to an official of the Taiwanese <ORGANIZATION> Coordinating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> and warned of the possible fallout if the government of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> fails to negotiate a driftnet fishing agreement with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` I delivered a forceful message regarding the potential serious consequences of recent illegal fishing activities and the lack of Taiwanese cooperation on driftnet negotiations, specifically the enforcement aspect of those negotiations,'' said <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> said he told the Taiwanese that the fishing issue has attracted interest at the `` highest levels'' of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and called for an `` immediate resumption of negotiations to avoid potential bilateral foreign policy problems.'' The meeting Friday came about a week after the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> boarded a Taiwanese ship suspected of illegal driftnet fishing for salmon in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. The ship was spotted 450 miles outside the legal driftnet fishing zone in waters where the Taiwanese government itself has banned driftnetting. The ship allegedly cut its net and fled after being spotted by the cutter <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON> shadowed the vessel for almost 700 miles before receiving permission from the Taiwanese government to board. <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> said Monday that a fish scale and fin found on the ship have been sent to a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> laboratory to see if they were from a salmon of North American origin. American fishermen claim vessels from <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> use driftnets to illegally snare millions of tons of salmon under the guise of squid fishing. Fishing groups have said the illegal fishing has already hurt salmon runs in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. Driftnets can stretch 35 miles in length and cover more than 30,000 square miles of ocean on any given day. Environmentalist claim the nets are responsible for the deaths of thousands of porpoises, seals, seabirds and other marine life annually.

<HEAD>First Taiwan Delegation Visits China</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Officials from <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> arrived Monday on the first visit to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> by a Nationalist Chinese delegation since the communists won the civil war in 1949 and <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Kai-shek </PERSON>'s forces fled to the island. The 12-member delegation led by Finance Minister <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuo </PERSON> will attend the three-day annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> that begins in the Chinese capital Thursday. `` We're happy that <PERSON> Taipei-China </PERSON>, like any other member of the bank, will be able to attend this 22nd annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> ADB </ORGANIZATION>,'' said bank spokesman <PERSON> Reynaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Pacheko </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Kuo </PERSON> and the other delegation members went straight to the hotel where the conference will be held. <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION> officials have said the delegation's only purpose is to fulfill <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s obligations as a founding member of the <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and no official meetings will be held with the Communist government. Since the defeat in 1949, the Nationalists have had a policy of no contacts with mainland authorities. The bank meeting, however, continues a practice of raising the level of exchange that began with a softening of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s approach two years ago. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> lifted restrictions on visits to the mainland late last year and several thousand people have traveled to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for reunions, tourism or business. Indirect trade has grown rapidly, reaching an estimated $ 2.7 billion last year. Last month, young Taiwanese gymnasts became the first athletes from the island to compete on the mainland, opening the way for <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s participation in the 1990 Asian Games in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Only 23 countries recognize <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, while 136 have diplomatic ties with the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> government. The <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, a regional development institution established in 1966, is the only major international organization in which <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> holds membership. It had to accept a name change from <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION> - <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> when the 47-member organization admitted <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1986 Many in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, including members of the ruling party, see adherence to the official policy of no contact as an attempt to avoid the impression of eagerness until <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> is assured the communists will consider it more than a local government. `` If this is not an official contact, then what is it?'' legislator <PERSON> Huang </PERSON> <PERSON> Ho-ching </PERSON>, a liberal member of the <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said before the delegation left <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. As a joke, he offered to give Ms. <PERSON> Kuo </PERSON> a pair of gloves so she could shake hands with Chinese delegates without violating the government's directive against direct contact. Early in April, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> proposed that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> be considered a single nation with two governments, one in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and the other in <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION>. That would allow the island to rejoin international organizations as an equal. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> rejected the idea, saying it would require abandonment of the one-China policy.

<TEXT>
 Auditorium lights dimmed and thousands of youngsters nationwide went silent Monday when a $ 7 million science project whisked them to the bottom of the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, live and in color. Television screens showed them the satellite-relayed view of a camera-equipped submersible robot being towed over the ocean floor. It was the first of two weeks of live broadcasts to an expected 250,000 students at 13 museums from <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. The project suffered a temporary setback last week when the 7-foot-long robot <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>, a newer version of the camera-carrying submersible that explored the sunken ocean liner Titanic, sank among the ruins of an ancient Roman trading ship off the coast of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. The cable used to lower the million-dollar <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> and its mobile garage or transporter, Argo, snapped and the pair plunged 2,100 feet to the soft, silty ocean floor. Organizers said the show would go on _ with or without <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>. The robot was resurrected apparently undamaged Saturday but still was n't used in Monday's 40-minute broadcast. <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> has propellers and can be remotely guided in and around underwater objects. Its replacement Monday, <PERSON> Medea </PERSON>, was merely a sophisticated camera platform that is towed over a target area from the surface. In addition to the underwater shots, expedition leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON>, discoverer of the Titanic, talked to the students from the bridge of the support ship Star Hercules in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. He took questions from students at three of the 13 participating museums, narrated live footage of underwater volcanoes and introduced films on satellite technology and the ancient Greek voyager <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>, for whom the 20th-century undersea robot was named. `` Our journey to the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> has been anything but uneventful,'' <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> said in recounting <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>'s mishap. `` The voyage became a nonstop exercise in problem-solving.'' During weeks of lessons and classroom discussion, the students have developed an affection for the little robot explorer. The biggest laugh of the morning came when a boy identified only as <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON>, a grade-school student from <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, got to question <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON>. `` Is <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> alright?'' he asked. `` <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> is fine,'' <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> said. `` His pride's a little hurt but luckily none of his instrumentation is.'' <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Tardiff </PERSON>, a seventh grader from <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, said word of <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>'s loss last week spread rapidly through the Shore Country Day School. `` We were crushed,'' the 13-year-old said. `` We thought the whole thing would be called off.'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> said he was `` thrilled'' with the show's premiere, although disappointed that the slightly less than state-of-the-art stand-in took <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>'s place. `` <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> is the superior robot and probably could have picked a bigger variety of images,'' he said. `` But it was still a pretty impressive show.'' For some of the kids, too, the show was n't quite the same without <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>. `` The teachers said it was going to be so real that it would seem like the water could come right off the screen,'' said 10-year-old <PERSON> Almas </PERSON> <PERSON> Rathod </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Shrewsbury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. `` It was n't like that.'' But classmate <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyall </PERSON> said it met his expectations. `` It's much more interesting than hearing about it in a classroom,'' the 9-year-old native of <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> said. `` It was the next best thing to being there.'' The project sponsors include <ORGANIZATION> Woods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION>. In addition to Woods Hole, participating museums are The <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> History </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>; the Discovery Place in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>; The Science Place in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION> -RRB- Pink Palace Museum; The <ORGANIZATION> Franklin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>; the <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> -RRB- Museum and Science Center; <ORGANIZATION> Mote </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grosvenor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auditorium </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>; and the <LOCATION> Royal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Museum </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The leader of <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s southern rebel movement announced Monday a conditional monthlong cease-fire, which he called a goodwill gesture toward ending a six-year civil war. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Garang </PERSON>, a renegade army colonel who leads the rebels, said the unilateral truce will hold only as long as the government carries out no troop movements in the war-torn south. This includes reinforcing beleaguered army forces in the region, he said. There was no immediate government response to his offer, which follows weeks of successes for the rebel <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. Several government garrisons, including in the largest southern town of <LOCATION> Juba </LOCATION>, are under severe pressure. In a statement broadcast by clandestine <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SPLA </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Garang </PERSON> said he has ordered his forces to `` remain in their present positions'' throughout May. Army troops must do likewise, he said, but added a formula could be worked out to allow provision of non-military supplies. `` Our people are suffering. It is our responsibility to end the war,'' he said on the broadcast from <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> and monitored in <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>, the Sudanese capital. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in April began a relief operation to ease a war-induced famine and the flight of potential victims. <PERSON> Garang </PERSON> refused overtures to declare a `` month of tranquillity'' in the south, but he did agree to allow passage of goods through specified corridors. Unidentified attackers twice have ambushed <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> food convoys since then. On Monday, ambushers sprayed a vehicle with small arms fire near the rebel-held town of <LOCATION> Kapoeta </LOCATION>. On April 18, a convoy was hit by a rocket and automatic weapons fire, also near <LOCATION> Kapoeta </LOCATION>. Eight armed rebel escorts were killed in that attack. <PERSON> Garang </PERSON> said the cease-fire will be extended if necessary and called on the Sudanese government to reciprocate. He said his fighters will `` wait for the government to implement the requirements of the Sudanese peace initiative, after which a comprehensive cease-fire will be worked out.'' In November, the rebels signed an agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unionist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> calling for the suspension of harsh Islamic laws and a constitutional conference of all political powers. Prime Minister <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> initially refused to submit the agreement to his Cabinet for endorsement. After pressure from the army and professional organizations and trade unions, he formed a new, broader-based government and won parliament's approval to suspend the 1,400-year-old Islamic penal code. The rebels started fighting in 1983 against the Moslem-dominated government, demanding social and economic reforms for the minority Christians and animists of the south.

<HEAD>Anti-Apartheid Activist Killed Outside His Home</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A white anti-apartheid activist was shot and killed Monday outside his home by an assailant firing from a passing car, police said. Colleagues said they had no doubt that <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>, 44, was assassinated because of his political activities. <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>, a lecturer in social anthropology at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witwatersrand </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> and a prominent member of several anti-apartheid organizations, was a leading opponent of the government's policy of detention without trial and held periodic tea parties for the families of detained black activists. Police said <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> died almost instantly after he was hit in the back by a bullet fired from a heavy-caliber weapon outside his home in the <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> neighborhood of <LOCATION> Troyeville </LOCATION>. Nothing was known about the assailant, police added With <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> at the time was <PERSON> Maggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, a friend and fellow member of the <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, a Johannesburg-based monitoring group established by anti-apartheid activists last year. She said <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> was shot after they had returned from buying plants at a nursery. She said she heard a noise from a passing car which she thought had backfired, then saw <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> stagger and tell her: `` I've been shot with a shotgun. Get an ambulance.'' `` It is clear to me that his killing was a highly professional job,'' she said. `` I find it frightening that those who opposed him were prepared to go to such lengths to eliminate someone.'' Dozens of black activists have been killed in recent years in unsolved murders. The Five Freedoms Forum, a human rights groups with which <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> worked, described Monday's killing as one of the first assassinations of a white activist. `` We are deeply shocked by this blatant assassination of our dear comrade,'' said <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Valli </PERSON> <PERSON> Moosa </PERSON>, a former detainee who serves as unofficial spokesman for major anti-apartheid groups. `` We are concerned that his death comes as a result of unflinching opposition to the system of apartheid,'' <PERSON> Valli </PERSON> <PERSON> Moosa </PERSON> said. `` The only beneficiaries of his death are those who have an interest in perpetuating this evil system.''

<TEXT>
 Scientists on Monday aborted the launch of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s first medium-range ballistic missile seconds before it was to lift off when computers detected an error in one of the rocket's systems, officials said. One military official said a problem developed in the liquid fuel propellant of the $ 6 million missile and there would have been `` a big disaster'' had the countdown reached zero. It was the second time in 11 days that scientists postponed the test-firing of the missile, which experts say has the capability to carry a nuclear warhead. The postponement was met by cheers and the blowing of conch shells by many of the 12,000 villagers who were temporarily evacuated from their homes around the launch site in this eastern Indian town overlooking the Bay of <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION>. A government statement issued at the remote seaside missile center said the launch was called off when computers detected the data error. `` It is not a major fault,'' said V.S. <PERSON> Arunachalam </PERSON>, scientific adviser to the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and head of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s missile program at the launch site. But a military official said scientists detected a leak in the missile's liquid fuel propellant 11 seconds before the scheduled firing. `` Had the scientists counted to zero it would have ended in a big disaster,'' the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. A previous attempt to fire the missile on April 20 was called off because of a snag in the ignition system. Military sources said the missile would likely be dismantled and every part checked before a third attempt is made. Scientists will postpone the launch for at least one week, the sources said. Before the launch, angry residents said prayers and held special ceremonies beseeching Hindu gods and goddesses to prevent the missile from being fired. The villagers fear they will be permanently shifted from their homes if the missile launch is successful and the test range is used for more firings. The 7 -LCB- - ton surface-to-surface missile has a range of 1,550 miles, Indian military experts say Its first stage is boosted by a solid fuel propellant engine and its second stage is powered by a liquid fuel engine. The range is sufficient to hit targets as far as <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in the west, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> in the east, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in the north and islands around the equator in the south, Western military officials said. The missile, named `` Agni,'' or `` fire'' in Hindi, can hit any target in neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s longstanding adversary. The two countries have fought three wars in the past 42 years. Defense experts said the one-ton payload capability is more than enough for the missile to carry a nuclear warhead. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has said its nuclear capacity will be used only for peaceful purposes. But Western military experts in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> said if <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> ever uses the missile in a war, it might not carry a conventional warhead. `` You need accuracy or a point target if you are using a conventional warhead,'' said one Western analyst, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` But if you are using a nuclear warhead, the exact target does not matter.'' <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> exploded a nuclear device 15 years ago, and Western experts estimate it would take Indian scientists one week to assemble a nuclear device.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Monday he hopes Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> succeeds in his economic reforms, and the White House brushed aside <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>'s prediction that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> would fail Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>'s remarks, in a weekend broadcast interview, were merely his own `` personal observations'' and did not reflect the views of the administration, which has adopted a public posture of trying to encourage Soviet reforms. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, speaking to the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` Even the socialist world is beginning to see that socialism is n't just another economic system _ it's the death of economics. And there is a new breeze blowing.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he told <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> last year `` we wanted to see perestroika -LRB- economic reforms -RRB- succeed in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. And likewise, we want to see success for the economic reforms in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.'' The president did not mention <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> or his remarks. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said he did not think <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> talked about the Soviet reforms because of <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION>'s comments. Rather, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` it was a natural fit'' in a speech about economics. The White House and <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> joined forces to disassociate the administration from <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION>, who had said of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, `` If I had to guess today, I would guess he ultimately would fail.'' In the broadcast interview, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> secretary predicted <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> then would be replaced by someone `` far more hostile'' toward the West. Last Tuesday, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> made similar remarks during testimony before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. He predicted `` a very real likelihood'' that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reform plans would fail and that the Soviet leader may either be forced to change course or hand over power. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that as a result, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies must resist the temptation to respond to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s proposals for reducing arsenals and troop strengths and stick to the policies it has advocated until now In his speech, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said reform efforts in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and other socialist countries were part of `` an exciting trend and in my view it will continue.'' `` Whenever in the world there is economic reform, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should be hoping that that reform succeeds. Economic reform, with its emphasis on incentive and market economics, leads to more freedom,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He joked that the May Day parade in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> had included a delegation from the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> _ 200 economists marching along yelling `` May Day, May Day.'' However, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` Today that is beginning to change.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` The administration's position on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, whether expressed by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, Secretary <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> or Secretary <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, reflects the view that we want reform to succeed. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, asked about <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>'s comments, said: `` I do n't know what his motivation was. In reading it -LRB- the transcript -RRB-, it looks like it was just a question that came up in the interview when he offered his personal observations. I'm sure it was n't part of any grand strategy.'' He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had not talked with <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> about the matter. On another subject, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> did not plan to release documents that would buttress <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s contention that there was no link between his March 1985 meeting in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and that country's support for the Contra rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and others involved in that meeting `` have all said there was no quid pro quo associated with the vice president's trip to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. However, there is no campaign to publicize information,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. On <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, said he has not changed his mind about the need for a review of whether the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> White House withheld documents or other key information from the congressional investigation of the secret arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and aid to the Contras. `` We'll have the <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> look into that,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. `` Questions have arisen that I think ought to be answered ... I think the <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> will make a thorough review of the matter.''

 Mourners gathered Monday at a funeral for a brain-damaged baby who died after his father disconnected his life support, while the father's attorneys worked on his defense against a charge of murder. Sixteen-month-old <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Linares </PERSON> was buried in a white casket adorned with angels, after a 45-minute funeral service attended by about 80 mourners at a church just blocks from the family's home in this suburb west of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` I am sure God weeps when he sees what happened to <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON>,'' the Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>, pastor of <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Queen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heaven </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, said in his eulogy. `` We think we can control our destiny ... and then something like this happens _ death comes, pain and suffering come,'' Price said. `` And then we know in a flash ... that we ca n't control our lives.

 Workers strode through Red Square in a tightly controlled May Day march Monday, but Soviet Armenians defied a ban and rallied in their capital, thanking the world for helping them dig out of a deadly earthquake. Thousands of Armenians gathered in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> to express gratitude for foreign aid that followed the Dec. 7 earthquake that killed an estimated 25,000 people, the government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> reported. Authorities had banned the traditional celebrations in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>, the capital of the Soviet republic of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, because of pro-independance unrest in both cities and because of the Armenian earthquake. Armenian activist <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Popoyan </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> march was massive but peaceful. He said participants demanded freedom for jailed members of a group leading the effort to annex <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, a disputed region in the neighboring republic of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Kishinev </LOCATION>, capital of the republic of <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION>, youths boycotted a rally after student activists were refused their own column in that city's parade, <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said. The tiny republic on the Romanian border has been the scene of several demonstrations and some violence in recent months as activists have pressed for greater independence from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, howver, the mood was decidedly upbeat under bright skies, with the traditional Red Square parade highlighting the official tribute to workers of the world. The emphasis was on progress at home, and there were no direct references to international issues or the Soviet troop withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Access to Red Square is severely restricted for such events, and the vast majority of Soviets who saw the two-hour parade did so via television. In an article coinciding with the holiday, the daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> charged Monday that Soviet trade unions are mere government puppets that do n't protect workers' rights. The newspaper, which specializes in labor and economics, called for giving labor organizations greater independence. President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and members of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling Politburo stood atop <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION>'s tomb to view festivities as thousands of marchers passed through Red Square waving banners, pushing floats and releasing helium-filled balloons. His wife, <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON>, was absent from the festivities that she has attended in the past. There was no explanation. In a section reserved for government dignitaries stood <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, the maverick ousted as <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party boss and removed from the Politburo last year. He made a remarkable comeback by winning a popular election to represent <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in the new parliament that meets May 25. Signs and banners boosted `` perestroika,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s program to overhaul and modernize Soviet society. There also was increased attention paid to the environment. `` To the coming generations: a clean planet,'' pledged one banner. In one solemn passage, the parade announcer called for participants to remember those who died in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and the Soviet submarine accident last month in the <LOCATION> Norwegian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. `` It seems that one can hear at the square even now echoes of requiems that have not died away in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>,'' he said, `` and the cold sea has not yet dried its salty tears mourning those heroes, submariners, who perished ...'' <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> has been under curfew for more than six months to curb ethnic rivalries that killed more than 90 people in <LOCATION> Armennia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> last year. About 20 people died in pro-independence unrest in <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> last month, and 42 sailors were killed in the submarine tragedy.

 Forty American and Soviet poets and short story writers celebrated glasnost on Monday by announcing the publication of a 345-page anthology of some of their best works, which author <PERSON> Bel </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> called `` an exchange of our common humanity.'' The English-language edition of the book, titled `` The Human Experience,'' is published domestically by <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Knopf </PERSON> for $ 19.95. The Russian-language version will be sold to Soviet readers for two rubles each, or about $ 3.30. Published under the auspices of the <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> @ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, a Philadelphia-based organization that promotes contacts between the two countries, the anthology is the first joint Soviet-American venture in publishing fiction. Contributing American writers and poets include <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Updike </PERSON>, <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Oates </PERSON>, <PERSON> Garrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Keillor </PERSON>, <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sayles </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunitz </PERSON>. Their Soviet counterparts include <PERSON> Evgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Yevtushenko </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tatiana </PERSON> <PERSON> Tolstaya </PERSON>, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Kushner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vasily </PERSON> <PERSON> Belov </PERSON>. `` The book has to do with our common feelings _ love, hate, envy, worry about our children, life and death,'' Ms. <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> told a news conference at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. `` That's what will bring us together, more than politics or polemics.'' Soviet publisher <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Andjaparidze </PERSON> said the anthology will allow the people of both countries `` to get to know each other and understand each other'' in sharing such mundane concerns as `` getting up with the alarm clock every morning, finding a job, falling in love.'' `` There is nothing in this book about politics or ideology,'' he said. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Worrall </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, clerk of the Quaker committee, said the book owes much to <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s glasnost policy of opening up Soviet society and culture. `` We owe it all to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and the Quakers,'' said <PERSON> Andjaparidze </PERSON>, who is editor of the <LOCATION> Khudozhestvennaya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Literatura </LOCATION> publishing house in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Some of the writers represented in the book, 20 from each country, will begin three days of informal consultations Tuesday at the Quaker meeting house in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Among their other scheduled activities are receptions at the <ORGANIZATION> Folger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shakespeare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> and a poetry reading at the Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Prominent Soviet literary figure <PERSON> Tatiana </PERSON> <PERSON> Kudryaviseva </PERSON> said the easiest American writers to translate into Russian are <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheever </PERSON>, whose prose is `` crystal clear,'' and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Styron </PERSON>, whose literary style reminds her of the great Russian novelist <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tolstoy </PERSON>. She said it is more difficult to translate the works of <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Barthelme </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Oates </PERSON> because of their unusual literary images and use of American slang. In a foreword to the book, <PERSON> Styron </PERSON> wrote that the joint literary project `` may be symbolic of an even greater and more lasting solidarity, as <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> choose friendship over the folly of perpetual strife.'' In a separate foreword, Soviet novelist <PERSON> Daniil </PERSON> <PERSON> Granin </PERSON> wrote that `` feeling the oneness of the earth and recognizing your own thoughts and feelings in other people is the best pathway to trust.''

 Israeli professors Monday protested the 15-month closure of Palestinian universities and called the measure an unwarranted collective punishment that threatens peace efforts. `` Even though closing the universities does n't kill or maim, it causes serious injury to the fabric of any society,'' said <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Gavison </PERSON>, a law professor at <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` It disturbs life in a way that is far reaching.'' Israeli military authorities closed <ORGANIZATION> Bethlehem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> on Oct. 29, 1987, and by February 1988 had shut the remaining Palestinian universities in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. About 18,000 students are affected. Authorities called the colleges breeding grounds for anti-Israeli protests. But the 1,200 professors from Israeli universities said the closures threatened efforts to find moderate Palestinians with which to negotiate an end to their 16-month uprising. At least 457 Arabs and 18 Israelis have died in clashes, mostly in the occupied territories. `` Universities are the only place the moderate elements of the Palestinian community can develop,'' said <PERSON> Hava </PERSON> <PERSON> Lazarus-Yafeh </PERSON>, a professor of Asian and African studies at <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` Otherwise Palestinian leaders grow in prisons ... and leaders who grow in jail tend to be more violent,'' she said. State-run primary and secondary schools in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> have also been closed for all but a few weeks since Feb. 4, 1988. Kindergarten, first - and second-grade classes in some private schools were allowed to reopen earlier this year Authorities barred home study for university students and refused to allow them to use college facilities such as laboratories or libraries, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kretzmer </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> law professor. Recently, a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> university was refused permission to open its Library, he said. `` It is hard to understand how opening a library to librarians could endanger security,'' <PERSON> Kretzmer </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s Ms. <PERSON> Gavison </PERSON> called the closures a `` far-reaching collective measure.'' `` Necessary security measures should be taken not against institutions but against those individuals who have may have violated order,'' she said. The longterm closures violate international statutes, such as the <ORGANIZATION> Geneva </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION>, which governs the treatment of people under occupation, <PERSON> Kretzmer </PERSON> said. He said that a 1982 Israeli <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling determined military closures of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> schools could not surpass a reasonable period.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s Vietnamese-installed government has changed the country's name and flag, and invited its banished prince to return home and help rule. In nearby <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, resistance leader Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> welcomed the concessions and appeared ready to make a few of his own to end the 10-year conflict. `` It seems that we are at the end of the tunnel. We are going to make progress on the way toward a settlement,'' <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> said on Monday, the eve of new peace talks. Prime Minister <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> invited <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> to abandon his <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> allies and `` join us.'' The official Cambodian news agency <ORGANIZATION> SPK </ORGANIZATION> Monday quoted <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> as promising <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> will have real power if he returns to <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>. The comments, made at a <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> news conference Saturday, appeared tailored for the peace talks in <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION>, which now are expected to last longer than a day. <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> stopped in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> on his way to <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION> on Monday and told reporters the changes are concessions to help settle the war. He too said he was confident of success in the talks with <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>. He said that on Sunday, the National Assembly unanimously adopted constitutional amendments changing the `` People's Republic of Kampuchea'' to `` The State of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> sported a model of the new flag: the top half is red, the bottom is blue and a gold image of Angkor Wat temple is in the center. A new national anthem and coat of arms also are in the works, he said. His government was installed by Vietnamese forces that invaded the country in late 1978 and toppled the brutal <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> regime. It is battling a coalition of three guerrilla groups led by <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>. Diplomats say the changes are to strengthen the government's domestic and international support as it begins to confront the resistance without the help of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> announced last month that it will withdraw its troops by Sept. 30 to encourage a political settlement in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> and other resistance officials in the past have demanded not only changing the country's name and flag, but also dismantling the government before general elections. On Monday, <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> said he would not insist on this, or <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> supervision of the Vietnamese withdrawal, so long as an adequate power-sharing formula can be found.

<HEAD>FSX Settlement Avoided Rift, Says New U.S. Envoy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> averted a potentially serious rift in U.S.-Japanese relations by going ahead with the controversial agreement for the two countries to develop jointly a new jet fighter for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the new American ambassador to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> said Monday. Ambassador <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> told reporters that despite persistent, strong objections to the project on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, `` I'm confident it will meet with the acquiescence of our <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced Friday that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> intends to proceed with the FSX fighter program because it is `` in the strategic and commercial interests of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' After taking office in January, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ordered a review of the $ 7 billion project negotiated under his predecessor, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Critics in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> have said it amounts to a giveaway of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> high technology and have said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> should make an `` off-the-shelf'' aircraft purchase, as do other nations that are <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> customers. <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> brought up the negative side of scrapping the agreement in an appearance at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Foreign Press Center on the eve of his departure for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, where he is due next week. Proceeding with the FSX project `` is important from our standpoint because of what it avoided, namely -LRB- <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> -RRB- going down separate tracks,'' he said. `` It avoids what could have been an important breach in our relationship if this deal had gone awry.'' The FSX agreement `` is a good arrangement for both our governments. We have had coproduction in past, but major codevelopment is in a sense the first'' such arrangement with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON>, a former undersecretary of state for political affairs. `` I hope this will be a model of the flow of two-way technology which is quite appropriate to a more mature relationship between our countries in this field,'' the ambassador said. The White House said Monday that, with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` has been very tough in demanding equity for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in terms of its commercial interests,'' and he `` was successful in getting everything he asked for.'' Friday's announcement said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies would be guaranteed about 40 percent of the production work on the planned 130 new fighters while certain computer codes from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> F-16 jet, which provides the model for the FSX, would be withheld.

<HEAD>County's Land Giveaway Plan Turning Sour</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INTERNATIONAL FALLS, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A northern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> <LOCATION> county </LOCATION>'s attempt to boost its population with a land giveaway program brought thousands of responses from around the world It also brought complaints and legal snags that threaten the program. `` We're getting tremendous pressure to shut down the program,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Biggins </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Koochiching </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> commissioner who heads the homestead authority. `` We got into it in good faith, but we've taken a tremendous amount of flak. Among the problems are resentment from longtime county residents; far less available land than originally planned; reluctance by bankers to make construction loans and an overwhelming demand. `` You have a whole lot of people out there really, really desperate for a new way of life,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Chezick </PERSON>, a county commissioner. `` It frankly swamped us. We did n't field-test it before the media got onto it.'' The international publicity of the program drew people to the area who had not received approval to homestead. Last winter, three homesteading hopefuls from <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> were arrested trying to break into an empty farmhouse. Another time, two Germans wandered into the local <ORGANIZATION> Job </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> office, saying they intended to homestead and needed work. `` On paper, the whole idea looks good, but the reality does n't live up to it,'' said Sheriff <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON>, who received calls from police officers around the country who were interested in the program For a while, the homesteading office had to hire receptionists who could speak German to handle the overseas requests. More than 10,000 people asked for information about the program, about one-fourth of whom sent $ 10 to receive an application. About 250 people followed through with an application, and only two homesteaders have received their 40-acre parcels. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 24, one of the homesteaders, said he had trouble finding bank financing for the house he wants to build. The land ca n't be used as collateral because under the program homesteaders do not receive title to it until they live there for 10 years. `` We've tried to get that across to them since the beginning,'' said <PERSON> Marlys </PERSON> <PERSON> Raboin </PERSON>, senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Falls </ORGANIZATION>. `` If you ca n't finance the property, the program just is n't workable.'' The program has turned out to be unworkable in other ways because homesteaders were mistakenly told that about 50,000 acres of tax-forfeited county lands and state lands were available. But it was later discovered that most of the state land ca n't be given away because it's held in trust. Officials say now it is not clear exactly how much land they are entitled to give away. Some sites also might have mineral leases or significant waterfront property that could prevent them from being given away, said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hummitzch </PERSON>, the county's land commissioner. Program officials said they were extremely selective in choosing participants, but some local residents have their doubts.

<HEAD>Customs Announces Proposal in Drive to Prevent Smuggling by Air and
Sea</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> proposed on Monday that the government, unions and airline and shipping industries unite in a drive to prevent drug smuggling by air and sea. It would be `` the first time that industry, labor and government have joined together to put together a plan to combat drug smuggling,'' Customs Commissioner <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said before meeting with representatives of about 100 air and sea carriers where the plan was outlined. <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> estimated that 30 percent of the cocaine coming into the country is entering in containers. He said he expected that to reach 50 percent in the next two years and up to 80 percent to 90 percent by 1992 because of a crackdown on other forms of trafficking. The plan seeks to `` prevent drugs from being put on board'' at foreign ports, said <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Razzino </PERSON>, the agency's program manager for narcotics interdiction in commercial cargo. `` Prevent is the key word. Up until now, we've been talking interdiction,'' he added. At the meeting, a longshoremen's union leader said union members might refuse to unload any cargo from drug-producing countries if they do n't curtail the illegal trafficking. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowers </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Longshoreman </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said some foreign countries do n't even care `` whether drugs are going on these ships. He added that his members are `` saying that if they think they can use those ships as the dumping grounds in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for their drugs, then we're going to put on a boycott. ... We know we'd lose wages We'd rather lose wages than lose our children.'' He declined to say what criteria the union would use to refuse to unload ships. He noted that longshoremen had refused for 25 years to unload cargo from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and recently paid $ 9 million in fines because the union lost a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision over the boycott. The proposal outlined Monday calls for industries to impose strict security standards at foreign and domestic terminals and facilities and aboard their carriers. Customs would provide security training, surveys of foreign and domestic sites and help in identifying potential smuggling opportunities. Compliance with the voluntary agreement will be considered in assessing penalties or seizing a vehicle found to have illegal drugs after the pact is signed. The cost to each carrier has not been determined. Under the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, penalties for carrying illegal drugs went up to $ 1,000 per ounce of heroin and cocaine and $ 500 per ounce of marijuana. The law also authorized seizure of the carrier. Some carriers' representatives wanted a tariff imposed that would cover their costs for new security measures the agreement would demand, so they would remain competitive with carriers that do n't participate. <PERSON> Razzino </PERSON> said, however, that such a decision would be up to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Paper Blisters Soviet Labor Unions on May Day</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soviet trade unions serve to promote the government and the status quo instead of workers' rights, a newspaper said Monday in an article that injected some criticism of official bodies into May Day's labor pageantry. Under the headline `` What do we need a union for?'' economist <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Auzan </PERSON> compared the country's unions to a grandmother `` who makes a lot of fuss, interferes in everything, but who no one really listens to.'' The trade unions have been turned into `` a government maidservant concerned not with defending the interests of the workers, but only with maintaining peace and quiet and an imitation of ` mass support,''' <PERSON> Auzan </PERSON> wrote in Socialist Industry, the Soviet daily. Many Western unions long have said their Soviet counterparts have been co-opted by the government. President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> urged labor unions in 1987 to be more vigorous in defending rank-and-file workers. But increasing numbers of critics say the unions should prod bureaucrats more aggressively to improve housing, salaries and working conditions. Although some Soviet labor officials acknowledge failings of their unions, they have publicly ruled out forming independent trade organizations like <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s Solidarity. In his article, <PERSON> Auzan </PERSON> said unions should be given more independence and suggested they be decentralized. Unions should act as information clearing houses on vacancies and dislocated workers, set up retraining centers, and guarantee unemployment benefits, the economist said. He also called for union representatives elected to a new national <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies to press for a strike law to clarify what job actions are legal. In his criticisms of unions, <PERSON> Auzan </PERSON> said union leaders never `` fly urgently to the scene of a strike conflict or act as mediators between workers and government organs.'' Even though most strikes are prohibited, there have been increasing reports of workers walking off their jobs to demand higher pay or to protest working conditions. The economist also complained that membership in trade unions is `` practically universally obligatory,'' and he said many bookkeepers automatically deduct union dues from the salaries even of non-members. `` Enough of paying tribute to the union bureaucracy!'' he wrote.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> asked the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on Monday to seek world help to recover from the bottom of the <LOCATION> Norwegian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, one mile down, a wrecked submarine and its two nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons. A technical report commissioned by the environmental organization said the Soviet submarine on April 7 took `` a significant amount of highly active and toxic radioactive materials'' to the bottom, 5,296 feet beneath the surface. `` If the submarine is not recovered intact then it is, in our opinion, inevitable that all of this material will disperse to the marine environment,'' said the report by the independent nuclear engineering consultants <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Large </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Forty-two seamen were killed and 27 survived when the vessel, armed with two nuclear torpedoes and reportedly fueled by uranium 235, caught fire and sank 120 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Bear </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. The report said the nuclear reactors may have contained up to 20 million curies of radioactivity and the reactor hull parts 1 million curies. <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> said its figures are conservative because they do not include the radioactivity of the reactors' liquid metal coolant or the toxic plutonium of the torpedoes The No. 4 reactor at the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear power plant, by comparison, emitted an estimated 50 million curies of radiation after it caught fire in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in April 1986. The report said much of the radioactive material aboard the Mike Class submarine will continue to emit radiation and be harmful to marine and human life for many tens of thousands of years. `` This vast quantity of radioactivity is mainly from highly active materials which will remain highly toxic to organisms almost indefinitely,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Damian </PERSON> <PERSON> Durrant </PERSON>. `` Inevitably, they will be released and a proportion absorbed into the marine food chains, through fisheries and toward man. The only question is when the reactors breach and this process begins.'' Director <PERSON> Johan </PERSON> <PERSON> Baarli </PERSON> of the Norwegian <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radiation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> said in response to the report, `` There is no reason to doubt that the sub's reactor is in its containment. According to all information we have, there is no radiation leakage.'' The institute said last month that tests showed the submarine's reactors and weapons have apparently withstood tremendous water pressure Water samples collected near the submarine showed no radiation that could be attributed to it, the institute said. The Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted Deputy Prime Minister <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> Belovsov </PERSON> last month as saying a decision on whether to raise the submarine is months away. The report does not discuss the possible impact of leaked radioactivity on the marine environment. `` This requires a further study dependent on the provision of more information from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, as requested by <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> as well as the Norwegian government, but which neither have thus far received,'' <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> said. The report noted that when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> tried to raise a Soviet Golf Class nuclear submarine in 1974 the vessel broke in half. It said recovery should not be regarded as a `` quick technical fix for this or future nuclear submarine accidents'' and called for elimination of all 544 military nuclear reactors from ships and submarines worldwide.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Monday reaffirmed its insistence on the improvement of short-range nuclear missiles in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> despite the opposition of Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> and his government. There was no hint of compromise in the statement read by spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. She denied, however, that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials were irritated with <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> for trying to delay the modernization of the Lance missiles and artillery and for demanding <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to reduce the nuclear arsenal. `` Secretary -LRB- James A. -RRB- <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> is not upset,'' the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said. The rift was not healed during a weekend meeting in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> between <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, an ardent proponent of extending the range of the missiles as a way of deterring Soviet attack. `` We, of course, share the view of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION> that it would be a mistake to engage in negotiations on SNF -LRB- Short-range Nuclear Forces -RRB-,'' Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said. `` We also share the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION> view that we need to maintain an up-to-date land-based nuclear deterrent in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' She continued: `` We have a difference of opinion with other members of the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- alliance and we will be seeking to resolve the issue ...'' The statement's reference to ground-based missiles appeared to rule out a compromise under which the Lances in West German might be scaled back or withdrawn and their place in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> strategy taken by air-launched cruise missiles. It also suggested the West Germans have some support within <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. The dispute is causing strains in the alliance and could put a damper on President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s summit meeting in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> May 29-30 with the leaders of the 15 other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> countries. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> is due in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> on May 12 for previously scheduled talks with <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> officials and will discuss the tactical nuclear issue with Western foreign ministers. White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, asked about the impasse, said, `` our position remains that keeping the peace requires a strong <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance, and a policy of flexible response. We believe the vast Soviet superiority and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact conventional forces must be reduced before we can discuss reductions in short range nuclear weapons.'' `` The West German position demonstrates the special strength that <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> has,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` Our allies can debate quite vigorously these issues, yet maintain the basic strength of our unity.'' But, he continued, `` we believe very strongly in our position; we believe very strongly that flexible response is essential to the peace of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> quoted unnamed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials on Sunday as saying the <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> government was threatening <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s unity by pressing for speeding negotiations with the Soviets on the missiles and artillery The newspaper said the officials had grown increasingly irritated with <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> for trying to line up other European nations against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Behind the scenes the two sides are jockeying for support. The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> disclosed last week that all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassadors in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> capitals were instructed to outline the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position to the host governments to try to win them over. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is using the same approach.

<HEAD>Peruvian Guerrillas Kill Three Players at Soccer Match</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HUANCAYO, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Leftist guerrillas shot and killed three players at an amateur soccer match, police reported Monday, and the government announced it was prolonging an anti-guerrilla state of emergency. Police said a group of Shining Path guerrillas disrupted a soccer match Sunday between neighboring villages in <LOCATION> Cullpa </LOCATION>, on <LOCATION> Huancayo </LOCATION>'s western outskirts, and ordered 100 spectators and players to attend a lecture in the village square. The three men were shot when they refused to go along, police said. Extension of the state of emergency comes during the deadliest reign of violence so far in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s nine-year fight against leftist guerrillas. Nearly 1,000 people have been killed this year, including 86 on Friday. The measures take force when the current decree expires Wednesday. They affect <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> and parts of seven highland and jungle states where more than half of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s 21 million people live. States of emergency suspend citizens' rights to travel and meet freely, and permit government forces to conduct searches without warrants and hold suspects for 15 days without filing charges. The military can also assume direct political and police control in emergency zones. In 1982 <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION>, 235 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, became the first area placed under a state of emergency to resist the Mao-inspired Shining Path group, which began its insurgency two years earlier. The fighting spread, claiming more than 14,000 lives and prompting the government to extend the emergency zones.

 A witness against the defendant in the `` Night Stalker'' serial murder trial failed to tell the whole truth, the prosecutor in the case disclosed Monday. The unexpected move by Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Halpin </PERSON> stalled the opening of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>'s defense case as <PERSON> Halpin </PERSON> won permission to reopen his case to question the witness again.

It's not significant evidence.'' But he said he was duty-bound to reveal the omission, which he discovered after he rested his case April 13 and the judge ordered a two-week recess. <PERSON> Halpin </PERSON>, who had called 137 people to testify since opening his case Jan. 30, refused to identify the witness or describe the missing evidence. He said only that the witness told him `` the testimony was withheld to protect someone, to protect a woman.'' <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> had expected his attorney, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, to deliver his opening statement to the jury. `` If the district attorney is going to stop the procedures for this one witness, it must be very significant,'' <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> said outside court. But his co-counsel, <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, said it was not unusual to find out that a witness did n't tell the whole truth. `` Most witnesses fudge,'' he said. <PERSON> Halpin </PERSON> said the witness is not a victim or survivor of the Night Stalker attacks of 1985. He said that during the recess he asked that a few witnesses be interviewed again by investigators. `` There ware a couple of things concerning me,'' he said, `` a lot of hearsay floating around.''

 Disney-MGM Studios opened its $ 400 million theme park on Monday, hoping to lure the nostalgic to its version of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s golden era and thrill-seekers to rides that will take them to places like Catastrophe Canyon. The 135-acre complex blends filmmaking with backstage studio tours and ride-through, walk-through attractions. Movie and TV production began last summer on its three sprawling sound studios and backlot street scenes. The new attraction on the entertainment giant's 43-square-mile <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> resort complements its other two theme parks: the Magic Kingdom and Epcot Center. It has its own admission fee: $ 29 for adults and $ 23 for children 3 to 9. Disney Chairman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisner </PERSON> and comedian <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hope </PERSON> were on hand to do the opening day honors on an outdoor stage in front of a re-creation of <PERSON> Grauman </PERSON>'s Chinese Theater on <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION>. `` It's the largest theme park run by actors, or cartoon characters, unless you want to count <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>,'' joked Hope. `` The world you have entered was created by the <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> and is dedicated to <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> ... a world that never was and always will be,'' <PERSON> Eisner </PERSON> told the crowd. A <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> carpenter and his family led the way through the gates as the first visitors at the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> attraction. `` We wanted to be first and beat the crowd but never expected anything like this,'' said <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON>, 37, as he and his wife, two daughters and father-in-law strolled into the park. `` It's incredible,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON>, 37, about their back-to-back appearances on national television and meetings with a gamut of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> stars attending the grand-opening ceremonies. Disney officials would not disclose attendance figures, but at least 15,000 were expected for opening day. Most attractions were crowded, and <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> officials had to close the parking lot at 9:15 a.m., just an hour after opening. The lot was reopened at 2 p.m. <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> hopes to attract 3 million to 5 million visitors a year. The grand opening followed a star-studded weekend of parties and previews for 3,000 journalists and family members, plus thousands of other invited guests. Some 40 movie and television stars attended a Saturday night gala and paraded down the park's <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION> in vintage automobiles Saturday night. Among them were <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> <PERSON> Midler </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacall </PERSON>, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON>, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Costner </PERSON>. At the same time <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> was opening a new park, <PERSON> Eisner </PERSON> announced another project: a second nighttime entertainment attraction to be called <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boardwalk </ORGANIZATION>. It will have restaurants, retail shops and nightclubs reminiscent of <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in the 1930s and 1940s. Boardwalk is expected to open in 1992. The ambience is nostalgic, and the architecture is art deco, similar to oldtime <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and the newly restored <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> area. Major park features, in addition to the two-hour backstage tour, include The Great Movie Ride, the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular theater show, Catastrophe Canyon, a Monster Sound Show and an Animation Center. Disney had a full year's jump on a similar, but larger, complex that will be operated by <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> just a few miles down the road. The $ 500 million attraction is an outgrowth of the Universal Studio Tour in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and is owned by <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Movie and television production began there last fall and its tour portion is to open next May Officials of both parks downplay any talk of intense rivalry, although <PERSON> Eisner </PERSON> was once accused of stealing the idea of a studio tour from <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Eisner </PERSON> said over the weekend any bitterness between the two entertainment companies was `` a false media situation.''

<HEAD>Congress to Take Close Look at Request for More B-1 Money</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Lawmakers said Monday that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, painfully aware of the more than $ 20 billion invested in the B-1 bomber, will take a close look at an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> request for an additional $ 1.2 billion to correct major flaws. `` It does n't make a lot of sense not to make the B-1 work if you can do it,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Leath </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` We really have to put the arm on the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>.'' The service has proposed spending the extra $ 1.2 billion over five years to improve the B-1, the swing-wing plane resurrected by then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1981 as the answer to the aging of the nation's force of nuclear-armed bombers. The B-1B fleet has experienced major problems. Three of the original 100 ordered by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> have crashed and two months ago the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, concluded that the cost of planned improvements could be nearly $ 400 million for each bomber. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> cited problems with the aircraft's defense system and also troubles with fuel leaks. In a memorandum circulated to members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> procurement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> last week, committee chairman <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, D-Wis., questioned whether spending more money would solve the fleet's problems `` Even when these fixes are made, the plane will fall far short of the original electronic countermeasure specifications. We'll have to decide if improvement planned is worth the money,'' <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will review the request within the next two months as part of the defense authorization process. Rep. <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ireland </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Fla </LOCATION>., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the country has spent more than $ 20 billion on the fleet, and abandoning that investment would be difficult `` We do have 97 already invested. We need to finish them up again under close scrutiny,'' said <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Republican said the B-1 `` performs substantially as expected in a lot, a lot of ways,'' but an `` area of skepticism needs to prevail.'' In addition to the funding request for the B-1, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> also has proposed shifting nearly $ 300 million for procurement of the B-2 stealth bomber to research and development on the aircraft. `` We have to take a long, hard look at the B-2,'' said <PERSON> Leath </PERSON>. `` That thing is going to consume tons and tons of money, and I'm not sure at this point after going through the B-1 if we're up to that. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> has already proposed pushing back production of the B-2 to 1993, and almost $ 4.1 billion is being cut from the fiscal 1990 and 1991 budgets for the radar-evading plane. Recent estimates of $ 500 million per plane would make it the most expensive in history.

 City officials fed up with unruly Grateful Dead fans and drug use at weekend concerts said they will try to ban future appearances by the rock band. About 100 people were arrested during concerts Friday, Saturday and Sunday for various offenses, most involving drug possession, police said. `` All of the LSD and other drugs we confiscated was just incredible,'' said police Sgt. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>. Hundreds of fans turned up without tickets to see the sold-out concert Saturday. Police declared an emergency and called in reinforcements from other cities when about 100 fans tried to storm the <LOCATION> Irving </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Meadows </LOCATION> amphitheater, which seats about 15,000 people. Several officers were hit with flying objects, but no one was seriously hurt, Sgt. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> said. `` They were a mob out of control,'' said City Councilman <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosgrove </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> McNally </PERSON>, manager for the Grateful Dead, said Monday he saw no problems. `` The Grateful Dead is a large and sometimes rambunctious traveling circus, and we work hard to makes sure the things we do are in the spirit of good neighbors,'' <PERSON> McNally </PERSON> said. `` When it fails, we try to make it better.'' <PERSON> Cosgrove </PERSON> and Mayor <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Agran </PERSON> said they will investigate whether the city has the right to ban the band. The Grateful Dead has been recording since the 1960s and have inspired devotees, who call themselves dead heads, to follow the band across the country.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Japanese searchers combed waters off the southern island of <LOCATION> Kyushu </LOCATION> for two crewmen of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> submarine who were washed overboard Monday by a wave during predawn surface operations. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials said the diesel-powered <PERSON> Barbel </PERSON> was carrying out a routine mission earlier in the day when a wave crashed onto its desk, sweeping away three crewmen. They gave no details on what the operation involved. One of the crewmen, identified by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> as Lt. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Davenport </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, was rescued by the submarine soon afterward. Medical personnel on the submarine were treating him for mild hypothermia, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military spokesman Master Gunnery Sgt. <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodrigues </PERSON> said. The missing men were identified as fireman apprentice <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lear </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washburn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> and Lt. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> <PERSON> Womble </PERSON> II of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. The three crewmen were standing watch without life jackets because the seas looked relatively calm, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officers said. <PERSON> Kiyoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Harada </PERSON>, spokesman for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Maritime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said the accident occurred about 31 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Noma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Kagoshima </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prefecture </LOCATION>, or state. The area off <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s southernmost main island is about 650 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. Fog and high-wind alerts were in effect at the time of the accident, but the height of the waves and wind speed are not known, according to <PERSON> Yoshikazu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakamura </PERSON> of the local branch of the <ORGANIZATION> Maritime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Self-Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. The <PERSON> Barbel </PERSON> and another <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vessel joined several Japanese ships and airplanes in the search that went on into Monday night, officials of both countries said. A Japanese <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> official said the submarine had surfaced before the accident because it was taking on water from a hatch. He spoke on condition of anonymity and refused to elaborate. But a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman based in <LOCATION> Yokosuka </LOCATION> denied that report. `` We have no information that there is anything wrong with the Barbel,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Gradeck </PERSON>. However, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the submarine had some electrical problems after the wave that hit the men also washed into its conning tower, which is used as an entrance. The damage was quickly repaired, said Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Kudla </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. The Barbel, built in 1956, is equipped with six torpedo tubes and normally carries a crew of 77, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military officials said. The 219-foot-long, 2,145-ton vessel belongs to the last non-nuclear combat submarine class built by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 Afghan government commanders have issued Soviet-made gas masks to their troops in the besieged city of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, according to a telephone reports from guerrilla leader. Gen. <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wardak </PERSON>, military commander of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, conveyed the information by telephone from <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, on April 25 to <LOCATION> Marin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strmecki </LOCATION>, a Washington-based analyst who recently returned from <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>. `` He informed me by telephone that the Afghan government troops had been issued gas masks and other chemical warfare equipment, for example, protective suits and the launchers for chemical warfare shells,'' <PERSON> Strmecki </PERSON> said Monday. The troops, loyal to the Soviet-backed government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, have not used chemical weapons to break the siege, said <PERSON> Strmecki </PERSON>, an aide to former national security adviser <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Brzezinski </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Some reports have implied the failure of the attack against <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, involving an estimated 15,000 anti-communist <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas and a slightly smaller force loyal to the Soviet-backed government. The city, in eastern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, was viewed as a gateway to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. Another recent visitor to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnabel </PERSON>, assistant to Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said he saw Soviet-made gas masks during a trip to other parts of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> that ended last Dec. 13. `` I was going to bring some back, but I got tired of carrying them. These were a long way inside <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Schnabel </PERSON>. The congressional aide said he heard numerous reports of the use of chemical weapons, but found no eyewitnesses and did not believe government troops would use them to defend <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>. `` If your back is to the wall, you might do something like that. There appears to me to a stalemate. So it does n't appear to me that they would use it,'' he said. <PERSON> Strmecki </PERSON> did not depict the battle as a stalemate, and forecast a <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> victory. <PERSON> Wardak </PERSON> reported the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> `` are slowly and inexorably tightening a ring around <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>,'' and are within three miles of the city center, <PERSON> Strmecki </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Strmecki </PERSON> said he had visited the eastern and northern edges of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> on March 12, six days after <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> began their siege. Government forces, he said, were inflicting heavy casualties on the guerrillas with high altitude bombing runs by MiG-27 fighters and converted Antonov-12 transport planes operating above the range of U.S.-supplied Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, said <PERSON> Strmecki </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> airport has been closed since the siege began, and government resupply efforts have been confined to about 20 or 25 helicopter deliveries per day, he said.

 Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, now defending himself against <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics charges, in 1985 inserted in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' official journal his effusive endorsement of a home video program sold by a company employing his wife In the endorsement, later used by the company for promotional material, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> praised the program as `` a marvelously useful home video tool.'' Congressional rules generally bar members from receiving benefits as a result of improperly exerting their position, and guidelines caution lawmakers against becoming so `` affiliated with a particular enterprise'' that it creates an appearance of impropriety. The speaker, who is defending himself against charges that he broke <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules 69 times over the past decade, has argued recently that the career of his wife, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON>, is totally separate from his work as a member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. But in the Dec. 9, 1985 edition of the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Record </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> inserted a 350-word endorsement of the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>'s family video series that Mrs. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> had helped develop He did not mention her $ 36,000-a-year job at the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, company or role in its production. `` It was a nice gesture. We did n't ask for it,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitterer </PERSON>, the company's chief operating officer. `` We were pleasantly surprised.'' Asked Monday about the incident, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said he would have no comment. In the endorsement, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> calls the marketing of the video `` a heartening development indeed'' and notes that the series is `` available at a nominal price within the range of most American families.'' The tapes sold for $ 34.95 each. He also terms the taped motivational program `` a marvelously useful home video tool to promote togetherness and really productive family conversation.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> adds: `` From its base in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> has drawn upon the skills of professional educators and specialists in personal and family development to perfect a series of 21 home video programs ... The institute promises to make these services available widely throughout the country.'' The company later reprinted <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> Record comments as promotional material for its video series. Any member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is free to insert material into the Congressional Record, which is the daily journal of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' official floor activities But the rules generally bar any member from receiving benefits `` which would occur by virtue of influence improperly exerted from his position in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' The guidelines also caution lawmakers not to become `` too closely affiliated with a particular enterprise'' to prevent the appearance that the rule is being broken. They say further that `` communications should be drafted so that they do not lend themselves to misinterpretation as an official endorsement from the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' And the rules specifically bar members from letting their congressional stationery be used by outsiders for commercial promotions. In addition to charging <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> with 69 instances of House rules violations, the ethics panel is continuing to investigate a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> gas well deal that brought huge profits to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s blind trust in a short period last year. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s ties to the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> and his wife's employment are not currently subjects of the ethics probe. It is not known whether the committee was previously aware of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s submission of the promotional material to the Record, first reported Monday by the Wall Street Journal. But <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s employment by another company, the investment partnership she and her husband had with <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> real estate developer <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Marlene </PERSON>, is central to the ethics probe. The panel found reason to believe that $ 18,000-a-year job from 1981 through 1984 was nothing more than a conduit for gifts from <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> to the Wrights. Mrs. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s employment at the two companies overlapped for several months. She was hired by <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Tice </PERSON> in September 1984, and she worked for the company for $ 36,000 a year through 1987. During that time, <PERSON> Tice </PERSON> met numerous corporate executives and lobbyists through the Wrights, including at an appearance in 1985 at the annual retreat of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democrats to the <LOCATION> Greenbrier </LOCATION> resort in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> also ran one of <PERSON> Tice </PERSON>'s motivational seminars for <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s congressional staff during the time she worked for the company, according to people who attended the two-day session in a Capitol meeting room. <PERSON> Tice </PERSON>'s motivational message is based on the `` power of positive thinking'' model often used in sales. He encourages people to boost their own self-image, `` visualize'' their possibilities and screen out negative thoughts. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> himself is said by colleagues to be an strong adherent of <PERSON> Tice </PERSON>'s message. In a related development, five Texans subpoenaed to testify before the ethics panel on Wednesday about a gas drilling venture attacked the report of committee counsel <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> as misleading. In a report issued by their <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer, <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brand </ORGANIZATION>, the group argued that a geological formation struck by the well continues to be promising even though the well so far has been unable to produce commercial quantities of gas or oil. The report states that <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>, in characterizing the lucrative sale of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s share in the venture as a gift, has shown `` a fundamental misunderstanding of the oil business.'' The remaining partners in the venture plan to spend $ 2 million more to drill again because they estimate some $ 88 million in recoverable oil and gas is present in their leased tract near the <LOCATION> Louisiana-Texas </LOCATION> line. Brand said the group, which includes <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> financier <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON> and his son, M.D. <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON>, has not yet decided whether to honor the ethics committee's subpoena calling for them to testify on Wednesday and Thursday.

 <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said he expects his first official visit to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> on Tuesday to give <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace efforts a `` push forward.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> chairman said in an interview Monday he has `` great confidence'' in <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, the French president, as `` a man of principles and a supporter of the cause of justice.'' He criticized French Jewish leaders who have protested the visit and declared: `` I'm sure those who are interested in seeing peace prevail will change their minds and support the visit, which will certainly give further impetus to peace moves.'' Jewish groups have said they will mount protests during the two-day visit. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> will meet with <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, Premier <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON>. He will be accompanied by <PERSON> Farouk </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaddoumi </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> political department; <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Abed-Rabbo </PERSON>, the information director, and <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Milhem </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Darwish </PERSON>, members of the Executive Committee. <PERSON> Kaddoumi </PERSON> acts as the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> foreign minister and <PERSON> Abed-Rabbo </PERSON> has led the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> team in meetings with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> sources said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s media adviser, <PERSON> Bassam </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON>, and spokesman <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel-Rahman </PERSON> also would make the trip to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> ended its 13-year ban on dealings with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> in December and initiated a dialogue after <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> renounced terrorism and recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist. The changed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attitude and nearly 17 months of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> rebellion against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> have helped alter Western <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s perception of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. Several countries have begun direct contacts. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said in the interview, at his heavily guarded military headquarters in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>: `` I will discuss with President <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> everything ... including our peace initiatives. `` I will be ready to hear from him his ideas on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and the Palestinian issue in particular. I have great expectations that my visit to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and my meetings there will push forward the peace efforts in the region.'' In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, about 2,000 police were mobilized for the visit, authorities said. Sharpshooters were stationed on rooftops and helicopters patrolled overhead. Simultaneous demonstrations were planned for Tuesday evening, one by <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> supporters and the other by Jewish protesters. Premier <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> told journalists Sunday night the protocol would not equal that accorded a chief of state because <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> `` is neither a head of state nor a prime minister. He is being treated according to his level of dignity.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> ordered its outlets in 26 states Monday to restock Listerine pulled from shelves over the weekend after a woman said the mouthwash burned her mouth. Officials at <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Bentonville </LOCATION> began notifying managers of the chain's 1,279 stores to return thousands of bottles of the mouthwash to shelves after extensive testing by manufacturer <ORGANIZATION> Warner-Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Warner-Lambert </ORGANIZATION> rushed the unused portion of the suspect bottle through analysis Sunday night at its <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> laboratory, and conducted more tests early Monday The tests found only normal product ingredients. The mouthwash was removed from <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> shelves Saturday. `` We believed from the beginning this was an isolated incident. However, we chose not to take any chances,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Fields </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION>'s executive vice president for merchandising. `` The safety and well-being of our customers come first.'' Listerine was expected to be back on the shelves of all <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> stores by Monday night, said company spokesman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Shinkle </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> officials have not determined how much removing the mouthwash had cost the company, <PERSON> Shinkle </PERSON> said. He said no one was second-guessing the decision to do so. `` We stand by our decision and feel it was the thing to do,'' <PERSON> Shinkle </PERSON> said. `` Our customers would more than agree with that.'' The woman, whom company officials have declined to identify, complained Saturday that her mouth was red and irritated after using Listerine she bought at a <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Store </ORGANIZATION> in <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION>, Ark. She sought treatment from a dentist and `` is fine,'' <PERSON> Shinkle </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Warner-Lambert </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Morris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, said no other problems had been reported with Listerine, which is made at a plant in <LOCATION> Lititz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> `` It's a 125-year-old product. It's shipped around the country. If there's some problem with the product we would have received other calls, but we have n't,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. No ingredient in Listerine would cause burns, even when mixed in excessive amounts, <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said.

 The number of Palestinians killed by soldiers in April was the second highest monthly total of the long uprising in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, an Israeli human rights group said Monday. Also Monday, Palestinian sources said <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials abroad approve most orders to kill Arabs suspected of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The Israeli <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> in the Territories said soldiers killed 34 Palestinians in April, but the army disputed the figure. The organization said the monthly total was second only to 44 killed in April 1988. Doctors at <LOCATION> Mukassad </LOCATION> hospital in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> said 10-year-old <PERSON> Samir </PERSON> <PERSON> Merai </PERSON> died Monday of a wound suffered Wednesday in a confrontation with soldiers at the <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION> refugee camp in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. They said he was hit by a plastic bullet that penetrated his eye and lodged in his brain. The army said it was checking the report. <PERSON> Ahed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramini </PERSON>, a 30-year-old Palestinian was stabbed to death Monday as an alleged collaborator with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. A military spokesman confirmed <PERSON> Ramini </PERSON> was killed by masked youths in <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION> town and said the circumstances were being investigated. The army put the town under curfew, ordering all 30,000 residents to remain at home. <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Lulu </PERSON>, a 52-year-old Jewish settler arrested in connection with the shooting death of a 14-year-old Palestinian, was released on bail of about $ 13,880. Police said he still could be charged in the attack, which occurred Friday in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>. `` I clearly acted in self-defense,'' <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Lulu </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio after his release. Newspapers had quoted him earlier as saying he fired into the air. Palestinians and Israeli Arabs used May Day on Monday to demonstrate for an independent Palestinian state in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. About 2,000 people marched in <LOCATION> Nazareth </LOCATION>. Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse about 50 marchers in <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, slightly injuring three. Authorities said the demonstrators did not have a permit and 15 were arrested. Arab reports said soldiers wounded 15 Palestinians in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, including a 16-year-old boy with a serious chest wound. The army confirmed three people were wounded. The human rights center, founded by leftist parties and peace movements, said 33 of the Palestinian fatalities in April were caused by gunshot wounds and the 34th died of beating injuries inflicted by soldiers. An army spokesman said 28 Palestinians were killed and death tolls were higher in several other months. According to the human rights group, 423 Palestinians have been killed by army gunfire in the uprising. The army figure is 351. An <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> count shows 458 Palestinian deaths, including 41 people killed by other Palestinians as suspected collaborators. Eighteen Israelis also have died. <PERSON> Alon </PERSON> <PERSON> Liel </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said at least 10 alleged collaborators were killed in April, `` the bloodiest month from the point of view of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> attacks on Palestinians.'' `` It is n't a coincidence that it came in the month after -LRB- Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> suggested elections in the territories'' to chose Palestinians to negotiate an interim peace agreement, he said. <PERSON> Liel </PERSON> said he did not know if any of the victims supported <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s election plan. Palestinian sources say those slain by other Palestinians are killed for informing and other acts of collaboration, not for their political beliefs. Palestinian sources said local <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> activists conduct underground `` trials'' of Arabs suspected of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and then <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials abroad approve most orders to kill those found guilty. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> had no immediate comment on the report. The Palestinian sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the orders to kill the alleged collaborators were made by a Moslem clergyman believed to be based in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The sources said orders are relayed via coded messages broadcast by <ORGANIZATION> Baghdad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>. Israeli soldiers detained a former <ORGANIZATION> Jordanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> member, <PERSON> Farouq </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamdallah </PERSON>, for `` security reasons,'' said the army without elaborating. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said <PERSON> Hamdallah </PERSON> was detained after endorsing Palestinian attacks on Arab collaborators in a newspaper interview this week. <PERSON> Hamdallah </PERSON>, of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Anabta </LOCATION>, was one of 30 Palestinians who represented the territory in the Jordanian legislature from 1984 to 1988.

 An <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> sailor who vanished from a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> base in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION> nine months ago and was feared dead turned up alive Monday, hours after her photograph appeared on television, Italian authorities said. A highway patrolman saw <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Muir </PERSON>, a 22-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> petty officer third class, on a roadside outside <LOCATION> Villa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Giovanni </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Calabria </LOCATION> at about 4 a.m. and recognized her, said police Col. <PERSON> Antonino </PERSON> <PERSON> Di </PERSON> <PERSON> Vincenzo </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION> news agency said another patrolman also saw the show about missing persons broadcast Sunday night by RAI-TV. On it, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Muir </PERSON>'s father <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> engineer from <LOCATION> Trumbull </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, appealed for help in finding her. She vanished July 29 from a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military base in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> police originally suspected foul play. Di <PERSON> Vincenzo </PERSON> said Monday from police headquarters in <LOCATION> Reggio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Calabria </LOCATION>: `` She's fine and has been reunited with her father.'' He said Miss <PERSON> Muir </PERSON> apparently had been living with a man in <LOCATION> Villa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Giovanni </LOCATION>, in the toe of the Italian boot. Police brought her to <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION> on Monday evening for questioning by a magistrate before being turned over to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military authorities, <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION> said. Lt. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Weishaupt </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>, said earlier that Italian authorities informed the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> they had an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> woman in custody who identified herself as <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Muir </PERSON>. Miss <PERSON> Muir </PERSON> had been assigned to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sealift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>. In October, an Italian magistrate named an American seaman as being suspected of murder and concealing a body.

 Police on Monday charged a 22-year-old civil servant with murder in a shooting spree that killed one man and wounded 14 people in a coastal town. Lawmakers called for tightening <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s already strict gun control laws following the 15-minute shotgun rampage Sunday afternoon. Police arrested <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sartin </PERSON>, 22, shortly after the attack in <LOCATION> Monkseaton </LOCATION>, a fashionable suburb of the <LOCATION> Whitley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> seaside resort in northeast <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. Dressed in black and wearing sunglasses and an ammunition belt, the gunman walked the streets shooting indiscriminately, witnesses said. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Mackintosh </PERSON>, 41, married and the father of two children, was killed. Four of the 14 wounded remained hospitalized Monday, three in serious condition. On Monday, police granted the suspect a five-minute visit with his parents, then announced his identity and said he was charged with the slaying of <PERSON> Mackintosh </PERSON>. Detective Superintendent <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> told reporters <PERSON> Sartin </PERSON> probably will be charged with other offenses later. A neighbor of <PERSON> Sartin </PERSON> said she was `` absolutely stunned'' to hear of the young man's arrest. The woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said `` he was always a nice boy. ... He has never given any trouble here.'' Police said the shotgun found in his car during his arrest was licensed to his father. Home Secretary <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON>, the Cabinet minister responsible for law and order, asked for a police report into the shootings. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s gun laws were tightened following the country's worst mass murder in August 1987. Gun collector <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> ran through <LOCATION> Hungerford </LOCATION>, 60 miles west of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, killing 16 people, including his mother, before turning his gun on himself. The new laws banned sawed-off shotguns, mortars and self-loading rifles, a high-powered weapon similar to that used by <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>. Britons were already prohibited from owning such automatic weapons as machine guns and must obtain a license to own other weapons. Applicants for gun licenses must satisfy police they have a good reason to own each firearm and its ammunition, a suitable place to use them and can store them securely to prevent theft. But police and lawmakers said Monday that too many loopholes remain in the law. `` It's far too easy for people to get ahold of shotguns,'' said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, which represents more than 120,000 police officers. Lawmaker <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Winnick </PERSON> of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said the government should make it more difficult for individuals to obtain a license to own a shotgun. His colleague, <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Leadbitter </PERSON>, called for a ban on individuals owning any firearms for private use. However, <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Beaumont-Dark </PERSON>, member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> for the governing <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, cautioned against a `` knee-jerk reaction.'' The British <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shooting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> said tighter laws were not the answer. `` There are nearly a million legitimate shotgun holders in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>,'' said director <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Swift </PERSON>. `` One man dressed in black leather with a knife strapped to his thigh has nothing to do with those ordinary men and women who take part in country shooting.''

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> averted a potentially serious rift in U.S.-Japanese relations by going ahead with the controversial agreement for the two countries to develop jointly a new jet fighter for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the new American ambassador to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> said Monday. Ambassador <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> told reporters that despite persistent, strong objections to the project on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, `` I'm confident it will meet with the acquiescence of our <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced Friday that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> intends to proceed with the FSX fighter program because it is `` in the strategic and commercial interests of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' After taking office in January, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ordered a review of the $ 7 billion project negotiated under his predecessor, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Critics in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> have said it amounts to a giveaway of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> high technology and have said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> should make an `` off-the-shelf'' aircraft purchase, as do other nations that are <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> customers. <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> brought up the negative side of scrapping the agreement in an appearance at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Foreign Press Center on the eve of his departure for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, where he is due next week. Proceeding with the FSX project `` is important from our standpoint because of what it avoided, namely -LRB- <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> -RRB- going down separate tracks,'' he said. `` It avoids what could have been an important breach in our relationship if this deal had gone awry.'' The FSX agreement `` is a good arrangement for both our governments. We have had coproduction in past, but major codevelopment is in a sense the first'' such arrangement with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON>, a former undersecretary of state for political affairs. `` I hope this will be a model of the flow of two-way technology which is quite appropriate to a more mature relationship between our countries in this field,'' the ambassador said. The White House said Monday that, with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` has been very tough in demanding equity for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in terms of its commercial interests,'' and he `` was successful in getting everything he asked for.'' Friday's announcement said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies would be guaranteed about 40 percent of the production work on the planned 130 new fighters while certain computer codes from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> F-16 jet, which provides the model for the FSX, would be withheld.

 <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON>, the powerful political activist whose support was courted by candidates ranging from condominum board members to a president, died Monday after an eight-year battle with cancer. She was 75. Ms. <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> died in her sleep at her condominium early Monday, said her daughter, <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleisher </PERSON> of Plantation. Her political friends included President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, fellow Democrats <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, and nearly every well-known Democratic politician in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> successfully roused retirees from political apathy and mobilized them into powerful voting blocs. Famed for turnouts ranging past 90 percent, they were dubbed `` condo commandos.'' `` She articulated the values and aspirations of tens of thousands of people who moved to northeast <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> for their retirement,'' said state Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, a Democrat and a strategist for national and statewide political candidates. `` She kind of embodied their continued interest in the community they live in,'' <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said. `` It would have been so easy for all these people to come to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and just retire. Instead, they became a force of leadership.''

<HEAD>Eight Youths On Hunger Strike in Soviet Georgia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Eight men from <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> were holding a hunger strike in a <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> hospital and demanding an antidote to gas used by soldiers to quell a nationalist demonstration, a Georgian activist said Monday. The men, ranging in age from 19 to 26, have been fasting since Friday, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Nadiradze </PERSON>, a member of a Georgian pro-independence group. He said they also are demanding an inspection by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Nadiradze </PERSON> said in a telephone interview that the strike aimed to `` defend the poisoned people,'' referring to the dozens of <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> residents still hospitalized with symptoms that Georgian health officials say resemble the effects of nerve gas. At least 20 people died and 1,100 were injured in ethnic unrest in <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, on April 9. <LOCATION> Georgian </LOCATION> activists say the soldiers attacked a peaceful demonstration with shovels, clubs and chemicals. Soviet officials have acknowledged tear gas was used on some protesters, but they deny nerve gas or other lethal chemical weapons were turned on the demonstrators. Members of a citizen's commission investigating the confrontation and doctors treating victims say a second gas that paralyzes the central nervous system was used. <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief, <PERSON> Givi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gumbaridze </PERSON>, said some victims died of gas poisoning. The southern republic's minister of internal affairs, <PERSON> Shota </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorgodze </PERSON>, on Monday denied a military officer's claim that soldiers and their families have been beaten and their apartments stoned because citizens blame them for the April 9 confrontation. Pravda quoted <PERSON> Gorgodze </PERSON> as saying that his ministry had received eight reports of attacks against soldiers, and all turned out to be false. He said no official complaints had come in of attacks against families, and rumors to that effect proved wrong. Gen. I.N. <PERSON> Rodionov </PERSON>, commander of the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> military district, said Saturday that people in <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> are blaming <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> soldiers for the clash and taking revenge on their families. He pointed out the troops involved belonged to the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and suggested they should wear special uniforms that would help identify them. Demonstrations in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> first began April 4 when protesters criticized calls from members of the republic's ethnic Abkhazian minority to break away because of alleged discrimination by Georgians. Other protesters have demanded <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> secede from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> because of alleged interference from the central government.

 Expansion of private and public health insurance to the nation's 37 million uninsured is ill-advised because it does n't target people who need help most and does n't curtail spiraling health care costs, a former health adviser to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Monday The testimony from <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Steelman </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer and formerly chief health adviser to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, came as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> and Human Resources opened hearings on the measure introduced by the panel's chairman, Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., and Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, D-Calif While <PERSON> Steelman </PERSON> now has no formal ties with the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, she is widely regarded as an expert on health financing issues and the criticism she laid out of the <PERSON> Kennedy-Waxman </PERSON> bill amounted to a blueprint of the strong opposition to the legislation that is likely to produce protracted debate. `` This bill offers no proposals to counteract a dangerous trend: Over the last 15 years, health-care expenditures in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have risen at an average annual rate of 12 percent,'' she said. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> has acknowledged that his bill does not try to get at the larger issue of across-the-board health cost control, but says that should n't be used as a reason to oppose it. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and other proponents maintain it would be unfair to wait until broad-based programs to control costs are developed before extending health care to the uninsured. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Democrat has acknowledged that his bill probably would cost an additional $ 12 billion a year when fully phased in about 10 years, but argues that costs should not stand in the way of a nation taking care of its ill and injured. <PERSON> Steelman </PERSON>, however, predicted `` there will be great fanfare over minor increases totaling less than $ 500 million nationwide'' and questioned where the support would come for such massive expenditures as envisioned by the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> bill. `` We have not seen any domestic program increases of this since at either the state or federal level, since the early 70's,'' she said. She said there are variety of ways to deal with the problem of the medically insured, but argued that <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s bill tries to do too much through a government program. `` Obviously, the proper role of government and the first priority of a program for the uninsured must be to cover low-income individuals through a carefully targeted improved and expanded Medicaid program,'' she said. The bill was supported by a panel of four individuals who recounted their difficulties in paying medical bills on low salaries and by representatives of th <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospitals </ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diabetes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>.

 Native and civil rights groups demand the state police minister resign because of a manhunt for an aborigine suspect in which an innocent man was fatally shot and officers staged a fake arrest. An aboriginal activist group even put up posters Monday saying the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> police minister, <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON>, should be shot. The way police conducted their search for a <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>, suspected of wounding two officers in <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION> a week ago, has angered the state ombudsman and political opposition as well as aboriginal and civil rights organizations. Aborigines, already chafing at the slow pace of a government inquiry into more than 100 black deaths in police custody, accused authorities of conducting a witch hunt in the search for <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>. Aboriginal activists claim most of the deaths since 1980 have been due to police brutality. Police Commissioner <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Avery </PERSON> urged the suspect to surrender to avert further bloodshed. He said investigating officers were `` abundantly aware that every move they make will come under microscopic scrutiny.'' `` I do n't want the suspect to feel too harried or pursued or he's going to react violently, and that means more lives will be lost,'' <PERSON> Avery </PERSON> said. `` What we want is to resolve this peacefully without any more people being killed.'' <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>'s family said he should not surrender. <PERSON> Jenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Davies </PERSON>, 28, common-law wife of the suspect's brother, said: `` If he showed his face, police would shoot him dead. They would n't give him a chance. They would shoot him on sight for sure. One innocent man has already been shot dead by police over this.'' Police say <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> emptied an automatic pistol at two policemen who thought he was trying to steal a car in <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION> a week ago, then eluded pursuit in the city and is being hunted on a national scale. One of the policemen, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> McQueen </PERSON>, 26, was in critical condition Monday after surgeons removed a lung, a kidney and part of his liver. The other wounded man, 19-year <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON>, was discharged after treatment for a stomach wound. When the hunt began in earnest, `` it was a bad week in <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION> for colored men with dreadlock hair,'' the Morning Herald said. Blacks with Rastafarian hairstyles complained of police harassment. Officers rounded up dozens of people for questioning, in one case stopping a car carrying three men from <LOCATION> Tonga </LOCATION>. One was found to be in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> illegally and was deported. On Thursday, police stormed the home of <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Gundy </PERSON> and fatally shot the unarmed aborigine. Police initially said <PERSON> Gundy </PERSON>, who was in bed, lunged at them and went for a gun, but then contradicted the original statement. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, a neighbor, said he overheard a detective saying: `` I was sure it was him -LRB- <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> -RRB-. He was around the same size.'' Another neighbor, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, was awakened by the sound of police kicking in <PERSON> Gundy </PERSON>'s door. That same day, police raided six houses in <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brisbane </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Queensland </LOCATION> state. They fired five stun grenades into the empty home of <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>'s brother and faked an arrest that was filmed for the evening television news, then told the media it was a hoax. The <PERSON> Gundy </PERSON> shooting brought calls for <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON>'s resignation and demands for a <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inquiry </ORGANIZATION>, the highest investigation available, into police conduct. On Monday, an aboriginal group calling itself the Coalition Against Legalized Murder, or CALM, distributed posters in <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION> that showed <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON>'s head framed in a gunsight and said someone should `` upgrade'' Premier <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiner </PERSON>'s government `` with a bullet.'' <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> said he was considering legal action.

<TEXT>
 Syrian forces pounded the coast north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Monday after a night of tank and mortar battles with Christian army units outside the city despite a three-day truce. Druse warlord <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON> demanded Christians topple their Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> as a condition for peace, and <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> charged the Syrian-Druse alliance broke the cease-fire organized Friday by the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. Police said two Lebanese soldiers were killed and seven civilians wounded in overnight fighting around the Christian garrison town of <LOCATION> Souk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> el-Gharb </LOCATION> _ the first casualties since Friday. <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>'s spokesman announced in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, that Christian shells Monday killed one of their militiamen and wounded two. This brings the toll to 276 people killed and 1,002 wounded since March 8, when fighting erupted. Rocket-propelled grenades and anti-aircraft fire crackled Monday across the abandoned commercial district straddling <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s port. `` This ominous escalation ... threatens plans by the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> to dispatch a pan-Arab observer force to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to monitor the truce,'' said a police spokesman who can not be identified under regulations. Despite the fighting, neither side appears to consider the truce irretrievable. <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> radio stations said <PERSON> Lakhdar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahimi </PERSON>, the Algerian envoy of <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Chedli </PERSON> <PERSON> Klibi </PERSON>, was due in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> within 24 hours to finalize deployment of the multinational <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> observer force. The police spokesman said at least 45 shells and rockets exploded on a 10-mile strip of beach between <LOCATION> Byblos </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION> ports, paralyzing shipping activity. An <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> spokesman said his units `` fired back in self-defense'' in <LOCATION> Souk </LOCATION> el-Gharb and <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> port, but did not respond to shelling of the Christian coastline. Souk el-Gharb sits atop a strategic network of mountain roads. If it falls, the Moslems will be poised to flush out the Christians from mountain strongholds protecting their 310-square-mile enclave. Syrian army troops and the Druse militia outnumber <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s mainly Christian army by 3-1. <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON> issued a May Day statement saying: `` It's impossible to reach a compromise with <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. He must be removed or toppled.'' <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who also heads the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s dual government, has refused to call off the blockade of three illegal harbors run by Moslem militias, which triggered the fighting. Although the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire plan provides for lifting air, sea and land blockades, <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> contends his gunboats and helicopter gunships are `` applying Lebanese laws.'' The rival Moslem Cabinet under Acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> has insisted raising the blockade `` is an integral part of the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>'s peace plan. Without it there will be no cease-fire.'' <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> imposed the blockade in a bid to restore state authority and recoup lost annual taxes of $ 100 million. The rival Cabinets emerged in September after outgoing President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> was unable to elect a new leader. The <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> navy tanker <PERSON> Penhors </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> waters Monday with 15,000 tons of fuel from the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> to boost rationed electricty in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The rival Cabinets said the tanker will unload 75 percent of the shipment in the Christian port of <LOCATION> Zouk </LOCATION> and the rest in the Moslem oil terminal of <PERSON> Zahrani </PERSON>. Christian radio stations later said the Syrian bombardment prevented the Penhors from approaching Zouk. Police and the French Embassy withheld comment. But <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, who had pledged to the 12-nation trade bloc that no shelling would occur when the Penhors approached, apologized. `` I feel bound to extend my apology to the European Community for being unable to honor my obligations due to surprise developments that caused a delay in the unloading operation,'' he said in a statement.

<HEAD>FDA Panel Recommends Approval of AIDS Drug</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> advisory committee on Monday recommended approval of an aerosolized version of a drug that helps prevent a life-threatening pneumonia in AIDS patients. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> is expected to follow the recommendation and approve an aerosol version of pentamidine within weeks, said an <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> source who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Aerosolized pentamidine has been widely available to AIDS patients since the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> in February allowed its distribution to be expanded as an experimental medication under government review. However, many insurance plans do not cover experimental drugs. <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> approval would allow nearly universal reimbursement for AIDS patients using the drug. The advisory committee recommended approval of aerosolized pentamidine for preventing initial and recurring bouts of pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, which causes an estimated 60 percent of AIDS deaths. Pentamidine was approved five years ago for use as an injectable drug to treat those already suffering from pneumocycstis. The spray version would make it easier to take into the lungs where the pneumonia infection first shows up. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> estimated that 50,000 patients with AIDS could benefit from the treatment. The recommendation was based largely on data collected from a recent clinical trial conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consortium </ORGANIZATION>, a group of physicians who treat AIDS patients. The trial, which compared the safety of different doses of aerosolized pentamidine, found that the drug `` did not provide complete protection, but did significantly reduce the incidence of this pneumonia,'' the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> LyphoMed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Rosemont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, the leading supplier of injectable pentamidine, is asking to be licensed to supply the aerosol version.

<HEAD>Prisoners Riot to Protest Jail Conditions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARRINGTON, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prisoners rampaged through two cell wings of a jail Monday, and dozens conducted a rooftop protest of living conditions, prison officers reported. The <PERSON> Risley </PERSON> remand center, designed to hold just over 500 men in single cells, now accommodates 600 men and 140 women awaiting trial. It is near <LOCATION> Warrington </LOCATION>, 10 miles east of <LOCATION> Liverpool </LOCATION> on the northwest coast. Trouble began Sunday night when 17 prisoners tried to overpower guards who were unlocking cells in B wing for an exercise period, authorities said. Scores of men wrecked furniture and water pipes. A similar incident began in D wing Monday when it was announced that visits would be canceled because of the violence, officials said. They said B wing was under control Monday night but up to 40 inmates remained on the roof of D wing. Several who hurled objects from the roof at prison officers wore hoods to hide their faces. Three cell areas were wrecked and both wings were flooded by water from the broken pipes, said <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, chairman of the <PERSON> Risley </PERSON> branch of the Prison Officers' Association. Four guards suffered minor injuries to fingers or ribs but no prisoners were injured, he said. Two guards locked themselves in a second-floor cell when the prisoners broke out, their colleagues said. Rioters tried to enter the cell to get at the men, but other officers rescued them by breaking through an outside wall with sledgehammers, they said. Banners on the roof repeated common complaints about conditions in the jail. A report last year by the Inspector of Prisons described conditions at <PERSON> Risley </PERSON> as `` squalid and barbarous.'' The investigation was conducted after seven suicides were reported at the jail in 18 months. Several prisoner protests, including rooftop demonstrations, have occurred since. <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said 250 inmates were moved from <PERSON> Risley </PERSON> to nearby jails Monday because their cells were smashed. `` Most of those who have been moved out have not been involved in the trouble, but we had to move them because they had nowhere to sleep,'' he said.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> called Monday on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> to ensure next Sunday's elections are fair by blocking what he said are Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s efforts to rig the balloting through `` massive fraud. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> issued the unusual appeal in a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> speech but left unclear the precise steps he believes the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> should take in defiance of their commander. Spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said later that <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> feels all institutions in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, including the Defense Forces, should do what is necessary to promote an honest outcome next Sunday. Speaking to the Council of the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION>, a business group, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the military forces are the key to a free election. `` They can fulfill their constitutional duty as professional soldiers and allow the elections to proceed freely and fairly. Or they can face the consequences of the path on which Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has placed them,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. Asked for elaboration, Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> was merely pointing out that all of the people and institutions in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, including the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, `` are paying a price because of the isolation and economic crisis'' resulting from <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s rule. Meanwhile, four <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senators, two from each party, wound up a visit to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and predicted that `` we are about to see a totally fraudulent election.'' In a statement, they said they had learned <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s government will be the only organization permitted to count the votes, that the <ORGANIZATION> Panamanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> which he commands will be responsible for safeguarding the ballots, that no exit polling will be permitted and that following the government tally, all ballots will be burned. In a letter, the senators urged the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> to demand that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> permit the election to be `` free, fair and open'' and said they were concerned that the continuation of undemocratic government in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> `` would also likely result in a situation dangerous for hemispheric peace.'' Signing the letter were Sens. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Fla </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>.; and <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Robb </PERSON>, D-Va. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s comments were part of a stepped-up administration effort to call attention to what officials believe is an effort by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to stay in power through manipulation of voter lists The administration hopes to weaken <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as much as possible by discrediting the election process in advance. The principal contest Sunday matches <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Duque </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> ally who is the presidential nominee of a coalition of pro-government parties, against an opposition slate headed by <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>. Free elections could usher in a new era for financially strapped <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said, but he contended <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is preparing for a `` massive fraud and to restrict the presence of international observers and press.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> reaffirmed the longstanding <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position that there will be no accommodation with a Noriega-dominated government. With the help of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, he said, there is still time for the Panamanians to save their country from the `` increasing destruction wrought by the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> dictatorship.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s remarks followed by three days Panamanian charges in the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has interfered in the election by supplying millions of dollars to opposition candidates and by sending commandos, special weapons and helicopters to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> also warned the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> not to become ideologically or militarily involved in Central America. `` Together with the other democracies, we must send a clear message to others outside this hemisphere: This is not a dumping ground for their arms or their failed ideologies.'' He said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> now has an opportunity `` to demonstrate its so-called new thinking and to demonstrate it in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.''

<BYLINE>New Jersey Students Ask U.N.: Is A Nickel Too Much to Save the
Earth? ^By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 A paper lunch tray might cost 5 cents more than a plastic model that harms the environment, but students who rid their schools of plastic trays said Monday it was worth a nickel to help save the Earth. Several <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Milford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> students told of their successful anti-plastics battle at <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters. They appeared before hundreds of students at a daylong forum sponsored by the U.N. Environment Program. `` Our battle cry was, ` Put your money where your mouth is,''' said 15-year-old <PERSON> Tanja </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogt </PERSON>, who launched the campaign. A majority of the students at <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Milford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Macopin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> agreed with her and paid an extra nickel for their cafeteria lunches to be served on cardboard trays. The campaign against polystyrene products began when the teen-ager, inspired by <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Paine </PERSON>'s revolutionary pamphlet `` Common Sense,'' wrote a civics paper calling for their ban. Environmentalists say the products, unlike paper, take many years to break down. `` In October, I read an article in our local paper that stated despite threats to all life, the -LRB- school -RRB- board continues to use polystyrene trays in the school cafeteria,'' she said. `` The reason given was pure economics. Paper trays cost 5 cents more than polystyrene. `` I was disgusted. I knew the environment was worth an extra nickel, and I was very confident that my peers would agree,'' she said. For one week last autumn, the schools gave the students a choice: pay $ 1.20 for lunch on plastic, or $ 1.25 for a meal on a paper tray. Seventy-two percent of the high school students and 86 percent of the middle school students paid the extra nickel for paper trays. The <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> voted in December to stop purchasing polystyrene for the township's schools, effective Feb. 1. The students have launched a letter-writing campaign to persuade every school in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> to abolish the use of foam plastics. <PERSON> Kurtiz </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneid </PERSON>, 16, said the success of the anti-plastics campaign led to formation of a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Milford </LOCATION> ecology club and to new initiatives. `` I personally visited our local McDonald's dressed as <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> McToxic </PERSON> to emphasize our opposition to foam packaging,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 A leading Soviet dissident, dismissing <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s reform campaign as a one-sided attempt to save a failed system, predicted on Monday that President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policies will lead to `` a terrible clash ... bloodshed of huge proportions. But turmoil inside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> could lead <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to release its grip on such eastern European nations as <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bukovsky </PERSON> told a forum of democratic leaders from around the world. <PERSON> Bukovsky </PERSON>, who was jailed and sentenced to internal exile in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, then released in 1976 after an international campaign on his behalf, now heads the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> in the U.S.S.R, a New York-based human rights group. He spoke before the annual conference of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, which brought to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> advocates of democracy from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to present report cards on what many of the speakers called `` a universal democratic revolution.'' The endowment is a U.S.-financed, private-sector attempt to foster democracy as an alternative to totalitarian and authoritarian regimes. Speaking at the forum in the meeting room of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bukovsky </PERSON> contended that in spite of the widespread impression that genuine reform is taking place in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, `` the politburo has not moved toward democracy.'' `` Perestroika is no attempt to establish a free market economy,'' <PERSON> Bukovsky </PERSON> said. `` Glasnost does not mean the same as freedom of speech.'' `` This is an attempt to square a circle, to find a form of socialism that can survive,'' he said. `` But you can not square a circle.'' <PERSON> Bukovsky </PERSON> predicted `` a terrible clash in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> between the people and the government, bloodshed of huge proportions.'' He said the process has already started with the bloody suppression of demonstrations in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and the arrest of nationalists in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. Citing what he said are other signs of a crackdown, <PERSON> Bukovsky </PERSON> added: `` The good news is that when there is turmoil in the Soviet system, some countries like <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> may have a chance to get out.'' He said the West is confused about <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his aims and mistakenly wants to help him with economic credits. Instead, he said, the West should be supporting the democratic opposition inside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> because `` the more cohesive and organized the opposition is, the less likely the government is to repress it.'' But Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, D-Calif., said it is clear to him there is a `` new element'' in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> leadership, which is `` prepared to make major compromises. `` We've got to deal with them,'' <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> said. `` We are trying to urge them to establish a social compact with all elements of their own society.'' But <PERSON> Bukovsky </PERSON> replied the West is `` doing nothing'' to help the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s democratic forces. He asserted that billions of dollars of economic credits, mostly from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, are flowing into the Kremlin's coffers. `` This will prop up the Soviet regime and help them not to reform,'' he said. He suggested that the West allocate 10 percent of any credits given to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to democratic forces there.

<HEAD>No Right To Lawyer Before Breath Test In Massachusetts, Court Rules</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A motorist suspected of drunken driving has no constitutional right to an attorney before deciding whether to take a breath test, the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled Monday. In a decision overturning a <LOCATION> Worcester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> judge, the high court said it could find nothing in the federal or state constitutions compelling `` the conclusion that a defendant has the right to counsel before deciding whether to submit to a Breathalyzer test.'' In a unanimous opinion, the high court said `` the moment at which a person must decide to take or to refuse to take a Breathalyzer test is not a critical stage in the criminal process.'' Refusal to take the test results in suspension of a driver's license for 120 days The decision stemmed from an appeal by the <LOCATION> Worcester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> district attorney's office in central <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> in a case involving <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brazelton </PERSON>, a Worcester-area resident arrested in 1987 for operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol. <PERSON> Brazelton </PERSON> was taken to the <LOCATION> Worcester </LOCATION> police station and booked, and was advised of his Miranda rights and his right to take a breath test or blood alcohol test. When an officer told <PERSON> Brazelton </PERSON> he could n't call his attorney until after he had decided whether to take the breath test, <PERSON> Brazelton </PERSON> refused the examination. District Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> dismissed the charges against <PERSON> Brazelton </PERSON> on grounds that he should have been allowed to call his attorney first, saying `` it would not have caused an unreasonable delay in the administration'' of the test. But the high court, in voiding <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s order and remanding <PERSON> Brazelton </PERSON>'s case to trial, said `` formidable practical problems'' could arise if the lower court's ruling stood. For instance, the justices said, `` If an attorney is not available, a delay may ensue and the test results may then be stale and inaccurate.'' <PERSON> Brazelton </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Travers </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, said that because courts in other states have been divided on the question, `` at least on 14th Amendment -LRB- due process -RRB- grounds, it may be a proper issue for determination by the -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>.'' It was the first time the high court had been asked to decide on the right to counsel before a breath test. Some courts in other states, such as <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, have found the right to counsel on breath tests in their state laws, state constitutions or the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Constitution.

 Archbishop <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Eames </PERSON>, the Anglican primate of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, made a special appeal Monday for the release of an Irishman and 14 other foreigners held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Eames </PERSON> is among 27 Anglican church leaders attending a weeklong conference in this Mediterranean tourist resort about 110 miles from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` May I appeal to anyone who has control of <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> to release him. To do so would win respect from the world outside,'' <PERSON> Eames </PERSON> said in a written appeal. <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON>, 38, from <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, an English-language teacher at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION>, disappeared while walking to work on April 11, 1986. No organization claimed his abduction, but he is believed held by pro-Iranian Moslem fundamentalists in Moslem-controlled west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> where 14 other foreigners are also held. The other hostages are nine Americans, three Britons _ including Anglican special envoy <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> _ an Italian and a Belgian. American <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, was seized on March 16, 1985, and is the longest held hostage. <PERSON> Eames </PERSON> said that `` as a churchman from <PERSON> Brian </PERSON>'s home country I have joined with the other Anglican primates in urging the release of all hostages. `` I write these words in the earnest hope that they may be read by someone who is in contact with <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> at this time ... In God's name and in the name of justice and peace I appeal for his release. The archbishops represent 70 million Anglicans worldwide. Such meetings are held every three years.

 Police broke up anti-government protests Monday at an official May Day parade in the capital, punching some people and detaining at least 76, unofficial sources said. At least two people were reported injured. Several prominent dissidents, including <PERSON> Stanislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Devaty </PERSON> of the independent Charter 77 movement, and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> journalist <PERSON> Misha </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenny </PERSON> were among those detained, the sources said. <PERSON> Devaty </PERSON> was recently freed from jail after a hunger strike. Protests broke out at the start and close of a 90-minute parade opened by <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON>. At least 600 people shouted demands for more freedom and the release of people they view as political prisoners, including playwright <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>. At the beginning of the parade for the day to honor labor, about 100 people unfurled banners supporting Charter 77. `` Let Us Live!'' they yelled when police called for them to disperse. When told their demonstration was illegal, they shouted back, `` Long Live the First of May!'' and shouted, `` This is dialogue?'' Officials have been holding dialogues with young people since last January, when police used force to end a week of protests. Police detained at least 76 people in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> during Monday's protests, activist <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabatova </PERSON> said She said 18 other people were detained in the city of <LOCATION> Brno </LOCATION>, but she gave no details. Most of those detained were released by early evening. <PERSON> Glenny </PERSON>, central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> correspondent for the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said he was punched once in the face after uniformed police detained him. He said authorities also smashed his tape reporder on the ground and took his cassette. He was held for five hours and released after being fined $ 10 for not carrying identification papers. Newly arrived at his post, he was not due to receive official accreditation until Tuesday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said it would protest to <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> about his arrest and treatment. <PERSON> Glenny </PERSON> said he was taken to a nearby police station with about 20 other people. He said one of them, peace activist <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Tvaroch </PERSON>, suffered a concussion when police grabbed him and punched him in the head and back. The bulk of the protesters eventually dispersed when hundreds of security forces marched toward them. While embracing economic reform, <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> and the other Communist leaders have not endorsed political changes promoted by President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. This country's current leadership was installed after the Soviets led a <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> invasion to crush party reforms in 1968. <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> reiterated in his speech opening Monday's rally that authorities in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> would not allow `` unrest and tension in society'' or anti-Communist projects under the guise of reform.

 Claims for a record $ 115.5 million lottery jackpot were filed Monday by three more potential winners, including a woman who did n't want any publicity because she feared the reaction in her drug-infested neighborhood. All three are women from <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>: Blanche Downing, 55; <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>, a housewife; and <PERSON> Angeline </PERSON> <PERSON> Pavloski </PERSON>, a 69-year-old retired waitress who plans to split her prize with her brother, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLorenzo </PERSON>. Ms. Downing told lottery officials her neighborhood `` has lots of cocaine activity'' and she fears for her safety now that she has apparently won a <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Super 7 lottery prize worth $ 8.3 million, to be distributed over the next 26 years. She was accompanied by a former <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> policeman and two other friends. They quickly walked out of lottery headquarters after filing the claim, trying to duck photographers, and climbed into a car. She declined to answer reporters' questions. Lottery spokeswoman <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said the lottery suggested Ms. Downing not return to her neighborhood. `` We realize the position she's in,'' Ms. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said. In order to claim her winnings, Ms. Downing had to agree to allow her name to be used. If tickets held by her and the other claimaints prove to be winners, the first checks will be issued next week, Ms. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said. The ticket validation process, which started Monday for all 11 of 14 winning tickets presented so far, will be completed sometime this week, the spokeswoman said. Each annual payment will be $ 317,524.67, before taxes. Ms. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said lottery officials took a call from a woman in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> who said she had the winning numbers, but would n't file a claim until later in the week. Winners have a year from the date of the drawing to file a claim. Asked why she waited until Monday to file her claim, Mrs. <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said: `` We just had other things to do.'' Neither Mrs. <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>, who refused to give her age, nor Mrs. <PERSON> Pavloski </PERSON> said they had any plans for the money. Mrs. <PERSON> Pavloski </PERSON> was sick last week and did n't check her tickets until Friday, three days after the winning numbers were drawn. She said she has played the lottery since its introduction in 1972. `` I always said to myself one of these days I'm going to hit real good. And I never knew I was going to hit this big,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Pavloski </PERSON> said. The $ 115.5 million jackpot was a North American record. The previous record was $ 69.9 million in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, split by four winning tickets April 15.

<HEAD>Airlift Taking Tens of Thousands of Expatriates Home</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DAKAR, Senegal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thousands of expatriate Senegalese and Mauritanians flew to their homelands Monday in an airlift aimed at ending a wave of violence that has left hundreds dead. About 55 Mauritanians were reported killed Friday and Saturday in <LOCATION> Dakar </LOCATION> and the provinces by angry Senegalese seeking revenge for the deaths of hundreds of their countrymen in neighboring <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION> earlier last week. Unconfirmed reports said as many as 400 Senegalese were killed April 24-25 in <LOCATION> Nouakchott </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION>'s capital, in a wave of violence that began over a land dispute. <LOCATION> Nouakchott </LOCATION> is 375 miles north of <LOCATION> Dakar </LOCATION>. States of emergency and curfews were in effect in both West African nations' capitals, but vandalism continued in <LOCATION> Dakar </LOCATION>. The French news agency Agence France-Presse reported bands of pillagers attacked the shops of some Lebanese merchants after all Mauritanian-owned shops were burned or vacated. Officials said the airlift, which started in full Sunday, had carried about 8,720 Senegalese home from neighboring <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION> by midday Monday and about 5,785 Mauritanians back home from <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> were assisting in the airlift. Planes were making an average of four round trips per day, airport officials said. Among the Senegalese brought back from <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION>, some had their sex organs or limbs mutilated, and most of the corpses brought home had been decapitated, reporters said. Senegalese officials began a program to integrate the returning citizens and provide measures to fill the vacuum created by the departure of the Mauritanians, who ran 80 percent of the small businesses in this country. `` Absolute priority is being accorded to the distribution of basic foodstuffs in <LOCATION> Dakar </LOCATION> as well as the provinces,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. The violence was prompted by the killing of two Senegalese April 9 in a border village in a dispute over grazing rights between <LOCATION> Mauritanian </LOCATION> shepherds and Senegalese peasants. <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION> straddles <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> north and black <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Two-thirds of its 2 million people are Moors of Arab-Berber extraction. The rest are black, mostly from the southern river region. Nearly all of <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION>'s 7 million people are black. The dispute concerns the right of Senegalese to farm on a <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> island. After both countries became independent from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1960, the black Toucouleur people of <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION> continued to farm the Mauritanian side they had considered their own for generations. Moors to the north, traditionally nomadic herders, did not farm. But the recent completion of two dams on the river has opened up new farmland, spurred Mauritanian interest in agriculture and prompted them to force Senegalese off the land.

Phone numbers were selected randomly and interviews were conducted with the adult who had the most recent birthday, a random phenomenon. The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the sample.

The error margin is larger for subgroups. There are other sources of potential error in polls, including the wording and order of questions.

<HEAD>Gore Bill Would Regulate Chemicals that Hurt Ozone Layer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Consumer products that release chemicals into the air which `` rip up the earth's protective ozone layer'' would be regulated and those with non-essential uses would be phased out under legislation introduced Monday by Sen. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, D-Tenn. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s bill is aimed at products ranging from leaking automobile air conditioners to noise horns to some types of fire extinguishers <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> also introduced separate legislation to phase out, within five years, the most dangerous ozone-destroying chemicals and to impose a manufacturer's tax on them. An Ozone Layer Conservation Trust Fund would be established to find alternatives to such chemicals as chloroflurocarbons and halon which have been shown to deplete the ozone layer of the stratosphere. `` We know that these chemicals are ripping up the earth's protective ozone layer and contributing to the greenhouse effect,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said in a statement `` We know that if we immediately stopped all use, the problems they've already created would linger on for decades,'' he said. `` Hesitation simply can not be tolerated. We must move as quickly as possible to stop the destruction.'' He said that `` simple, common sense solutions'' are available now for application every day. `` For example, changing the way we service automobile air conditioners, labeling and eventually stopping the production of non-essential consumer products such as noise horns or party streamers or certain cleaning fluids,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said. He said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> legislation can serve as a catalyst for efforts to eliminate the threat to the ozone layer by nations around the world. `` My purpose is to sound an alarm loudly and clearly _ of imminent and grave danger _ and to describe a strategy for confronting this crisis with changes in our collective behavior and thinking which, if made, can forestall and prevent the horrendous prospect of an ecological collapse,'' he said.

 Comedian <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Piscopo </PERSON> suffered a legal defeat Monday when a state appeals court upheld most of a divorce judgment in which his ex-wife received about $ 500,000 in joint assets and custody of their only child. The three-judge panel also ruled it was not unreasonable to require <PERSON> Piscopo </PERSON> to pay $ 40,000 a year in child support, and rejected his argument that his ex-wife should not have been allowed to move to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> with his son. The movie actor and former `` Saturday Night Live'' regular's ex-wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Piscopo </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, has remarried since the 1988 divorce decree Their son is 10 years old. The appeals court also upheld an award to Mrs. <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> of $ 50,000, which was half the value placed on <PERSON> Piscopo </PERSON>'s celebrity status. `` We're disappointed that the Appellate Division did not reverse the trial court, especially on the issue of <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>'s son being removed to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Piscopo </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON>. <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON> said he would discuss with <PERSON> Piscopo </PERSON> whether to take the case to the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Piscopo </PERSON>, a former resident of Alpine, now lives in <PERSON> Sneden </PERSON>'s Landing, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> Mrs. <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>' attorney, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Abut </PERSON>, said his client was `` very pleased and hopes that with this ruling the litigation can be put to a rest and the child, who's the most important asset of this marriage, can be allowed to develop normally outside the court system.'' Abut also defended the $ 40,000-a-year child-support judgment. ` The testimony was that Mr. <PERSON> Piscopo </PERSON> in the last year before the trial was making $ 700,000 to $ 800,000, so a child support award of $ 40,000 is very reasonable,'' he said. The appellate court relied largely on established matrimonial law in ruling that the couple's assets should be evenly divided and that Mrs. <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> should receive about $ 500,000 in property and money. The court noted she had largely supported the couple while <PERSON> Piscopo </PERSON> finished college and started his comedy career. During the first decade of the marriage, until he landed the `` Saturday Night Live'' role in 1980, she also assisted his career by typing his scripts and helping him learn his lines. The court rejected arguments that the mother's move to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> was detrimental to the child. The court cited trial testimony that indicated there is a great deal of animosity by <PERSON> Piscopo </PERSON> toward his ex-wife, and that he had expressed such views in front of the child. The court also noted <PERSON> Piscopo </PERSON>'s arguments that the child and their relationship will suffer from being far away from his father. The court ruled there is no evidence the child will suffer from the move and that <PERSON> Piscopo </PERSON> has ample personal resources to keep up a weekly visitation schedule. It noted that in January alone, <PERSON> Piscopo </PERSON> traveled to seven cities in four states to make appearances. The court also agreed with the <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge's ruling that the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> living arrangements add some structure to the comedian's visits with his son. `` The trial judge found, and -LRB- <PERSON> Piscopo </PERSON> -RRB- admitted that he frequently went to <PERSON> Joey </PERSON>'s school unannounced and took <PERSON> Joey </PERSON> out of school; that he frequently made the child choose which parent should take him from school; and that he asked the child ` hundreds of times' if he wanted to go to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>,'' the court ruled.

 Police investigated a report Monday that a masked gunman abducted a baby girl from a couple who made the same complaint three years ago about another daughter who was found dead yards from their house. On Saturday, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> reported their 6-week-old daughter, <PERSON> Heather </PERSON>, missing from her bassinet after a masked gunman knocked Mrs. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> unconscious, police said. The report was identical to one filed in 1986 in nearby <LOCATION> Brighton </LOCATION> when the <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>' 13-day-old daughter, <LOCATION> Loralei </LOCATION>, turned up missing. Her body was found five days later about 150 feet from the <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>' house. No arrest was made although the parents were considered supsects. `` What are the chances of somebody breaking into your house and taking your small infant child once in your life?'' said police Sgt. <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>. `` You figure out the odds, and then figure out the odds that it could happen a second time in a completely different city. But I'm not trying to say anything.'' The Sims have an unlisted telephone number and could not immediately be reached. Madison County State's Attorney <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Haine </PERSON> also did not immediately return telephone calls. On Monday, police in this <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> city across from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> said they were still treating <PERSON> Heather </PERSON>'s disappearance as a reported kidnapping. `` We are doing everything we can possibly do, but we have no idea where the child is,'' said police Sgt. <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> Pyatt </PERSON>. `` We were told -LRB- Mrs. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> -RRB- was approached by a male outside the home, forced back inside the house and knocked unconscious,'' said <PERSON> Pyatt </PERSON>. `` But we have no information other than what was obtained yesterday.'' Sgt. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> of the <PERSON> Alton </PERSON> <PERSON> Police </PERSON> said there was `` no physical evidence'' that Mrs. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> had been struck. `` There is nothing that disproves their allegations,'' said <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>. `` But we are not discounting the information from the other case.'' The reported timing of the abductions was nearly identical. In 1986, Mrs. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> said she was knocked out about 10:20 p.m. On Saturday, she told police the assailant struck at 10:30 p.m. as she took out the trash. Police said a 15-month-old son was sleeping in the house at the time Mrs. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> said <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> was abducted, but the boy was not disturbed. No valuables were reported missing. Mrs. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> told police her husband arrived home Saturday night about an hour after she was knocked out and revived her. Police searched around the <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> home on Sunday, and <PERSON> Pyatt </PERSON> said investigators might broaden the search. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>' brother-in-law, <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Condray </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Cottage </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, said police had advised the couple to make no public statement about the case. `` They told the parents to let the police handle it and that's what they're doing,'' he said. The family lived in <LOCATION> Brighton </LOCATION>, about 10 miles north of <LOCATION> Alton </LOCATION>, in 1986 when <PERSON> Mrs. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>, then 27, reported a masked gunman entered her home, ordered her to lie down, and took <PERSON> Loralei </PERSON> from her bassinet. In each case, <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> was at work at the time his daughters disappeared. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> works at <ORGANIZATION> Laclede </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Alton </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Yocom </PERSON> said <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> and his wife were suspects in <PERSON> Loralei </PERSON>'s death. But the couple declined to testify before a grand jury investigation, citing their constitutional right for protection against self-incrimination, and the panel took no action, <PERSON> Yocom </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Loralei </PERSON>'s disappearance touched off an intensive search. Leaflets with the infant's picture were distributed and the parents pleaded for help finding their daughter. When her body was found five days later it was so decomposed a cause of death could not be determined. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> and his wife insisted in 1986 they had nothing to do with <PERSON> Loralei </PERSON>'s disappearance and death. The couple moved to the two-story frame home in <LOCATION> Alton </LOCATION> about two years ago. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>, then 34, installed a tall chainlink fence around the front yard shortly after moving to <PERSON> Alton </PERSON>, neighbors said.

<HEAD>State Resumes Job Safety Enforcement After Nearly Two Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 State inspectors resumed investigations of accidents and safety complaints at businesses on Monday, nearly two years after Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> virtually dismantled their agency. `` All 21 district offices around the state opened for business today,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON>, said spokesman for the state Industrial Relations Department that oversees the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, or Cal-OSHA. The agency is being restored under terms of a statewide ballot measure last November that reversed the Republican governor's decision In July 1987, <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> cut most of the funding for the $ 7 million state-run program as a cost-saving measure. His action turned over to the federal government the responsibility for monitoring job safety in the private sector, where 10.5 million Californians work. All that remained of Cal-OSHA was an inspection program for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s 1.7 million state and local government workers. But a coalition of labor, environmental, business, medical and education groups spearheaded Proposition 97 to restore <ORGANIZATION> Cal-OSHA </ORGANIZATION>, saying the federal <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> provided workers with far fewer protections than the state agency. Voters passed the initiative by a margin of 54 percent to 46 percent. Under a federal-state agreement announced last month, inspectors for both agencies will police worker safety in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> for the next five months as the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> brings <ORGANIZATION> Cal-OSHA </ORGANIZATION> back to life. As the state program returns to full strength, the federal presence will be phased out so the state can assume full control on Oct. 1. `` They'll have some growing pains, but we anticipate -LRB- Cal-OSHA -RRB- will be back on stream very rapidly,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Munn </PERSON> of the Associated General Contractors of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, which pushed for restoring Cal-OSHA. About 140 state inspectors were on the job Monday, with the number scheduled to climb gradually to 214, <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> said. State inspectors will respond to all complaints of unsafe working conditions in the private sector. During the transition, the federal <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> will continue to conduct regularly scheduled inspections in selected industries. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Strasheim </PERSON>, regional chief for federal <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>, said his staff will retain jurisdiction over complaints received before May 1. Federal inspectors will retain responsibility for the safety of people who work at federal installations or aboard ships in federal waters.

 Worshipers at a rural church gathered to mourn Monday at the parsonage where their minister, his wife and two children were found shot to death. `` It's just a small country church and everyone's real close,'' said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Schafer </PERSON>, a member of the congregation. The minister's son, 17-year-old <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelley </PERSON>, returned to the house briefly to retrieve his belongings, then crossed the gravel parking lot of the church to console grieving members of the small congregation before leaving with friends. The bodies of the Rev. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelley </PERSON>, 38, his 32-year-old wife, <PERSON> Dawn </PERSON>, and daughters <PERSON> Janel </PERSON>, 8, and <PERSON> Jolene </PERSON>, 6, were found Sunday morning after the family failed to appear for services at the <ORGANIZATION> Olive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Branch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brethen </ORGANIZATION> in Christ. Police have ruled out burglary or theft, as well as murder-suicide. They have refused to discuss any motives they may be aware of. The four victims all apparently were shot at close range with the same weapon, said <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joseph </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's Sgt. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Feirrell </PERSON>. Results from autopsies were not expected before Tuesday, said <PERSON> Feirrell </PERSON>. The Pelleys had married after their first spouses died, congregation members said. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelley </PERSON>, 14, were <PERSON> Pelley </PERSON>'s children from his first marriage, and 10-year-old <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON>, <PERSON> Janel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jolene </PERSON> were Ms. <PERSON> Pelley </PERSON>'s children. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelley </PERSON> was at an amusement park north of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> for a high school prom celebration when the slayings occurred, <PERSON> Feirrell </PERSON> said. His sister, <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON>, was attending church camp for the weekend, and stepsister <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> stayed overnight with friends. The Rev. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Merrilatt </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brethren </ORGANIZATION> pastor from a nearby town, said <PERSON> Pelley </PERSON> had just written a paper on merging broken families for a counseling course the two attended at a church college. He said <PERSON> Pelley </PERSON> had talked about friction among the children in the new family, but declined to elaborate. However, church member <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> <PERSON> Roush </PERSON>, 66, said she babysat frequently for the <PERSON> Pelley </PERSON>'s younger children and noticed no signs of strain. `` They all got along fine,'' she said. The Pelleys had been married about five years, and had produced no children of their own. At least 20 members of the congregation gathered Monday at the church in <LOCATION> Lakeville </LOCATION>, which sits about halfway between <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Members of neighboring churches brought dishes of cold cuts and salads. `` You have a bond here that a lot of times you do n't find in a bigger church,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorpe </PERSON>, a former pastor at the church who came from his home in nearby <LOCATION> Kendallville </LOCATION>. On Sunday, when <PERSON> Pelley </PERSON> failed to appear for the 9:30 a.m. service, the nearly 70 congregants there thought he might be playing a joke, <PERSON> Schafer </PERSON> said. Another church member began the service, but all grew increasingly worried as Ms. <PERSON> Pelley </PERSON> and the children failed to appear. Church trustee <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hathaway </PERSON> went to the parsonage and found the bodies.

 A white wolf that ran wild in an affluent residential area and ate a pet rabbit belongs to <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who played comic book hero <PERSON> Flash </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> in a 1980 movie, animal regulation officials said Monday. `` We believe he purchased it as a pup from a breeder so it was raised in a sort of domestic environment. But still, you ca n't have them,'' said Lt. <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> of the city's <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> Animal Shelter. The 100-pound wolf, a full-grown female named Hurricane, was captured April 14 near the <LOCATION> Encino </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reservoir </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. Residents of the hillside neighborhood had complained that a huge white dog had been roaming the area for about two months and gobbled down a rabbit. <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> said the predator is probably an endangered gray wolf, which lives in the wild in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. It is illegal to keep wolves within city limits without a permit. The misdemeanor offense is punishable by a fine of up to $ 500 and six months in jail, but there were no immediate plans to prosecute <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> said. In addition to `` Flash <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> appeared in `` 10,'' in 1979, `` My Chauffeur,'' in 1986 and in the TV series `` <PERSON> Hardcastle </PERSON> and <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON>'' and `` <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' personal manager, <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamens </PERSON>, said he had no knowledge of the matter and would have no comment. Hurricane apparently lived on the run by hunting wild rabbits, ground squirrels, opossums and quail in the uninhabited brush around the reservoir, which abuts the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>. A bait trap cage was set for Hurricane, who was described as `` very shy and withdrawn'' by <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, animal regulation district supervisor. `` We want to give the wolf to some type of a sanctuary that can handle that type of animal. We just do n't want to send it anywhere,'' he said. `` She's not going back to the owner.''

 At least 25 imprisoned Tamil rebels overpowered Indian soldiers guarding a jail in northern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> on Monday and escaped with weapons and ammunition, residents said. Residents and witnesses to the breakout at <LOCATION> Vavuniya </LOCATION> town, 135 miles north of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, said other Tamils apparently created a diversion by firing at a nearby Indian sentry post. An <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman could not confirm the break, the first by Tamil separatists since Indian troops began peacekeeping operations in 1987. The spokeswoman can not be identified under briefing rules.

Previous government peace overtures to Tamil rebels touched off a violent backlash by Sinhalese militants, who complained that offers made in the India-sponsored peace accord of July 1987 conceded too much to the Tamils and who then launched their own agitation against the government. Sinhalese form 75 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people and dominate the government and the military. Tamils make up 18 perecent and claim they are discriminated in jobs and education by the Sinhalese. Indian soldiers are deployed in the island's north and east to enforce the 1987 accord and disarm Tamils who have fought for six years for a separate nation.

 Poles shouted `` Down with communism!'' at a May Day march in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, Soviet Armenians defied a ban on demonstrations, and rallies became riots in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> as workers Monday marked their worldwide holiday. Clashes in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> left 36 people injured, riot squads fired tear gas when leftists tried to march on the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, and thousands burned <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flags in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> held a traditional parade through Red Square, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> used the occasion to try to ease a burgeoning student uprising, and a man holding a poster of Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was dragged away by police in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. Around the world, thousands gathered on the international labor day to celebrate their gains with banners and balloons, or protest their losses with hurled rocks and smashed windows. Up to 100,000 Solidarity supporters marched through <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> in the union's first legal May Day gathering since it was suppressed eight years ago. Workers chanted `` Down with communism!'' during the impressive show of strength. `` We not only can organize uprisings ... we can also build a normal democratric order,'' <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Bujak </PERSON> told the crowd, referring to recent reforms that resulted in Solidarity's legalization and opposition participation in elections. <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>'s main events were peaceful, but violent clashes were reported in the cities of <LOCATION> Wroclaw </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> when militant Solidarity splinter groups held demonstrations in those cities, dissident sources said. Street fighting in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> lasted several hours. In the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, police swung truncheons and fired tear gas to break up crowds marching to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> after a rally in which union leaders threatened a nationwide strike to press for a higher minimum wage. Riot police in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> fired tear gas in a battle with about 5,000 striking workers in <LOCATION> Masan </LOCATION> and nearby <LOCATION> Changwon </LOCATION> after protesters tried to stage a May Day rally, police said. About 200 workers were arrested. Police said about 6,600 people were arrested in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> when police blocked a rally Sunday called by labor groups to mark May Day. In <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, at least 76 people were arrested Monday for taking part in anti-government protests that broke out during the official May Day parade in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. One protester was arrested as he carried a poster of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, whose reforms go further than those desired by <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s leaders. An additional 18 were arrested during rallies in the city of <LOCATION> Brno </LOCATION>, said activist <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabatova </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> reporter <PERSON> Misha </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenny </PERSON> said he was punched in the face and held for five hours as he photographed an arrest in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said it would protest to <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. In the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, an activist in the Soviet republic of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> said residents in the capital, <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, defied a ban and held a large, peaceful rally. May Day celebrations were banned in the <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, because of recent pro-independence unrest in both cities and the devastating earthquake in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. The mood was festive in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> under sunny skies during the traditional May Day parade through Red Square. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and other officials stood atop <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>'s tomb as thousands of marchers waved colorful banners, pushed floats and floated balloons. In <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, 36 people were injured in battles with security forces during outlawed May Day marches in <LOCATION> Istanbul </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Anatolia </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. Eight of them were wounded by gunfire, including one man who was shot in the head. Officials banned the holiday because they said it was a Marxist tradition. The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said 400 people were detained in <LOCATION> Istanbul </LOCATION> during unauthorized marches and another 500 in the <LOCATION> Aegean </LOCATION> coastal city of <LOCATION> Izmir </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, police used water cannon, tear gas and truncheons against at least 2,000 militant protesters who hurled fire bombs, looted stores and smashed windows in violent May Day skirmishes that continued into late Monday. Police said small, roving groups of masked protesters firebombed parked cars in the <LOCATION> Kreuzberg </LOCATION> district, with several cars catching fire and exploding. They said a policeman was knocked down and beaten and his service pistol was stolen. In communist <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, at least five dissidents were arrested for staging demonstrations alongside official celebrations, dissident sources said. In <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, where authorities are struggling with a student movement for democratic reforms, the Communist Party marked May Day by appealing to workers to resist forces of social instability. In <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, police said 1.1 million people took part in May Day rallies. Some evolved into peaceful protests against the stock-profiteering scandal that has shaken the government and prompted the resignation of Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, more than 50,000 people demonstrated in six cities and burned <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flags to protest the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military presence in the country and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s support for the Nicaraguan rebels. Pro-government and opposition labor leaders at separate rallies in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> demanded that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade embargoes on <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> be lifted. <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON>, president of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Confederation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unification </ORGANIZATION>, said those who suffer `` are not the Sandinista leaders, but the workers and the people.'' In <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, military ruler <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> raised the monthly mimimum wage to $ 72, up $ 10 from the previous minimum but below the $ 112 sought by labor unions. In <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, troops kept opposition groups from joining a government-organized rally in the Zocalo, the city's main plaza. After about 150,000 pro-government unionists ended their parade, at least 30,000 dissident unionists and other demonstrators were allowed into the Zocalo to listen to speeches from their leaders. Blue wire fences, soldiers armed with automatic rifles and police on horseback and with dogs held back the dissidents through the morning.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> threatened Monday to withhold <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> financial contributions to the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> if it votes to admit the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. `` He feels very strongly about this,'' said <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, in announcing <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s position. She said if threat of a cutoff did not deter the 166-member WHO from admitting the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> at a meeting next week in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would consider other, unspecified steps. The head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agency was expected at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday to plead for continued <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> financial support. Dr. <PERSON> Hiroshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakajima </PERSON>, a Japanese physician, said in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on Saturday he had tried to persuade <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> to withdraw the application. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> deputy ambassador to <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, informed <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballaoui </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> of the decision at a meeting Monday in <LOCATION> Carthage </LOCATION> that focused on WHO membership. Asked if the dispute would curtail the dialogue the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> began with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> in December, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said `` there is no hint of that.'' The talks were based on a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> judgment that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> had renounced terrorism and had accepted <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist. The statement read by Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> in behalf of <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> made no reference to terrorism. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> vigorously opposes the admission of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to membership in the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> or any other <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agency,'' it said. `` We have worked and will continue to work to convince others of the harm that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s admission would cause to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace process and to the U.N. system.'' It added: `` Political questions such as this should not be raised in specialized agencies because such politicization detracts from the important technical work of these organizations. `` To emphasize the depth of our concern, I will recommend to the president that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> make no further contributions, voluntary or assessed, to any international organization which makes any change in the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s present status as an observer organization.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> bears about 25 percent of the burden of <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> expenses. This amounted to about $ 150 million in the last two years. More than 50 senators have signed a letter to <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> saying they favored cutting off funds to the WHO or any other <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agency that admitted <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s organization, which is recognized by all 21 <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> governments as the sole, legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. Last year, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> declared statehood on land held by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> last month said he was opposed to an independent Palestinian state. `` We do not recognize them as a state, nor do we believe they meet the criteria of being a state,'' Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official acknowledged `` it is a very tough decision'' to threaten a cutoff of financial support to the world health group. <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reich </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presidents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Major </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizations </ORGANIZATION>, said he was gratified by <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s statement `` which underscores the seriousness with which our country views this issue.'' <PERSON> Reich </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> was trying to gain `` back-door admission'' to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> itself. `` Should the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> succeed,'' he said, `` a dangerous precedent will be set.'' But <PERSON> Clovis </PERSON> <PERSON> Maksoud </PERSON>, director of the League of <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said if the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> does carry through with its threat, it would be `` making, perhaps unwittingly, the peace process hostage to the most intransigent of Israeli policies. Admitting Palestine to <ORGANIZATION> WHO </ORGANIZATION> contributes, in our opinion, to its universality, and therefore effectiveness.''

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> officials Monday released a revised plan for cleansing 364 miles of Alaskan coastline fouled by the nation's largest oil spill, but said their proposal requires a suspension of local environmental laws. The plan makes no provisions for continuing the cleanup beyond mid-September, and notes that 191 miles of lightly oiled coastline may not be cleaned mechanically at all, but be allowed to be washed naturally by the environment. `` It is expected that this will be the case for all lightly oiled Gulf of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> sites,'' said the two-part, 60-page report. `` We are going to have to take a hard look at that,'' responded <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamoreaux </PERSON>, the ranking state environmental official monitoring the cleanup. Since March 24, when an <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> tanker struck a reef outside <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> and poured more than 10 million gallons of North Slope crude into <LOCATION> Prince </LOCATION> <LOCATION> William </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> has financed cleanup crews fighting the spreading sludge. Signs of the spill have been sighted about 500 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>. The oil company's strategy, which was submitted to state and federal authorities only hours before a deadline expired, divides <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s oil-tainted shores into four categories _ from the most heavily polluted to those that are `` only lightly oiled.'' It covers polluted areas within Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>, as well as those outside the immediate spill zone, and calls for nearly 3,400 workers to participate in the cleanup. The worst areas _ three miles of sludge-covered beaches on several small islands _ would be targeted immediately, with the others scheduled for gradual cleansing through Sept. 15. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s plan calls for the recovered waste to be strained for usable oil that can be refined, and said the oil-laced wastewater could be treated at the <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s disposal plant in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>. The gunk and sludge that resists treatment or salvage will be burned or buried, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> study. Both methods likely will require exemptions from local environmental laws. <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Adm. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the ranking federal official tracking the cleanup, told reporters in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> that he would decide whether to approve the proposal within a week. Before the plan was released, <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> said he wanted much more detail than <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s original cleanup plan, which included nothing on polluted areas outside the sound. <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> is scheduled to arrive in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> on Tuesday to review the latest plan. Meanwhile, tar and sludge from the Valdez spill fouled the beaches of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s wild <ORGANIZATION> Katmai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION>, drenching hundreds of sea otters and birds and threatening the huge brown bears prowling the refuge. The damage stretches along 260 miles of rocky, rugged coastline southwestward from <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Douglas </LOCATION> some 500 miles from <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, park superintendent <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Bane </PERSON> said Monday. `` The oil has made landfall in large quantities in <LOCATION> Katmai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hallo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. There is a heavy impact. We have seen several hundred sea otters swimming in oil. The oil has had an impact on virtually the entire coastline of the park,'' <PERSON> Bane </PERSON> said. The 4 million-acre park also is a haven for brown bears, a coastal cousin of the grizzly. `` A number of bears have been seen walking in the vicinity of the beaches. We have one verified sighting of a bear walking through the oil,'' <PERSON> Bane </PERSON> said. Bane said an aerial survey showed an amorphous oil patch 10 miles wide and more than 20 miles long in the <LOCATION> Shelikof </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION>, which is located along the migration route used by whales. Exxon is feeling the effects of the spill far beyond <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> waters. Several groups throughout the country have called for a boycott Tuesday of Exxon products. In <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, a group called the <ORGANIZATION> Boycott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> has scheduled a rally in front of <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> headquarters. The attorneys general of <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state scheduled a news conference Tuesday to call for a federal investigation into the sharp rise in the price of gasoline since the spill. The oil industry blames the spill and crude oil prices that have risen $ 7 a barrel since January for higher prices at the gas pumps. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> also received sharp criticism from the federal government, which accused the company of `` foot-dragging'' in the construction of a second facility in <LOCATION> Seward </LOCATION> to aid in the cleanup of sea otters fouled by the oil. The animals depend on their thick fur for insulation against the cold water but the oil ruins the insulation effect. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> says the center will open Wednesday.

 Former French Premier <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> took a sentimental journey through this college town Monday on the first day of a nine-day cross-country trip. <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, who recently began his third term as mayor of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, planned the trip as a way of `` staying in touch with the major players in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' spokesman <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Lellouche </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> plans to meet with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. He is scheduled to meet this week in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with former Secretary of State <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> before traveling to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, where he plans to visit former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and dine with such actors as <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>. `` I prefer the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and my daughter likes the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, so we're doing both,'' said <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>. His daughter <PERSON> Claude </PERSON>, 25, was among a dozen French advisers and journalists along for the trip. <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> attended a luncheon at the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> before wandering awhile along the <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION> streets he first haunted in 1952 as a summer student at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>'s business school. <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, 56, smiled as familiar sights jogged his memory. He recalled the giddiness of his first visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> woman he fell in love with while working as a soda jerk at the old <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s in <LOCATION> Harvard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>. `` It was a wonderful time,'' he said. `` It pleases me to relive it.'' More recently, times have been tougher for <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> neo-Gaullist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION>, who lost his bid last year to unseat socialist President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterand </PERSON>. Not only did the conservative candidate lose the May 1988 race, his party also lost its majority coalition in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, forcing him to resign as prime minister. <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> had held the posts of prime minister and <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> mayor simultaneously. It is not uncommon for French officials to hold two important elected jobs. <PERSON> Lellouche </PERSON> said <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> has emerged from a post-election letdown, during which he was relatively withdrawn. `` This is a man who was defeated,'' the spokesman said. `` It's a time of opposition, and a time of learning.'' Later Monday, <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> spoke in French to an audience of about 150 students, faculty and members of the local French community at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>'s Center for European Studies.

 Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> repeated his support for <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> resistance leader Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> on Monday, but the vice president and his aides said a meeting between the two had brought no changes in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy toward that country. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, spending a day here after touring <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, met for 45 minutes with <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>. The vice president also talked about trade issues and human rights with <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Suharto </PERSON>. But much of the day's focus was on the meeting with <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, who is visiting <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> along with the leaders of two other factions hopeful of running <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> after the promised fall withdrawal of Vietnamese occupation troops. The fourth group vying for control in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> is the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, a Chinese-backed organization that was responsible for killing as many as 1.5-million Cambodians from 1975 to 1979. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have said they will not tolerate a Cambodian government dominated by the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. Meantime, <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s Vietnamese-installed government has changed the country's name and flag, and invited <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> to return home and help rule. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> welcomed the concessions and appeared ready to make a few of his own to end the 10-year conflict. `` It seems that we are at the end of the tunnel. We are going to make progress on the way toward a settlement,'' <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has said that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is considering giving military aid to <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> and possibly the other non-communist <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> faction, headed by <PERSON> Son </PERSON> <PERSON> Sann </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said such aid did not come up in his discussions with <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>. Asked if <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid might be overt or covert, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> responded there was a mixed view on the subject _ `` mixed being some overt, some covert.'' What he and <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> did discuss, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, was `` the process and moving the process forward and timetables and ... who the players are and what some of the expectations would be.'' <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> supports an international conference on <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> that could lead to an enforcement mechanism to monitor the withdrawal of the Vietnamese and to cope with a transition government until elections are held. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> backs making <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> the interim leader until free elections can be held. Later, at a news conference before leaving <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> remains totally opposed to giving the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roupe </ORGANIZATION> any controlling role in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. `` It's a non-starter from the very beginning,'' he said. `` We do n't believe that Khmer rouge offer anything ... but mass murder,'' An aide to <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, speaking on condition he remain anonymous, said that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> will relay his information to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and that it might be several months before the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> decides whether to alter its policy toward <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. With <PERSON> Suharto </PERSON>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> took up human rights issues, particularly allegations that <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> has more than 400 political prisoners and has used repressive tactics in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Timor </LOCATION>, a former <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> colony annexed by <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> in 1975. Some 30 members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had urged <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> to take up the human rights issue. In addition, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> met with three human rights activists, including <PERSON> Shamet </PERSON> <PERSON> Bratanata </PERSON>. With <PERSON> Suharto </PERSON>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> advocated that <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> practice `` political development'' as well as economic development. Other issues that were brought up with officials of <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, considered a strong <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ally, were trade and space. On Tuesday Quayle heads for <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and then on to <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, the last two overseas stops on his 12-day trip.

 Pro-government and opposition labor leaders at separate May Day rallies demanded Monday that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> lift its trade embargo on <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. `` We're asking that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> lift the embargo because those who suffer are not the Sandinista leaders, but the workers and the people of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON>, president of the opposition Confederation for Labor Unification. He spoke to about 4,000 demonstrators opposing the leftist Sandinista government who later marched for two hours through working-class neighborhoods of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> under a sweltering midday sun. Earlier Monday, about 20,000 pro-government demonstrators gathered at the <ORGANIZATION> Plaza </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> la </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolucion </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>'s former downtown area, destroyed by a 1972 earthquake. <PERSON> Lucio </PERSON> <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON>, secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, condemned the 4-year-old <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic blockade and accused `` reactionary Nicaraguan capitalists'' of impeding the country's industries He praised the government's call to investors to help reactivate <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s paralyzed economy, warning them this was their chance `` for continuing to live or disappear.'' <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Tirado </PERSON>, one of the nine members of the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Directorate </ORGANIZATION>, told the rally peace wo n't come to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> until the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> stops supporting the Nicaraguan rebels, known as Contras. Last month <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approved a $ 49.7 million package of non-lethal aid for the Contras, most of whom are living in jungle camps in neighboring <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> cut off all financial aid to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in 1981 after alleging the Sandinista government was supporting leftist insurgents in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. In 1985, then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> imposed a commercial embargo on this Central American country, saying <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> had established close military ties with <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Private buiness people say the embargo is n't halting the flow of U.S.-made goods to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and only makes parts and equipment more expensive to acquire because they have to route the items through a third country. Economists say the government's 3-month-old austerity program is showing results in slowing hyperinflation that topped 20,000 percent in 1988. But they say those same measures have created a recession that could prove fatal to the economy if allowed to continue into the planting season. The season traditionally starts in mid-May, the beginning of the rainy season. President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> is on a 10-country European tour to ask for more financial aid for <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, the main West European supporter of the 10-year-old Sandinista revolution, has organized a <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> conference May 11-12 so <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> can present his case before potential donors.

Hit with `Nothing Sacred' ^By SOLL SUSSMAN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> does n't hesitate to confess his amusement and elation at his success in his chosen field of drama. `` I just laughed out loud on the subway,'' he said, recalling a recent ride in his hometown of <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>. `` I'm a playwright _ and I have children to support.'' He laughed again. The bearded, 41-year-old <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> never has had as successful a year as the past one, with `` Nothing Sacred'' a staple on the repertory theater circuit from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>' Mark Taper Forum to the <ORGANIZATION> Hartford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. Time magazine named it one of the 10 best plays of 1988, although it has yet to be performed in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The play is his 18th, yet <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> recalled that when his first play was produced it was only the second play he had ever seen. `` I was just attracted to the idea that you could fill it up any way you want,'' he said to explain his attraction to the theater. The jovial, soft-spoken <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> for the opening of `` Nothing Sacred,'' in a production very similar to its <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> origin, at <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s modern <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> keeps the 19th century Russian setting for his version of <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Turgenev </PERSON>'s `` Fathers and Sons,'' but insists that it now is very much a modern, Canadian work. He first read the original when he was 17 and said he thinks he was in a bit of a trance when he wrote his version. `` I never meant it to be an adaptation,'' he said over lunch before opening night in <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION>. `` I wrote it in 10 to 11 days.'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> wanted to bill the play as `` inspired by <PERSON> Turgenev </PERSON>,'' but then decided that would be `` hokey.'' `` Mostly I thought, ` if I just let it come through me, so the language would be, without being forced, for actors living now.''' Literature was the starting point for `` Nothing Sacred'' just as other inspirations have come from something read in the newspaper or a conversation with a friend. `` I'm sure if <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> were alive, he'd be on my side,'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said about criticism of his adaptation. Much of his earlier work was of a more eccentric tone, in line with his development in the <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> alternative theater scene of the'70s. The appeal of the theater, he said, is its access, that the multimillion dollar budgets required for movies generally are not needed to create plays. Thinking back 12 or 15 years to his early career, <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> again laughed at the contrast to the days when the crowds were smaller and the theaters less established. `` When you're used to seeing 200 or 300 people come in, and then you see 800 or 900,'' he joked. `` Where are we going to put them all?'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> agent, <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON>, astutely pitched `` Nothing Sacred'' last year to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> repertory theaters, and there's been some sniping that the success has as much to do with the politics of regional theater as it does with the play. Time, reviewing the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> production, said he `` persuasively makes the debate among student anarchists in 1860s <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> echo that among Marxist collegians of 1960s <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> gave a decidedly mixed review to the production of `` Nothing Sacred'' at <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stage </LOCATION>, saying <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> assumed too much artistic license for a project that could have used a bit more reverence. On the other hand, <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> believes it's time for the dominant role of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> reviews to be re-evaluated in light of the changing theater scene that is less concentrated on <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION>. The playwright also said many Canadians gripe about the lack of knowledge in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> about their country, but he chalked that off to a result of Americans' self-preoccupation. `` They do n't know <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> is up here feeling insecure about its culture,'' he said. `` They -LRB- Americans -RRB- are generous: ` Come in. Be one of us.' I've never felt, ` you intruder.' It's kind of positive in its own way.'' Some comment has been made that <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> is an example of a classic Canadian case, of gaining legitimacy at home only after being discovered in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But he believes his steady career in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> was quite established before productions started of his plays in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> theaters. `` I think the message Canadians always had was that we did n't need to develop our own,'' he said, recalling the days when Canadian theater was dominated by imports from Broadway or <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> `` Somewhere along the line you go, ` Hey, wait. I can do that too.''' And, for those Canadians who did n't hear about him until `` Nothing Sacred'' appeared on <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION>'s Top 10 list, <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said simply: `` That's OK. I read Time.''

<TEXT>
 The story of four single women who look for the perfect prince but have to kiss a lot of frogs along the way is the latest hit comedy movie in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The movie also blasts others in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s young social scene, from yuppies who marry only for tax breaks to far-out leftist activists. The movie `` <PERSON> Beim </PERSON> naechsten <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> wird alles anders'' -LRB- `` With the Next Man Everything Will Be Different'' -RRB- is based on a best-selling book of the same title by writer <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Heller </PERSON>, who has also published collections of satirical cartoons. The film, released in January, was rated No. 5 on the hit movie list published by the Hamburg-based weekly magazine <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> in its March 2 issue. That made `` <PERSON> Beim </PERSON> naechsten Mann'' the second-highest ranked West German movie on the list after `` Herbstmilch,'' the poignant tale of a young Bavarian farm woman during the Nazi era. Movies focusing on women are still unusual in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, despite the success in recent years of woman directors such as <PERSON> Doris </PERSON> <PERSON> Doerrie </PERSON>, whose 1985 film `` Maenner'' -LRB- `` Men'' -RRB- was an international hit. The heroine of the movie is <PERSON> Constanze </PERSON> <PERSON> Wechselburger </PERSON>, a film student who sees herself as intellectual, political and prominent in the feminist movement, even though she spends most of her time hunting for men. The film opens with a chaotic battle between <PERSON> Constanze </PERSON> and her boyfriend, <PERSON> Albert </PERSON>, a young doctor whom she eventually dumps for allegedly being both bourgeois and cheap. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> criticizes <PERSON> Constanze </PERSON> for her wastefulness, cutting open a discarded toothpaste tube with a scalpel to show there was enough toothpaste left for several more brushings. <PERSON> Constanze </PERSON> is quick to retaliate. `` This is what I think of your cheap Christmas present,'' she yells, flushing her own gift to <PERSON> Albert </PERSON>, an expensive watch, down the toilet. <PERSON> Constanze </PERSON> confides her troubles to her girlfriends over numerous glasses of wine, most frequently in a local bar called the Cafe Kaputt. `` I'm looking for a relationship that is built on an intellectual basis, not a material one,'' she says. She also insists on `` emotional freedom,'' rejecting marriage as a bourgeois institution. Ironically, she lands in the arms of a married man. Film instructor <PERSON> Gottfried </PERSON> <PERSON> Schachtschnabel </PERSON>, a veteran of the 1960s student revolts, sports a three-day beard and pretentious leftist political attitudes. He, too, rejects the notion of marriage, but does n't bother getting divorced. He `` forgets'' to inform his girlfriends about his status, and defends himself when he's caught. `` <PERSON> Marx </PERSON> was married, too. And he had an affair with his housekeeper. We can only learn from that,'' he tells <PERSON> Constanze </PERSON>. There's also <PERSON> Sieglinde </PERSON>, a social-climbing dental assistant whose yuppie boyfriend marries her for tax savings; the old-fashioned <PERSON> Birgit </PERSON>, who looks for her dream man in the want ads; and <PERSON> Julia </PERSON>, a psychologist who also falls prey to <LOCATION> Schachtschnabel </LOCATION>. It's a film with which West Germans can apparently both laugh and identify. `` The characters may be cliches, but everybody recognizes a few things that are true in real life, aspects he can relate to,'' <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Marquis </PERSON> of the film's Berlin-based production company said in a recent interview. Although the film focuses on women and the title indicates disappointment with men, it is not just a work for feminists, she said. `` The story is really about curiosity, not disappointment,'' <PERSON> Marquis </PERSON> said. `` Both men and women are often bored with what they have and think another relationship would be better. But, as the film shows, that is n't always the case.'' By the end of the film <PERSON> Constanze </PERSON> succumbs to bourgeois society and gets married after all. She chooses <PERSON> Albert </PERSON>, deciding that thriftiness is not the worst vice in the world.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Melgarejo </PERSON> is trying to cool the fever in a country where gambling is a major sport, musical slot machines abound and nearly everyone takes a flyer on <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gordo </LOCATION>, the fat Christmas lottery. His shoestring version of Gamblers Anonymous is called the <ORGANIZATION> Madrid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recovering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamblers </ORGANIZATION>. The telephone has been ringing constantly since he mentioned the number on a radio program and told listeners with gambling problems to call. In the four months since, he says, the membership has grown from nearly zero to more than 200. An estimated 50,000 addicted gamblers live in and around the capital. `` It's hang up, answer, hang up, answer,'' said <PERSON> Melgarejo </PERSON>, a reformed gambler who blamed the addiction for ruining his first marriage. He interrupted the interview at a temporary office in a <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> Roman Catholic church to talk with a middle-aged woman who walked in off the street to confess an addiction to slot machines. <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> has 420,000 `` habitual gamblers,'' 3 percent of the adult population, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gambling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. They are caught in a tradition that goes back at least to 1763, when <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> started the world's longest-running public lottery. `` The difference between ` habitual gamblers' and ` addicts' is basically a semantic one,'' said <PERSON> Santiago </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendioroz </PERSON>, head of gambling commission. Spaniards placed $ 29 billion in bets last year, according to the commission. It regulates state-run lotteries and sports pools, and casinos, bingo halls and slot machines, which were legalized in 1977 after a 53-year ban. <PERSON> Mendioroz </PERSON> said the government's take from lotteries, pools and fees last year was more than $ 2.2 billion. Press reports say <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> ranks second in the world in gambling expenditures per capita, behind the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and ahead of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mendioroz </PERSON> says there are `` no reliable figures, but because of the slot machines in bars and restaurants gambling is omnipresent.'' Slots, which blare bits of music as reminders of their presence, are found in 80 percent of the more than 200,000 bars and cafes, commission figures indicate. <PERSON> Mendioroz </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> has 310,000 of the machines. One sure sign of a gambling problem, he said, is that 8,000 people have asked his commission not to let them into casinos and bingo halls. He described the number as surprisingly high considering the custom in this Roman Catholic country of hiding such failings. `` Gambling is considered a vice, almost a sin, and the person who has that problem is very reluctant to admit it,'' he said. <PERSON> Melgarejo </PERSON>, a 44-year-old insurance agent, devotes much of his time to unpaid missionary work with gamblers. He says 18 years of gambling cost him his first wife, `` 10 or 12 jobs'' and about $ 217,000. Last year he spent three months at the <ORGANIZATION> Cordoba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recovering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamblers </ORGANIZATION> and managed to conquer the habit. His organization and the original self-help group in <LOCATION> Cordoba </LOCATION> are the only two in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Melgarejo </PERSON> said a national federation may result if enough others are formed. He believes the Spanish character encourages gambling. `` It's like <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Quixote </PERSON>,'' he said. `` The Spaniard ... is a romantic. He believes in fantasy, in destiny. He thinks he can solve a lifetime's worth of problems with one stroke of luck.'' End Adv PM Fri May 5

<TEXT>
 With about 200 stations now programming in Spanish to the tune of $ 176 million in advertising revenue last year, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Hispanic radio is booming. But the sound was n't always sweet, as seen in the new film, `` Break of Dawn.'' The movie, released in selected Southwestern cities, re-creates the story of <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> radio pioneer <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, who was imprisoned after his on-air protests of Depression-era deportations of Mexicans. `` It's a story about justice prevailing over injustice,'' said producer <PERSON> Jude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pauline </PERSON> <PERSON> Eberhard </PERSON>. Set in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> in the 1920s and'30s, the film tells how <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> was paroled after being sent to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quentin </LOCATION> on trumped up rape charges following his advocacy broadcasts. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> parlayed his musical talents and eye for business into a popular Spanish-language radio program. But it ended when he was sent to prison on charges that were later recanted by the woman who had allegedly been raped. Mexican recording star <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> plays <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, portraying him as he first translates radio commercials into Spanish, then sings with his guitar and, finally, pays a station for early morning airtime. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> and his wife sold advertising on the show, making a profit on the difference. Called `` Los Madrugadores'' -LRB- `` The Early Risers'' -RRB-, the Los Angeles-based program developed a strong following among Hispanics with a mix of live music, discussion of issues and commercials. Now 94, <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> lives with his wife, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and was a consultant for the film, said <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Artenstein </PERSON>, who wrote and directed the movie. To insure realism, <PERSON> Artenstein </PERSON> used both Spanish and English dialogue. `` You ca n't have <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> talking and singing in English if you say he was the first -LRB- radio broadcaster -RRB- in Spanish,'' said <PERSON> Artenstein </PERSON>. But the bilingual approach can pose distribution problems. <PERSON> Eberhard </PERSON> said exhibitors are shying away from the film because they do n't know whether to market it as an English or Spanish movie. `` It's scary for the distributors because of the natural language flow,'' she said. Though he changed some characters' names, <PERSON> Artenstein </PERSON> said that all of the film's main roles are based on real people, including an activist <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> consul, a district attorney who helps frame <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, and a teen-age girl who falsely accuses <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> of raping her. Courtroom testimony in the film is taken from <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>' trial transcripts unearthed by a law library archivist. <PERSON> Artenstein </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>' Spanish-language daily, La Opinion, also had extensive coverage of <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>' case, but the English-language media did not have one story. `` Break of <PERSON> Dawn </PERSON>,'' which was shot for $ 850,000, also stars <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Rojo </PERSON> as <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>' wife. Others in the film include <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Plana </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pepe </PERSON> <PERSON> Serna </PERSON>, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kamala </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, <PERSON> Valarie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wildman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Socorro </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON>. The film was independently produced by San Diego-based <ORGANIZATION> Cinewest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productions </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> is now the nation's largest Hispanic media market, with $ 32.7 million spent on Spanish-language radio advertising in 1988, according to Hispanic Business magazine. Seven radio stations and two television stations now air Spanish broadcasts full time in the city. It is a far cry from the days when <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> and his wife had to pay stations in advance for pre-dawn airtime.

<TEXT>
 The book they're throwing at <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> is more than twice as long as the one that got the speaker of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> into trouble in the first place. It's a government-tan paperback with the uninviting title `` Report of the Special Outside Counsel in the Matter of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, Jr.'' and it runs 279 pages. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s lucrative `` Reflections of a Public Man'' was 117 pages, a lightweight by comparison but a moneymaker. It made <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> $ 54,642.25 in what the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Ethics <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> charges were actually disguised honorarium payments that violated <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> limits. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> says he never considered the book purchases to be speech payments. But the report recounts 11 cases in which the speaker, up against <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> limits on honoraria, made appearances before groups ranging from the fertilizer industry to cranberry growers who then bought books instead of paying speech fees. His so-called royalty was 55 percent, $ 3.25 a copy on a book that was priced at $ 5.95. According to the report, some of the interests that paid for books did n't bother to take any. The speaker would have been better off if he'd quit the book business after one of his earlier works was published, even though it did n't do nearly as well financially. The title of that one: `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and Conscience.'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, outside counsel to the ethics committee, put together the <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> report, accusing the speaker of 116 violations of House rules. The committee voted to charge <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> with 69 of them, shelving the other 47. The <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> report covers them all. The accusations the committee voted to pursue center on the book deal and on gifts and benefits <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> received from his friend and business associate, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> businessman. But some of the most striking sections of the <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> report cover alleged violations the committee is not pressing, involving <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s interventions with federal savings and loan regulators in behalf of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> interests, among friends and political fundraisers. That happened early in the savings and loan crisis that now carries a price tag estimate at $ 126 billion over the next decade. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s early involvement, in 1986, delayed action that might have started the government dealing with the process. Republicans contend the cost of solving the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L crisis would have been cut by half if the government had started closing down insolvent institutions and paying off insured depositors two years earlier. But the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> did n't have the money to do it <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, then majority leader, delayed <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> action on a bill to provide it while he pressed with <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L regulators about their dealings with a <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L operator. <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, was said to figure that the only way to get the action on bill his agenda needed was to do what <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> wanted. So he changed supervisors at an <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L that was under board control. The <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> report likened that to blackmail. The S & amp; L bill was stalled for a week. It passed the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, but did n't make it through the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> adjourned. Legislation to replenish the insurance fund did n't become law until August, 1987. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> also intervened in behalf of <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaubert </PERSON>, ousted by federal regulators as chairman of an insolvent S & amp; L, and barred from getting back into the business under an agreement he had made with the bank board. <PERSON> Gaubert </PERSON>, who was treasurer of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said he had been unfairly pressured into accepting the agreement, and wanted it rescinded. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> called <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>. Eventually, the bank board chairman named a special counsel to review handling of the <PERSON> Gaubert </PERSON> case, even though he told the ethics committee he had no reason to doubt the original handling. The bank board still did n't have it's recapitalization bill. `` ... We had to have passage of the legislation and I had ... <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> making it clear that I was to talk to his friend, his buddy,'' <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said. Soon after that, in November, 1986, <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> got another call from <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, this one to complain more generally about the way S & amp; Ls were being treated in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. In that call, <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> testified, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said that a top <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> regulator for the bank board was a homosexual who `` had established a ring of homosexual lawyers in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> at various law firms'' and was forcing people to deal with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> through those lawyers. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> asked him to get rid of the man. `` And I said, ` No. I was the one who recruited him. I think very highly of him. He is doing what I want him to do.''' While <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> recommended that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> be charged with rules violations in the S & amp; L cases, a divided committee did n't do so. That probably reflects legislators' sensitivity about their own, presumably more restrained interventions with executive agencies in behalf of constituents. It is part of the job. And as <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> noted, there is no House rule expressly defining undue influence.

<HEAD>A Stock List From Main Street</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Stock lists are forever offered from Wall Street, one of the reasons being that Wall Street and its institutions and brokers have an increasingly shorter time horizon and an ever-changing focus. Here's a list that's different. It's from Main Street, prepared by serious amateurs who believe in fundamental analysis rather than hunches, and long-term investing rather than short-term trading. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has just released its Top 100 stocks, which it says is made up of the most widely held companies among individual investors and investment clubs around the country. Heading the list are <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> PepsiCo </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION>, four of which were also in the top five a year ago. The newcomer, <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, jumped from 16th place. Advancing the furthest, suggesting individual and club investors believe the shares have good long-term futures, were <ORGANIZATION> Rollins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION>, from 80 to 34; <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION>, from 92 to 51; and <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>, at 31 a newcomer to the list. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Janke </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NAIC </ORGANIZATION> president, observes that while the market's horizon seems to be getting shorter and its turnover greater, and that many stocks seem to be chosen because of publicity, the <ORGANIZATION> NAIC </ORGANIZATION>'s membership sticks to long-term Fundamental to its investment concept is that company performance should be studied thoroughly before any commitment is made, and that the investment should be made primarily in companies growing more rapidly than the economy. In operating a portfolio, it believes that regular investments, even if in small amounts, are necessary in order to offset the unpredictable ups and downs of the market, and that dividends should be reinvested. The effectiveness of that approach has been demonstrated in learned theses and simple comparisons, but most effectively in the lives of club members who have paid tuitions, bought homes, taken trips and retired on their investments. <PERSON> Janke </PERSON> said a review of 1,600 responses _ <ORGANIZATION> NAIC </ORGANIZATION> has 135,000 members _ identified at least two significant trends about individual investing habits. First, he said, amateur and individual investors are taking their investing even more seriously than in the past, placing more emphasis on facts and fundamentals rather than on hearsay or gossip. A developing trend, according to <PERSON> Janke </PERSON>, is the growing use of dividend reinvestment plans to help build club holdings and keep commission costs low. More than one-quarter of clubs appeared to be using such plans, he said. Close to a thousand companies offer reinvestment plans, in which dividends are transferred to the shareholder's account with the company. In addition, most plans allow additional monthly or quarterly amounts to be sent directly to the company, thereby eliminating or greatly reducing brokerage costs. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> NAIC </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, comments that the disciplined, fundamentalist, long-term perspective of members is often made difficult by the media and professional and institutional investors. He claims the media and professional investors, whom he described as `` the herd on the street'' and the `` flock on the block,'' promote the notion of in-out trading and distract from fundamental considerations. `` Wall Street changes its opinion on stocks many times more often than the real long-term fundamentals of the underlying companies change,'' he said in an analysis of the Top 100 in `` Better Investing,'' <ORGANIZATION> NAIC </ORGANIZATION>'s monthly magazine. Copies of the report are available at $ 2 from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, 1515 <ORGANIZATION> E. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eleven </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Road </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oak </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION> 48067. Annual membership of $ 31 includes the magazine and the <ORGANIZATION> NAIC </ORGANIZATION> Investors Manual.

 In the temporary <ORGANIZATION> Navajo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> office, one clock runs five minutes faster than another a few feet away, an unintended symbol of a government thrown out of sync by the alleged corruption of its chairman. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>, who had held the highest office of the 200,000-member tribe with one interruption since 1971, was voted out by the tribal council in February following allegations that he demanded kickbacks. The 60-year-old <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>, who says he's innocent, has lived for years like a potentate in plain view of Indians whose austere circumstances are proverbial. And yet while he rode in limousines and flew to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and the Super Bowl, he also promised economic development _ a vision of herdsmen becoming technicians. After spending $ 650,000 to remodel his offices following his January 1987 inauguration, <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> was secure in his fourth term until January when the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Indian Affairs began investigating corruption in tribal governments. Witness after witness told of <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> demanding kickbacks. His son, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> `` Rocky'' <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, testified after receiving immunity from prosecution, using a code term in speaking of under-the-table payments to his father as `` golf balls.'' When the 88-member <ORGANIZATION> Tribal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> began its winter meeting in early February, it rebelled. On Feb. 17, a Friday night after many <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> supporters had left, the dissidents voted 49-13 to place him and Vice Chairman <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> on administrative leave. The majority picked <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Haskie </PERSON> as interim chairman on March 10 and has stood united since, giving rise to th name `` 49ers.'' `` The joke around here is that it's the 49ers versus the Stealers,'' said <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chinle </LOCATION>. Past Navajo leaders `` usually were very wealthy men, but I would n't say they compare to <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Duane </PERSON> <PERSON> Beyal </PERSON>, <PERSON> Haskie </PERSON>'s press secretary and chief assistant to former chairman <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> <PERSON> Zah </PERSON>. `` With them, they were counting herds of sheep; with <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>, it's the green stuff.'' In visits to some of the 109 reservation chapters, or wards, <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> has maintained his innocence. He has refused repeated <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> requests for interviews and declined to respond in writing to a list of questions. Although the <ORGANIZATION> Navajo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> upheld the council action, <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> refused to stop giving orders or vacate what <PERSON> Haskie </PERSON> calls `` the Mahogany Palace'' wing of the administration building. `` I am innocent. And I am entitled under the law to be presumed innocent. But the <ORGANIZATION> Tribal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> could care less,'' <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> wrote in an opinion piece for the Gallup -LRB- <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION> -RRB- Independent. He has acknowledged taking `` gifts'' from contractors but argues gift exchanges are a time-honored way of doing business by Indian chiefs. To <PERSON> Haskie </PERSON>, that's a distortion of Indian tradition. `` Those gifts were tokens to establish a longterm friendship with an individual, not hundreds of thousands of dollars but small things _ bracelets, moccasins, a shawl,'' <PERSON> Haskie </PERSON> said. No one knows how much <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> realized from the tribe's 1987 purchase of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boquillas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ranch </ORGANIZATION>, a 491,000-acre spread in north-central <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> real estate broker <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> `` Bud'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> testified that he arranged for a <LOCATION> Scottsdale </LOCATION> oilman to buy the ranch for $ 26.2 million and sell it a few hours later to the Navajos for $ 33.4 million. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said he gave <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> $ 50,000 in cash and the use of a BMW sedan, along with paying off a $ 25,000 loan; dissidents claim <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> may have received one-tenth of the profit. A federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> is investigating the allegations. In 1975, <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> was indicted on fraud and income-tax-evasion charges. A deadlocked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court jury in May 1977 failed to reach a verdict, and the judge ordered a directed verdict of acquittal. The longtime tribal leader is not without defenders. `` Mr. <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> is a very strong statesman for Indian people across the country,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Benally </PERSON>, chairman of the council's <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> until <PERSON> Haskie </PERSON> named a new panel. `` I think we would have really made a big stride in our economic development if Mr. <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> would've gone on without any political interruptions.'' <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>, an electrical engineer, worked in the aerospace industry in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> before he returned to the reservation, where people still live in traditional, five-sided, log-and-mud hogans tucked into remote canyons or squatting atop wind-swept mesas. The native of Teec Nos Pos, a tiny community less than five miles from both <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in the Four Corners heartland of Navajo tradition, served three terms as chairman before <PERSON> Zah </PERSON> won the 1982 election. Four years later, <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> defeated <PERSON> Zah </PERSON> by about 750 votes out of 61,000 cast. <PERSON> Haskie </PERSON> said he does n't know whether he'll run for the $ 55,000-a-year position in 1990. He added that he expects the chairmanship to have less power when he leaves office. `` I never sought this job; it just happened so fast,'' said the 43-year-old civil engineer. <PERSON> Haskie </PERSON> has persuaded the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> that he is legally in charge. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> BIA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Navajo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> director, said courts had upheld the council majority's action despite <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>'s claim that a two-thirds majority was needed to remove him from office. Noting that <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> had decided to honor <PERSON> Haskie </PERSON>'s signature on checks, <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> strengthened <PERSON> Haskie </PERSON>'s hand on April 6 by empowering him to allocate contracts controlling $ 91 million in federal funds for such purposes as <LOCATION> Navajo </LOCATION> police work, forest management, fire and judicial services. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carlos </LOCATION> Apache who grew up in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, views the council's action as a legal housecleaning, but <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> has claimed that the <ORGANIZATION> BIA </ORGANIZATION> is trying to undermine tribal sovereignty. `` This happens in foreign countries, not the <LOCATION> Navajo </LOCATION> nation,'' said council delegate <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> <PERSON> Tully </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Teesto </LOCATION>. `` They are copying communistic countries.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapela </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Window </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> attorney who claims to have gathered 37,000 signatures in a drive to recall <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>, has visited about 25 chapters to show the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> videotapes. `` Mr. <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> is his own downfall,'' said <PERSON> Chapela </PERSON>, whom <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> has fired from three tribal positions. He said <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> is `` our best salesman of the need for a constitution'' that would ensure accountability and spell out procedures for removing leaders. <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> rejects a constitution as `` an Anglo form of government.'' And <PERSON> Haskie </PERSON> said tailoring a constitution to tribal needs would `` require extensive discussion, debates and public hearings.'' Meanwhile, the uncertainty continues. <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, director of the Navajo ethics office, said she believes many people remain neutral about <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>, with few recognizing <PERSON> Haskie </PERSON> as a legitimate successor. `` I think there should be a new election for chairman,'' she said.

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ Torture is an ancient practice, but the science of rehabilitating its victims has just started receiving serious attention in the past few years. This nation's most ambitious effort at treating the victims' psychological as well as physical wounds has been undertaken at a private non-profit clinic in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>.

 At a clinic in a small stucco house near the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION>, doctors make a point of wearing street clothes instead of white coats, and patient files are stored in a bank vault. Medical instruments are kept out of sight, along with scissors and other sharp objects. A psychologist may counsel a patient one day and take him to the dentist the next; the whine of a drill or sight of a needle can cause terror. This is a story about people whose personalities have been taken apart, piece by piece, and the people who try to put them back together. The stucco house with its mismatched furniture, colorful artwork and donated plants is the Center for Victims of Torture, the nation's most ambitious attempt to rehabilitate torture survivors. The psychologists, doctors and others who work here face a distinct disadvantage: Torture is ancient, but this is a science still inventing itself. `` We are designing the car while riding in it,'' <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Valerian </PERSON> says. Though still a long way from the research, training, treatment and education institute envisioned by a governor's task force, the private, non-profit center already is looked to for leadership by a dozen groups trying to launch similar programs in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>. In June, representatives of each group will travel to <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> for four days of workshops. The conference will focus on treatment of trauma because medical research on torture survivors has yet to be done. The 10 doctors, psychiatrists, psychologists and social workers at the <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> outpatient clinic have borrowed from the treatment of rape victims, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans and others. Executive director <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> thinks torture victims are more profoundly damaged by their experience. `` If you were raped or mugged, you would still have some hope of rescue,'' he says. `` But being tortured by your government means losing all recourse. There's a sense of abandonment to evil.'' Nearly three-fourths of the center's clients suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, the disease of combat soldiers, rape victims and earthquake survivors. Symptoms include nightmares, flashbacks, loss of memory, inability to concentrate, and uncontrollable outbursts of anger. In the beginning, client assessments were kept to a minimum, for fear that too many questions would trigger memories of interrogation. `` For most people though, we've found the process was actually comforting,'' says <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, whose staff has begun compiling information as a prelude to serious research. The center also is raising money to renovate a much larger building the state is donating to enable the program to expand. So far, 147 survivors and their relatives have been treated at the center. They have come from 21 countries, including <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. Eventually, the center hopes to treat 100 a year. Nearly all now live in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. With its myriad church and state refugee programs, the state has the highest per capita refugee population in the nation: 39,000 out of 6 million residents, not counting Central American and other illegal aliens. All told, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> thinks there could be as many as 6,000 torture survivors among them. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> could have 50,000 or more, he says. <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>'s clinic, established with the help of Gov. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> in 1985, is one of two full-service torture-treatment facilities in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Marjorie </PERSON> <PERSON> Kovler </PERSON> <PERSON> Center </PERSON> for the Treatment of Survivors of Torture opened in 1987, five years after <LOCATION> Copenhagen </LOCATION> established the first center. Others are operating in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. Typically, anywhere from one to 10 years pass before a client finds his way to <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> for treatment. The physical evidence may be long gone, but the invisible, psychic wounds have yet to heal. The victims' initial interview with <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Chester </PERSON>, the clinical director, may mark the first time they have ever discussed their experience. Some have trouble remembering; others can bring themselves to speak of it only in the third person, relaying tales of horror that happened to `` others.'' `` It's hard for a nation of Donahue-watchers to understand the reticence of torture survivors,'' says <PERSON> Chester </PERSON>, a psychologist. `` In the Third World, life is much more personal. Some things are simply not talked about.'' Women who were sexually abused by their captors may view themselves as pariahs, she says. `` There's also the stigma that you must have told them something, you must have joined the enemy, to be still alive.'' Torture victims may not see the connection between the beatings of three years ago and the anxieties of today. But such delays are n't unusual. `` You're so busy surviving, it may not be until you rest for a moment that this comes out,'' <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> says. Center physician <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Holtan </PERSON> has learned not to mince words: `` I may ask point-blank if they've ever been tortured.'' Often, even when the answer is yes, the response is an unequivocal no. In some of the world's prisons, he says, `` it's considered normal to be beaten up every day.'' When the long-repressed symptoms do surface, the most mundane encounters, the most common objects, can cause panic. `` A knock on the door, a ring of a bell, the turning on of a light bulb can trigger bad memories,'' says <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> law professor <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Weissbrodt </PERSON>, a board member of both <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> and the center. Center staffers wear street clothes because many clients are afraid of uniforms. `` Even the sight of a mailman can upset them,'' <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> says. For clients' protection, files are stored in a bank vault. For their comfort, the stucco house is unmarked. And when the center opened, four <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks ceremoniously chased evil spirits out of each room. Psychologist <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia-Peltoniemi </PERSON> and her colleagues probe gently. `` We are careful not to play the role of interrogator, and we watch out for anything institutional in the atmosphere of the place.'' She looks at her donated office furniture and sighs. `` I worry that my chairs are too drab.'' <PERSON> Garcia-Peltoniemi </PERSON>, who came to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> as a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> refugee in 1970, is especially attuned to her clients' adjustment problems. In their native countries, they may have been students, professionals or tribesmen. In <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, they lose those identities. `` Refugees in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> are also exposed to more risk than the average person,'' she says. `` They may live in poor neighborhoods with drugs, crime, assaults. For refugees who've been traumatized, another incident can have a powerful effect.''

 For those kept alive by the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream, the reality can be daunting. `` They may feel angry at the political asylum process,'' says <PERSON> Chester </PERSON>. `` They may feel that Americans should know what's happened There's very little recognition of their terrible grief and loss.'' <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> defines torture as `` the deliberate, systematic or wanton infliction of physical or mental suffering by one or more persons acting alone or on the orders of any authority to force another person to yield information, to make a confession, or for any other reason.'' Reports of torture have surfaced in 90 countries, according to <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, the worldwide human rights organization. By its count, torture is systematic in 30 countries, a serious problem in another 30. Historians have tracked the institutionalization of torture to the Greeks and the Romans, who used it to extract confessions from slaves. Torture spread through the criminal justice system. Eventually it was used against citizens as well as slaves. The pattern has stayed consistent through the ages, <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> says. `` A small group of disenfranchised people are tortured for state security reasons. It begins there, but it does n't end there. Invariably, torture spreads.'' The notion of torture as truth serum has long since been disproved; extreme pain is likely to elicit whatever a torturer wants to hear. But information is n't necessarily the objective, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> says. `` The real purpose of torture is to dismantle the personality, leaving an empty husk. It is to leave the person ineffective, afraid to act, unable to lead, a warning to the rest of the community.'' To those ends, it is chillingly effective, he says. `` No one can withstand modern torture.'' Torture victims may be forced to witness mock executions; to watch loved ones being tortured; to swallow or inject massive doses of drugs that carry terrible side effects; to breathe water _ or worse. Overstimulation and sensory deprivation are common: intermittent, uncontrollable blasts of noise piped into cells; hooded prisoners made to stand naked in brightly lit cells for interminable periods; cells flooded with cold water, making sleep impossible. Frequent cell changes heighten helplessness. `` Imagine how you would feel if every time you came home the furniture was moved and there were new people living in your house,'' says <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Rengel </PERSON>, chief legislative counsel for <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International-U.S. </ORGANIZATION> `` People become totally insecure _ there's no feeling of control.'' Disorientation, overstimulation and sensory deprivation are among the hard-to-detect, psychological methods that are replacing the blunt-force trauma of the past. One reason for the change is the world's heightened awareness of human rights abuses. Another is the heightened awareness of the workings of the human mind. `` Since we know so much more about the psychology of the human being,'' <PERSON> Rengel </PERSON> says, `` it opens the door to people who want to do other than good.'' A decade ago, it was possible to identify the country responsible on the basis of a victim's injuries. Today's methods are more uniform. `` You do n't need to be in a highly sophisticated setting to use electricity to torture people,'' says <PERSON> Rengel </PERSON>. Even in remote areas, she says, `` people can charge up a field battery and take it along.'' In some cases, electric shock is administered under a doctor's supervision `` There's evidence of health professionals' involvement in <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> says `` In <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, there's evidence that doctors and psychologists are involved in designing prisons to keep people disoriented.'' Some techniques are more subtle _ and more devastating. One woman was made to choose between two forms of torture, thereby becoming a participant. Often, a torturer persuades a victim that following certain rules will result in rewards, such as a visit from relatives, or an extra ration of food. But the rules change constantly. `` They want you to think you have some control. But you can never figure out the magic words,'' says <PERSON> Valerian </PERSON>, who has testified at immigration hearings as an expert witness on human rights abuses. After weeks, months or years, the ordeal is over. Freedom is restored, often as capriciously as it was taken away. Some survivors manage to slip out of the country. `` The escapes in many cases are as dangerous as the imprisonment,'' <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> says. Nearly 80 percent of the center's clients find work, although `` most people wind up with survival jobs,'' says <PERSON> Leigh </PERSON> <PERSON> Bristol-Kagan </PERSON>, a social worker. She says some are highly indecisive, a holdover from imprisonment, when wrong decisions held weighty consequences. Low tolerance for stress is common, as are troubled relationships within suvivors' families. Problems with immigration judges are common. `` Because they have divorced themselves from their emotions, clients have gone in and in great detail, related what happened to them in a monotone,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> says. `` The judge does n't believe them.'' The center often calls upon the <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> Lawyers Project, a sister organization, for help. About 30 percent of the clients are on anti-depressants. Many are plagued by real or imagined pains, crying spells and feelings of hopelessness, panic, guilt and shame. Also common is `` psychic numbing,'' a sense of detachment from others and an inability to experience pleasure. `` We think strong people tend to drive deep in themselves and protect some part of themselves, to wall it off, divorce themselves from their bodies, in terms of joy and relaxation as well as pain,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> says. `` If their sexuality or their emotions are being used against them, they divorce themselves from that. It gets them through, but when the torture is over, that part of them remains dysfunctional.'' The <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> clinic has a budget of $ 350,000 this year, compared to $ 195,000 in 1988. The money comes from foundation grants and private donations; clients pay no fees for their treatment. Some seek only medical care, others request long-term treatment. Invariably, things get worse before they get better; how much better remains to be seen. `` We dramatically help a few patients and miserably fail a few,'' Holtan says. `` Most fall into the middle ground.'' Still, the mood at the center is hopeful. Torture victims who seek treatment tend to be intelligent and motivated, staff members say. `` What we see here are the survivors,'' says <PERSON> Chester </PERSON>. `` We are constantly amazed.''

 Transforming an ordinary citizen into a skilled torturer is easier than one might think, says a longtime <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> volunteer. <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Valerian </PERSON>, who is also a fund-raiser and coordinator of volunteers for <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Victims </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Torture </ORGANIZATION>, has testified at immigration hearings as an expert witness on human rights abuses. She gained some of her insights from a former Salvadoran torturer, whom she interviewed at length. <PERSON> Valerian </PERSON> remembers him as `` charming and likable. He was most concerned that I would be upset by what he had to say.'' The torturer, who'd escaped to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, agreed to be interviewed to clear his conscience, she says. His recruiters used a common technique. `` Part of the training involved propaganda induction sessions,'' <PERSON> Valerian </PERSON> says. `` He'd been told that World War III had started Communists were secretly infiltrating the country, using it as a beachhead to take over the Western world. `` It was imperative that he be made to believe these people were holding the fate of the Western world in their hands.'' In reality, the victims had been chosen at random, <PERSON> Valerian </PERSON> says. `` He saw elderly men, pregnant women and kids. Still, he had no idea they were n't communists.'' As part of his indoctrination, the torturer was himself tortured. `` The torturers are often beaten three times a day, sexually humiliated and punished arbitrarily,'' <PERSON> Valerian </PERSON> says. `` This normalization of violence is the key. The training lasts nine months. This man from the back of his waist to his knees was one giant callus from canings with broom handles.'' At the same time new recruits are being beaten, <PERSON> Valerian </PERSON> says, `` they're taught that they're the ones who are informed as to what's really going on. They're the elite. `` There are people who do enjoy it. There's the power. The perks. The promise of a job for life. They're given cars. And they're paid very well, with liquor and drugs for the asking. A lot of the torture is done under the influence.'' The Salvadoran came from a family of 14 in a rural area. `` They were very poor and always hungry,'' <PERSON> Valerian </PERSON> says. For a time, he did all that was asked of him. `` He finally began to wonder when one of his superiors told him to cut the head off the body of someone they'd murdered and place it on his body as a warning to others,'' <PERSON> Valerian </PERSON> says. `` He could n't do it. He could n't bring himself to mutilate a dead body.'' Then he saw a commanding officer cut the finger off a corpse _ he wanted the dead man's ring. `` He said, ` That's crazy. We're acting like animals.''' <PERSON> Valerian </PERSON> says. `` He escaped the next day.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ From <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> westward to <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> lie the remains of more than 2,300 Americans listed as missing in action since the war ended 14 years ago. Now the communist government has opened the doors wide for Americans to come in and search for their dead, apparently in hopes that more cooperation with the West will lead to more sorely needed economic aid. The third of three articles.

<TEXT>
 On that day in 1967 when the skies filled with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warplanes raining bombs, a former North Vietnamese militiaman remembers burying an American airman who was shot down in a rice paddy. On a recent spring day, <PERSON> Bui </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Lai </PERSON>, now 52, along with 10 other Vietnamese men and a group of Americans, were digging for the remains of the missing flier on the land that is now a cornfield grazed by water buffalo. In <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s paddies and peaceful fields sprinkled with violets, in the foreboding triple-canopy jungles, in the chilling waters of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> westward to <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, lie the remains of more than 2,300 other Americans also listed as missing in action. For 431 of the missing, their final resting place is apparently at sea, off the coast of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, more than half of them from <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> carriers. An 82-day undersea recovery operation using divers and special barges 16 years ago was unsuccessful, although some wreckage was found. Now, after more than a decade of basking in a bittersweet victory in self-imposed isolation, communist <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> is welcoming Americans back in increasing numbers to search for their fallen comrades, and even joining them in their effort. What <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> wants in return is badly needed <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> aid for a country that won the war but could n't manage the peace. Even <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s top official for MIAs, <ORGANIZATION> Nguyen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Can </ORGANIZATION>, accompanies the joint U.S.-Vietnamese excavation team as <PERSON> Bui </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Lai </PERSON> leads them through the mud of <LOCATION> Ha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Son </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Binh </LOCATION>, a wilderness 45 miles west of <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>. Farmers who once were victims of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air attacks gather in curiosity around the searchers as they map the plot of land where the American pilot is believed buried. <PERSON> Quach </PERSON> <PERSON> Thuc </PERSON>, 68, her teeth rotten from Vietnamese chewing tobacco, points to the sky. `` I saw the crash,'' she says. `` I did n't want to look. I ran away.'' The second crewman in the plane was captured, spent six years in a prison camp, and was freed by <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> along with 590 other Americans during `` Operation Homecoming'' in 1973. Today, the Americans come armed not with laser bombs, but with compasses, tape measures, trowels, dental picks and whisk brooms, the tools of the archaeologist. Their mission is to preserve the skeletal remains for their journey home. Each bone is measured, its position sketched and photographed and then reassembled in a lab, just the way it was found, for identification. `` I want the whole bone because I can make the best, most scientific statement,'' says <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a forensic anthropologist and archaeologist with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Central Identification Laboratory in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. `` If there are teeth in that jaw, that jaw is going to be fragile. Therefore, I'd better be careful how I dig it out because I want the dentist back in the lab to have a whole set of teeth.'' The laboratory has a computerized data base on every tooth of every missing American who fought in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, so if the teeth are recovered they can be matched with the X-rays. The Joint Casualty Resolution Center in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, which searches for MIAs, has all of the information on the crash, including the site and names of the missing airmen, based on eyewitness reports of other pilots and on informants such as <PERSON> Bui </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Lai </PERSON>. From bone fragments alone, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> can determine the race, sex and age of the victim. But on this day and the next, the searchers are unable to find the American remains, even though they uncovered some pieces of wreckage. Time has altered the terrain and played tricks with <PERSON> Bui </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Lai </PERSON>'s memory. The searchers must move on, but <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> hopes to try again another time. While other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Vietnamese search teams crisscross the countryside in U.S.-made vans, the families back home keep alive their last link to the lost. Some 3,600 of them belong to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Families </ORGANIZATION>, which was founded in 1970 to push for the return of any Americans still alive, the fullest possible accounting of those still missing and the repatriation of remains. `` The league's position is that Americans are still held, a policy based on history of the issue, known discrepancy cases and the intelligence information which supports our view,'' says <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffiths </PERSON>, executive director of the league, who has a brother among the MIAs. `` The vast majority of family members believe Americans are alive,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Griffiths </PERSON> says. `` They do n't necessarily personalize it for themselves, saying ` I believe my husband's alive.' They say, ` I believe Americans are alive. I'm not sure about my own relatives.''' For many families, the mental torture never ends until the fallen are buried. `` It is a human trait to hope that individual is alive unless you have some indication that man is dead,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Griffiths </PERSON> says. `` Even though it's sad to lose someone you love, if he's buried with military honors, it's done with for you. It's over.'' All of the MIAs except one, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Col. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelton </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Owensboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, have been legally declared dead, so the family can collect benefits. Just under half the MIAs were declared killed at the time of the battle, based on eyewitness reports, but heavy fire or other circumstances prevented recovery of their remains. <PERSON> Shelton </PERSON> was shot down in the mountains of <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> on his 33rd birthday 24 years ago. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rescuers contacted him by radio on the ground and he indicated he was in good condition. Villagers and defectors told authorities he was taken prisoner by communist Laotian forces. <PERSON> Shelton </PERSON> is among the so-called `` discrepancy cases,'' in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, in which some Americans were alive when last seen and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has reason to believe they were taken into captivity or turned over to communist authorities.

<HEAD>HA SON BINH, Vietnam: communist authorities.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Over the years, <PERSON> Shelton </PERSON> has been promoted from captain to colonel, his wife, <PERSON> Marian </PERSON>, has turned 55, and his five children have grown up, including one son who was ordained a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> priest. While authorities say his official status as <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s only POW in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> is symbolic of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> determination to make sure every MIA is accounted for, his wife believes he is still alive and waits for his return, cherishing the memory of their first meeting on the tennis courts in <LOCATION> Owensboro </LOCATION> when she was 13 and he was 14. `` I think God gives all of us a cross to bear,'' says Mrs. <PERSON> Shelton </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has repeatedly denied it is holding live American prisoners or is storing in morgues the remains of MIAs, returning them when it suits its political purposes. `` We have not been able to prove anyone is still alive, but given the information we continue to receive, we can not rule out or ignore that possibility, so we are going to continue to pursue the issue,'' says Lt. Col. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Pentagon. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has received more than 1,100 firsthand reports of sightings of live Americans. In 63 percent of the cases, <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> says, the Americans had been in <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION> but had returned home and are not missing in action. Twenty-one percent were fabrications. The other 16 percent are under continuing investigation. Can says some Vietnamese people have been giving out false information on POWs and trafficking in <ORGANIZATION> MIA </ORGANIZATION> remains by digging up Vietnamese graves and trying to pass them off as the remains of Americans in the mistaken belief that they will be rewarded with entry into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` What good is it for us to keep one or two American MIA prisoners?'' asks Can. `` What good is it for us to hold remains if we return to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> nearly 600 POWs. Living prisoners of war are much more valuable if we choose to use them as leverage.'' <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Griffiths </PERSON> both say that since retired Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s emissary, held high-level talks with the Vietnamese in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> in August 1987, there has been increased cooperation. That is evident in the field, where <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has allowed more American searchers to come in, including forensic anthropologists. But still there is a long way to go. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> have turned over the remains of fewer than 300 Americans. No remains have been returned from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, where 83 Americans are listed as missing. Like <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has no diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, whose government is under the control of the Vietnamese. Can says the Vietnamese have been trying to settle the issue as fast as they can. But <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s speed depends on the cooperation the <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON> mission pledged in helping the country obtain humanitarian aid from non-government organizations for disabled veterans and children. `` On their part,'' Can says, `` they will have to help us in solving the humanitarian concerns of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>.'' By law, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is forbidden to give <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> any financial or material assistance. But it does contribute indirectly by keeping non-government charitable organizations informed of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s needs and by making it easier for the organizations to satisfy complicated regulations in sending goods and people to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. For the families of the missing, the vigil is never ending. Some of their children are now older than their fathers were when they were lost. One family, <PERSON> Rosella </PERSON> and <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitts </PERSON>, have stayed close to their home in <LOCATION> Abington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, for nearly 20 years except to attend meetings of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Families </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, and to speak in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> to keep alive the MIA-POW issue. `` We have n't been out socially in over 18 years,'' says <PERSON> Fitts </PERSON>, a 66-year-old bulldozer operator. `` We never go anywhere. I'm afraid a phone call will come or a car will come in the driveway with some information.'' The Fittses' son, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beret </ORGANIZATION> sergeant, has been missing since Nov. 30, 1968. He was only 21 at the time, married and a father. Now his only son is 22, older than his father was when he was reported missing. His wife did n't remarry until a year ago In March, the call the <PERSON> Fitts </PERSON> had waited for came. Military officials told Mrs. <PERSON> Fitts </PERSON> that a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> excavation team had uncovered an undetermined number of human remains at a site in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> where a helicopter believed carrying her son and six other military men had crashed in November 1968. The remains have been sent to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Central Identification Laboratory. But <PERSON> Marian </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rosella </PERSON> and <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitts </PERSON>, and others like them resist the finality of death. `` I've had that feeling right from the beginning that he was alive,'' says Mrs. <PERSON> Fitts </PERSON>. `` I just ca n't get rid of that feeling. I had a dream of seeing him in a cave alive way back.'' <PERSON> Fitts </PERSON> says he had hopes his son was alive and suspected he was being held in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> by the communist Laotian government. `` They're not dashed,'' he says `` We play the waiting game again.'' Even if the Central Identification Laboratory confirms the remains are those of his son, <PERSON> Fitts </PERSON> says, he would get a second independent opinion. `` I would hate to give up and then have him walk up the driveway.'' <PERSON> Fitts </PERSON> clings to the green beret his son sent him for Father's Day in 1968, shortly before he left for <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, and to an accompanying letter on a piece of yellow lined paper `` ... When you hold that beret in your hands, you hold me because we are part of each other ... Please take care if it, Dad ... Treat it like your own son, <PERSON> Dad </PERSON>, because, believe it or not, the beret you hold in front of you is your son.'' Every morning and every evening, the Fittses hold the beret in their hands. `` The minute you pick it up, you just feel him, that he's right there,'' says Mrs. <PERSON> Fitts </PERSON>.

 Hollywood of late has been preoccupied with reliving the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war, but at least one of the central players in that controversial conflict says he has n't been the least bit interested in reviewing any celluloid versions of those turbulent times. `` I was there,'' says <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Cao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ky. </PERSON> `` I know what happened.'' Ky, who was prime minister of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in the mid-1960s, made this observation recently in an interview at his seafood packing plant next to the dark, sluggish waters of Bayou Caillou. It is in this remote little Cajun community, he says, that he hopes to end an exile odyssey which began nearly 35 years ago, when he and 1 million of his countrymen fled south following <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s defeat at <PERSON> Dien </PERSON> <PERSON> Bien </PERSON> <PERSON> Phu </PERSON> in 1954 `` I grew up in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` When I was 20 I was recruited by the French colonial government to fight the communist insurgents. I began my military career in 1949 as an infantry officer in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and later received flight training in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>.'' Ky's flight to <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION> in 1954 marked the first stop of the odyssey. Two decades later, after losing again to the communists, Ky went into exile for the second time, this time in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Now, he says, he hardly ever thinks about those days, when <PERSON> Ho </PERSON> <PERSON> Chi </PERSON> <PERSON> Minh </PERSON> <PERSON> City </PERSON> was still called <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION> and he was the supreme commander of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. `` I am a Confucian,'' he adds, by way of explanation. `` We believe there are times of joy and times of sadness; what will be, will be. But it's true that I did have absolute power when I was made premier, after <PERSON> Ngo </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinh </PERSON> <PERSON> Diem </PERSON> was forced out in 1965. You may recall there was no congressional body in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> at that time. For more than two years, my word was the absolute law.'' At that time Ky _ who still is slim and young-looking at 59 _ was a dashing young fighter pilot. He favored flashy flight suits, carried a pair of pearl-handled pistols and frequently appeared, thus garbed, in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> news magazine photo layouts. In fact, <PERSON> Ky </PERSON> and his wife, then a glamorous airline hostess who was fond of cowgirl outfits, often were depicted as a `` fun couple'' who were representing our side in an unpleasant little, U.S.-backed adventure that would contain communism in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. History proved otherwise, of course, and <PERSON> Ky </PERSON>'s government since has been given mixed reviews, as has the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> involvement in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. Asked about reports of civil rights abuses during his time as premier, Ky smiles sadly. But the smile quickly disappears when he is asked about rumors he stashed millions of dollars worth of gold and jewels during his tenure as premier. `` My wife and I had only about $ 30,000 when we came to this country in 1975,'' he says. `` And when I left <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, on the day <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION> fell, I took nothing with me except my uniform and the helicopter which I flew to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship. I had managed to get my wife and family on a flight out just two days earlier, while <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Thieu </PERSON>, who had succeeded me as premier in 1967, fled with his family weeks before <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION> fell.'' He adds, `` That is why I am the only South Vietnamese leader today who is able to go freely among our people in exile. They know I was a patriot who fought to the last.'' Author <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON>, whose book on the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war, `` A Bright Shining Lie,'' recently won the Pulitzer Prize, remembers Ky and <PERSON> Thieu </PERSON> as `` corrupt Young Turks'' who rose to power in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> as <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> involvement dramatically increased. Ky flatly denies the characterization. `` I have a clear conscience,'' he says. `` It's true I had power, but I'm proud to be able to say that it did not corrupt me. If I had stolen millions of dollars I could live like a king in this country, but obviously I do n't live like a king. Believe me, I was a soldier fighting for freedom, not a politician interested in power and money.'' Former Gen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Westmoreland </PERSON>, who commanded the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> throughout most of the ` 60s, says he remembers <PERSON> Ky </PERSON> as an honest soldier who was revered by his pilots and officers in the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vietnamese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>.

 `` I saw Ky a few months ago in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, at a reunion of soldiers who fought in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Westmoreland </PERSON> said when contacted recently at his home in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION> `` I always thought of Gen. <PERSON> Ky </PERSON> as a committed military man and it's obvious that the men who served with him still hold him in very high regard.'' <PERSON> Westmoreland </PERSON> concedes he had heard rumors of gold being shipped out of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, but says he never heard of Ky being connected with any such stories. In <PERSON> Dulac </PERSON>, Ky is the president of <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seafood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Processors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The operation consists of a small packing plant which processes shrimp and tuna caught by Vietnamese fishermen. Ky, who moved to <PERSON> Dulac </PERSON> several months ago, leases the processing plant from a bank in nearby <LOCATION> Houma </LOCATION>. His earlier business venture in this country, a small liquor store-delicatessen in <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, ended in bankruptcy. Ky has generally tried to keep a low profile since coming to this country. He says he has gotten some financial support from other Vietnamese here and in turn works in behalf of Vietnamese refugees. `` I have spent most of my time working with and trying to help the Vietnamese people who came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as refugees,'' he says. `` That's why I am in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. I found I like the fishing business and have an opportunity to help my people here and make a living at the same time.'' In 1984, his association with refugee groups led columnist <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> to brand Ky, whose wife and family still live in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, as a leader of Vietnamese criminal elements in this country. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ky </PERSON> had smuggled $ 8 million in gold and jewels from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. `` I was stunned,'' Ky recalls. `` There was absolutely no truth in that column. If there had been the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government would have taken some action by now, do n't you think?'' <PERSON> Ky </PERSON> says he had considered suing <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> for libel but was advised against it by <PERSON> Westmoreland </PERSON>, who participated in an unsuccessful libel suit against <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> several years ago. `` <PERSON> Westmoreland </PERSON> said he found libel suits are hard to prove and you end up spending a lot of money,'' <PERSON> Ky </PERSON> says. Ky has found contentment in <LOCATION> Dulac </LOCATION>, a fishing community 80 miles southwest of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. He says the south <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> climate reminds him of <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, complete with French-speaking natives, mosquitoes and plenty of Vietnamese to socialize with. `` Right now I'm busy trying to make a living with this processing plant and a fishing boat I bought three years ago,'' he says. `` I'm also involved in an effort to form a fishing co-op that would benefit the shrimpers in this area. `` Since I've been here I've tried to help the Vietnamese fishermen with marketing their catches and with personal details such as housing, obtaining proper licenses and insurance and such. I feel I can be a liaison between them and the established community here.'' He also spends part of his time commuting back and forth between <PERSON> Dulac </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, where his youngest daughter recently graduated from law school. `` My five children have made the adjustment very well,'' he says. `` They have become Americanized and my oldest son has married an Italian girl. But, coming to this country has been harder for my wife, who stays in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to be near her children and grandchildren.'' <PERSON> Ky </PERSON> says he enjoys associating with the Vietnamese fishermen, who now comprise 65 percent of the shrimpers in the area. `` They see me, not as a general, but as another fisherman, and as a friend,'' he said. Asked whether he still dreams of returning to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, he replies, `` Yes, sometimes, but I realize it's not possible the way things are now.'' He said his main regret was not coming to this country during the war to promote and explain <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s cause to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people. `` I have found the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people to be very fair and open-minded,'' he says. `` But I had no idea how the American public opinion was turning against the war. I only knew what the generals and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador and the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> were telling me. Back then, to me, they were <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ Since it was built almost two centuries ago, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> has been slathered with at least 39 layers of paint, hiding intricate carving in its stone and causing the stone itself to deteriorate. That plus age, weather and some clumsy restorations efforts in the past have left the president's mansion in bad need of repair. Now they're trying to get this old house spruced up in time for its 200th birthday.

 On a muddy hilltop in <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Palumbo </PERSON> picks his way among the mossy, broken blocks of sandstone that once were part of the nation's Capitol. Brush grows over the weathered pile. A fallen tree blocks his path. With a hammer and a chisel, <PERSON> Palumbo </PERSON> breaks off a sample from one stone, then shakes his head and turns away. He tries another, this time marking it with a bold splash of orange dye. This stone will now become part of the White House. <PERSON> Palumbo </PERSON>'s work this day is one step in the complicated process of restoring the stones of the presidential mansion, some of them intricately carved, to their original glory in time for the White House bicentennial in 1992. The $ 2.4 million project includes the removal of at least 39 accumulated layers of paint that have been slathered onto the building over almost two centuries. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which maintains the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and its grounds, awarded the contract to <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Restoration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Overseeing the work as technical adviser is <PERSON> Palumbo </PERSON>, master carver of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cathedral </LOCATION>, the seat of the capital diocese of the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and one of the city's landmarks. <PERSON> Palumbo </PERSON>, who came to this country from his native <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> at age 26, has worked on the unfinished cathedral as a stonecarver since 1961. He succeeded his father as master carver after his father's death in 1966 Several years ago, <PERSON> Rex </PERSON> <PERSON> Scouten </PERSON>, then the head usher of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, asked <PERSON> Palumbo </PERSON> to repair a fireplace. Later he was asked to restore the columns of the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Portico </LOCATION> when it was repainted in 1984. The East wall of the building had been restored in 1980. In the current project, the remaining sandstone walls are being exposed for the first time since 1797, when the White House was first painted. In an interview in his shop at the cathedral, surrounded by gargoyles and blocks of marble, <PERSON> Palumbo </PERSON> says, `` It's a national thing. There is some kind of pride in being involved in restoring the residence of the president of the great nation. Here you have this immigrant who came over with almost nothing, and to be called to restore the White House is a great honor.'' The restoration, officials say, is much needed. Until 1980, the White House had been repainted about every four years. After a study requested by <PERSON> Scouten </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in 1976, the Bureau of Standards recommended that all the paint be chemically removed. Each section of wall is left bare for several months to allow the porous surface to dry. In the meantime, damaged stonework is restored. The sandstone for the White House was quarried from <LOCATION> Aquia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. The cornerstone was laid in 1792 and the walls were built and decorated from 1794 to 1798, the work being done by 10 to 12 stonecutters from <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. `` The walls represented the finest stonework yet produced in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and portions of them survive today, the only examples of 18th-century craftsmanship that remain in the building,'' architectural historian <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Seale </PERSON> wrote in his 1986 book, `` The President's House.'' `` It's still a good solid building,'' <PERSON> Palumbo </PERSON> says as he guides a visitor along a scaffolding on the North wall. `` It's just that the surface of the stone has been corroded.'' <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, who succeeded <PERSON> Scouten </PERSON> as chief usher, agrees. The Coast and Geodetic Survey examined the house in 1976 and attested that it was stable and not moving. Removal of the paint has disclosed both beauty and damage that were not known to be there. `` There are 39 layers of paint that are identifiable,'' <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> says. `` There may have been more than that. They just took the paintbrushes and crammed the paint in there and we'd find it 3 @ 8 of an inch thick in some of this stonecarving. It just hid a lot of this.''

 <LOCATION> WASHINGTON </LOCATION>: of this.'' Carved swags of foliage, dogwood blossoms, fish scale designs and roses surround the windows. Rich scrollwork tops the Ionic columns. But time, weather, the successive layers of paint and some clumsy restoration efforts along the way dealt unkindly with the Scotsmen's work. Just west of the main entrance on the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Avenue side of the residence, the keystone of an architrave, an arch-like stone window frame, cracked. Rainwater seeped in and froze. The resulting collapse caused a separation of nearly an inch between two of the windowframe blocks. The ornamental border of the window is also blackened, believed to have been caused when the British burned the White House in 1812. Most of the damage is less dramatic _ a piece missing here and there from a moulding, a crack in a ledge, a damaged rosette under a windowsill. Some broken dentils, the teeth-like blocks that project under the cornice, had been rebuilt by being encased with lead, apparently in a restoration carried out when President <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> had the West Wing built in 1901. The lead boxes held the moisture inside rather than letting it escape. `` I took off one of those boxes and the stone was just like mud, like mud,'' <PERSON> Palumbo </PERSON> says. All of the stones had to be replaced. All in all, the work has added up to more than they expected. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has appropriated $ 2.4 million for the job, and <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> says more money may be needed. <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> is saving chunks of crumbling stone to take with him to the next appropriations hearing. The stone being used in the restoration was removed from the Capitol during an expansion project in 1960 and 1961. It was quarried from <LOCATION> Aquia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> at the same time as the White House sandstone. This is the stone that the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> keeps in its maintenance yard in <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. `` Coming from the same quarry at the same time, it's the same density and has all the same characteristics,'' says <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> McDaniel </PERSON>, White House liaison officer for the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's as authentic as you can get.'' However, <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> says, `` one of the problems is that the big blocks of stone have been sitting there so long, and they were n't in the greatest of shape when they were taken off anyway.'' <PERSON> Palumbo </PERSON> estimates that about half of the stone is not usable. `` Anybody would say this is no good,'' says <PERSON> Palumbo </PERSON>, pointing to a battered block lying outside the North wall, trucked there after he marked it in the maintenance yard. `` But I go in the middle. This is a very good piece of stone inside. Very tight veined. Not porous. It will give you a very smooth face, very smooth.'' The veteran stonecutter likens the process to removing the bark from a tree to find the good wood. At the White House, he makes blue chalk marks on the wall to show sections that need to be replaced. A cardboard pattern is cut to fit, and the new piece hewn from the good stone. `` The paint has sealed the stone,'' he says. `` Stone needs to breathe, too. After they remove the paint, you will be surprised at the nice little foliage that will come out that people never knew was there.'' <PERSON> Palumbo </PERSON> recommends that the paint be stripped from the structure every 10 years and the stone be left exposed to the air for five or six months. On this day, the master carver had clambered under a clear plastic tarpaulin erected to protect the bare wall and was watching as <PERSON> Matteo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gennaro </PERSON>, who also worked on the project at the Capitol nearly two decades ago, labored with a carbide tool and an air hammer. `` You've got to chip away little by little, so it takes time, even with the air compressor,'' <PERSON> Palumbo </PERSON> says. `` If you want to do the job in an accurate way, want to do what you are supposed to do, restoration is very slow motion work.''

 Soft contact lenses, those floppy pieces of plastic that help people see without wearing eyeglasses, have reached a popular American culture benchmark. They've become disposable. That could mean a lot of changes involving the way people view the little lenses that make things clearer for 23 million Americans. Hundreds of thousands of people are already wearing disposable lenses, even though up to now they've been available only on a limited basis. Eye doctors are flocking to lectures about them, and consumers are wondering what's going on. `` They've really captured the interest of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public,'' says Dr. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> MacRae </PERSON>, an ophthalmologist from <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, who is also a consultant to the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> for ophthalmic devices. He speaks from experience. He wears a disposable lens in his right eye. `` I do n't think we've ever seen anything, in my experience, that gained this kind of acceptance,'' says <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, president of professional products at <ORGANIZATION> Bausch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Lomb, the nation's leading seller of contact lenses. `` We're in high gear. And I mean high gear.'' It has n't been too long ago that basketball games were stopped while players scoured the floor for a missing contact lens. Most people still coddle and clean their lenses, treating them like tiny treasures. They even buy insurance policies to protect them from loss or damage. Now, along come some lenses that can be worn for a week or two and tossed in the trash. If they hurt your eye, just take them out and put in a new pair. No more expensive cleaning solutions. No more tender-loving care. Is `` wear'em and toss'em'' the wave of the future? Probably not, say officials at <ORGANIZATION> Bausch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Lomb and other eye care experts. The main reason is that most of the most of the lenses available can only be worn by patients who are nearsighted. Another negative factor is the cost _ between $ 300 and $ 500 per year. Disposable contacts were introduced in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in July 1987 by <ORGANIZATION> Vistakon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, which up until March was the only maker of a disposable lens with national distribution. <ORGANIZATION> Vistakon </ORGANIZATION>'s throwaway lenses are called Accuvue. <ORGANIZATION> Bausch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Lomb started selling disposable contacts nationally in March and <ORGANIZATION> CIBA </ORGANIZATION> Vision, the second-leading maker, has started selling disposable contacts in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> that can be worn by both nearsighted and farsighted people. <ORGANIZATION> CIBA </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Little </PERSON> says lenses, called NewVues, should be available nationally later this year. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> says <ORGANIZATION> Bausch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Lomb expects that between 10 percent and 20 percent of all contact lens wearers in the country will switch to disposable lenses. But even that small percentage will have astounding business implications for the contact lens industry. Consider that a patient who normally would have walked into an optometrist's office and left with a new pair of lenses could now walk away with u to 52 pairs of lenses. The average disposable customer, using either a one-week or a two-week replacement schedule, will use 39 pairs of lenses a year. That means that instead of selling four million lenses a year to the roughly 2 million disposable customers, eye doctors will sell 156 million lenses a year. <ORGANIZATION> Bausch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Lomb is expanding its three largest contact lens manufacturing plants, including the renovation of an area in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, roughly the size of two football fields, that will be devoted to the company's SeeQuence line of disposable lenses. This flurry of activity is all possible because <ORGANIZATION> Bausch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lomb </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Vistakon </ORGANIZATION> have been able to dramatically lower the cost of making a contact lens. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> Aarons </PERSON>, a stock analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> D. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Little </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, estimates that <ORGANIZATION> Bausch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Lomb can make a disposable lens for less than $ 1, maybe as low as 75 cents. It sells two lenses for $ 5 to practitioners, who turn around and sell them for $ 7 to $ 10.

 The company's standard lens costs about $ 1.30 to make and is sold for between $ 15 to $ 30, <PERSON> Aarons </PERSON> says. Practitioners will sell each of those lenses for $ 40 to $ 50. `` They're selling a smaller number of lenses for a wider margin now. But with disposables, they'll be selling a huge number of lenses for a smaller margin,'' <PERSON> Aarons </PERSON> says. More important than the business implications, disposable contact lenses are going to play a key role in ushering in a whole new era in eye care among the many wearers of contact lenses in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` One of the things that we're seeing is that with the introduction of disposable lenses people are understanding that frequent lens replacement is a viable option,'' says <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Archer </PERSON>, director of marketing for <ORGANIZATION> Bausch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lomb </ORGANIZATION>'s professional products division. The average contact lens wearer replaces one lens a year, <PERSON> Archer </PERSON> says, and usually suffers some discomfort or some difficulty with a lens before deciding to replace it. If people begin to think that contact lenses are expendable, he says, they will be more likely to replace them, as often as every week or at least once a year. The only real difference between a daily-wear soft contact lens and a disposable lens is the recommended wearing time. Both are made of flexible plastic. Disposable lenses and extended-wear lenses are slightly thinner than daily-wear lenses, making them slightly more comfortable but slightly less durable. The label on the disposable lens container notes the lenses are only <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> approved for a maximum of two weeks at a time. Doctors were concerned that people would n't comply with the recommended wearing time, but so far studies are indicating that the compliance rate is very high. As far as cost, <ORGANIZATION> Bausch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Lomb has streamlined the technique used to make a contact lens and can now manufacture lenses 70 percent faster than several years ago. The increased volume has allowed the price to fall. <ORGANIZATION> Bausch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Lomb </ORGANIZATION> also offers a frequent lens replacement program that allows patients to get new lenses at different intervals, such as once a month or once every three months, and requires them to stick the discarded lenses on a card and mail them back to the company to insure compliance. <PERSON> Archer </PERSON> likens it to the dental care industry's effort that started three decades ago to promote the benefits of regular checkups and teeth cleaning to prevent tooth decay. Dr. <PERSON> Augustus </PERSON> <PERSON> Falcone </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION> optometrist who specializes in contact lenses, agrees with <PERSON> Archer </PERSON>. `` If you tell a patient about being able to change lenses every week, it starts the negotiation,'' <PERSON> Falcone </PERSON> says. `` OK, you do n't want to change your lenses every week How about every month? How about every three months? Whatever they pick is better than what they have now.'' Studies have shown that frequent replacement of lenses _ at intervals suggested by eye doctors _ can greatly reduce the risk of getting a severe eye injury from a contact lens, <PERSON> MacRae </PERSON> says. `` If disposable lenses get people to change their lenses more often, then they've probably done a good thing,'' he says. But <PERSON> MacRae </PERSON>, and many other eye doctors, still are not convinced that extended-wear contact lenses, like disposable contacts, are completely safe, no matter how often you replace them. He said a new study of 22,000 extended-wear contact lens wearers indicates that they are three to five times more likely to suffer a serious eye injury than someone who takes his lenses out at night. `` We do n't know why this is, but my hunch is that an extended-wear user does n't get enough oxygen to the cornea and this can cause problems,'' <PERSON> MacRae </PERSON> says. <PERSON> Falcone </PERSON> learned about the disposability of contact lenses nine years ago when professional golfer <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Peete </PERSON> came to him in the middle of a golf tournament in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION> because he had torn a contact lens. `` He could have won $ 24,000 and he had to withdraw because of a little piece of plastic,'' <PERSON> Falcone </PERSON> says. `` I mean, holy mackerel, what's a lens. So I started sending him fistfuls of lenses.''

 Just five years ago, the singing <PERSON> DeBarge </PERSON> family was at the top of the pop music world, promising to be one of Motown's brightest lights of the 1980s. The four brothers and a sister, with their silky harmonies first perfected while singing in their uncle's church choir, were often compared with the Jackson Five. Further, there were five more talented siblings who also were either already in the music business or were waiting in the wings. Since then, three of the siblings have been convicted of drug charges and at least two others have had other brushes with the law. Only one, <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> DeBarge </PERSON>, has remained in the musical spotlight. <PERSON> Etterlene </PERSON> <PERSON> DeBarge </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, the mother of 10 and grandmother of 15, blames drugs. `` In every life a little rain must fall, and this rain happened to be drugs,'' she says. `` They had a calling, but they deviated because they were young and very talented. There are so many vices out there to destroy you.'' Seated next to her recently in the family's stylish Grand Rapids home was son <PERSON> Jonathon </PERSON>, better known as `` Chico.'' Just two years after gaining national attention with his self-titled, pop-funk album on the Motown label, <PERSON> Chico </PERSON> was on his way to prison. Last June, at the same time he was planning a European concert tour, the 22-year-old singer-songwriter was stopped by federal authorities at <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> after returning from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. They found 2.2 pounds of cocaine in his bag and that of a companion. Brother <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>, 33, who gained notoriety in the late 1970s and early'80s with the now-defunct soul group Switch, also was convicted in the case. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> began serving a five-year, three-month prison term in February. On April 12, <PERSON> Chico </PERSON> began a five-year, eight-month sentence. In the past few years, Mrs. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> also has seen son El convicted of creating a disturbance for the beating of a <ORGANIZATION> Calvin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> student after she reportedly resisted his advances. She has seen son <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> spend time in jail for cocaine convictions and son <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> arrested for allegedly telling a stewardess he was carrying a bomb. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> believes the arrest of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> was a `` blessing in disguise'' because of what she says was a longtime drug habit. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> says her home is a gift from son <PERSON> El </PERSON>, as is the new Cadillac in the driveway. In the garage is a new black <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> has just bought for himself. The Rev. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Abney </PERSON> remembers how the family would captivate the audience as they sang in the choir at his <ORGANIZATION> Bethel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pentecostal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in Grand Rapids. But, he says, they were n't able to cope with their rapid rise to fame. `` It was like putting an ice-cold piece of glass into burning hot water,'' <PERSON> Abney </PERSON> says. `` It'll crack.'' Fame came first to <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> in the late 1970s and early'80s with the group Switch, which had a contract with Motown. The family struck gold again with Motown in the early'80s when siblings El, Bunny, <PERSON> James </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> and <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> hit the top of the soul charts and then crossed over to pop with a series of hits: `` Time Will Reveal,'' `` Rhythm of the Night'' and `` All This Love.'' With fame, however, came varying levels of success and the pressures of being in the spotlight. By 1986, the group had disbanded and El and <PERSON> Bunny </PERSON> wound up solo artists for Motown. The family is now spread across the country. El commutes between <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> with brother <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON>, who plays bass in his group. <PERSON> Marty </PERSON>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> and <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> are trying to get another recording contract and <PERSON> Bunny </PERSON> also is hoping to record again, <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> says. The youngest DeBarges, 19-year-old twins <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> and <PERSON> Darrell </PERSON>, are n't budding musicians, though <PERSON> Darrell </PERSON> wrote some songs on El's new album, `` Real Love,'' which has been rising on the Billboard charts since it was released in February In fact, almost every member of the family had some part in the new album. `` We're still together, just not market-wise,'' <PERSON> Chico </PERSON> says. <PERSON> Chico </PERSON> believes the music business and aggressive record companies are at the root of many performers' problems. `` The business is very deceitful,'' he says. `` It will deceive you and bring you up to where you ca n't handle things.'' <PERSON> Traci </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, vice president of publicity for Motown, which has signed <PERSON> Chico </PERSON> through 1992, would not discuss <PERSON> Chico </PERSON> or any other member of the <PERSON> DeBarge </PERSON> family. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, black-music critic for the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Times, was less reticent to critique the family's music. `` As a family, they never took off as people expected,'' he says. `` El seemed to be the most talented one. When he left, the others did n't seem to fare quite as well.'' <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> says the <PERSON> DeBarge </PERSON> family problems were well-known in the music community. `` People knew about their strange activities,'' he says. `` I ca n't think of any group there were more rumors about.'' Hunt is pessimistic about the group's future. `` There is nothing to indicate any niche for them now or in the future,'' he says. `` The main route to success for black musicians is through dance music, and that's taken more by women than men.'' <PERSON> Chico </PERSON> says he intends to write songs in prison about his experiences, but when he gets out he probably will turn to gospel music. That pleases his mother. `` I never wanted my children to be stars,'' she says. `` But they were young and talented and there are a lot of temptations out there.''

 Actress <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON> is turning historian, tapping memories to re-create a revolution in American acting led by the late <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Strasberg </PERSON> and the Group Theater. `` For a long time I'd wanted to do something about the Group Theater,'' she says. `` I did n't quite know what. When <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> died, I suddenly panicked and said, ` Pretty soon there wo n't be anybody left to tell the tale.''' Now, she is hosting `` Broadway's Dreamers: the Legacy of the Group Theater,'' the first program in the fourth season of the `` American Masters'' series on PBS. It will be televised on June 26. For Miss <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON>, it is the end product of five years of interviews, wedged into a busy career, which accounts for her changing hair colors and styles on-screen. There is also archival footage of the 1931-41 Group Theater. What surprised her most about her interview subjects, she says, `` is their depth of involvement and how immediate it was. They remembered everything like it was yesterday. It is 50 years ago and they're saying, ` <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said this and I said this.''' Founders of the Group Theater were <PERSON> Strasberg </PERSON>, who taught method acting, director <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Clurman </PERSON> and casting director <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>. They were dismayed at the lack of real life in the drawing room comedies of the 1920s. So they created the Group Theater to perform original <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> plays which would mirror _ and they hoped would change _ the life of their times. In the Depression they banded together with 28 actors who agreed to use an ensemble approach to acting. Most were in their 20s. <PERSON> Katharine </PERSON> <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON>, interviewed briefly during the show, says that at 21 she attended one planning meeting for the Group Theater and declined to join. She said she told them, `` I want to be a star.'' Miss <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON> says, `` I'd heard that story for years. I always kind of thought it was apocryphal.'' <PERSON> Elia </PERSON> <PERSON> Kazan </PERSON> recalls joining, as an apprentice, the second year. Instead of the Group Theater paying him, he paid $ 20 a week. When he ran out of money, he waited tables. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Garfield </PERSON> joined in 1934. Miss <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON> is shown, in 1987, directing `` Golden Boy'' in <LOCATION> Williamstown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, during the 90-minute TV show. The Group Theater first performed that <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> Odets </PERSON> play in 1937. `` Young actors -LRB- in <LOCATION> Williamstown </LOCATION> -RRB- had a hard time. You had to explore that naive passion,'' Miss <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON> says. `` That kind of naivete I think disappeared in World War II.'' The person seen most in the show is <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, an original Group Theater member who now teaches acting. `` <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> remembers everything in detail,'' Miss <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON> says. `` When in doubt we cut to <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON>. Is n't he funny?'' The actress studied acting with <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON> <PERSON> Meisner </PERSON>, an original member of the Group Theater. Her husband, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>, studied with <PERSON> Strasberg </PERSON>. She would like to have made the show more theatrical. `` I had visions of Bobby going with me to some of the camps where they worked in the summer. There was not time nor money. `` My dream is now to do a film about the Group Theater. I'm convinced there is a great deal more to be said I would direct it. I think that whole period is fascinating. It has never really been examined. I would imagine one would have to dramatize it, in a fictitious way. There are still, surprisingly enough, quite a few people around who were actively involved.'' The Group Theater did change American theater. For one thing, in 1933 it presented `` Men in White,'' Broadway's first hospital play. Now hospitals have become a staple of theater, film and soap opera. After the Group Theater dissolved, some one-time members were called before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Un-American Activities Committee. Some careers were ruined. The 14-week `` American Masters'' season, presented by WNET-New York, focuses on people in the creative arts who have shaped <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and world culture. Miss <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON> has a busy summer ahead. Daughter <PERSON> Clea </PERSON> gets married. Then Mr. <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> will rehearse their title roles in a <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivory-Ismail </PERSON> Merchant film, `` Mr. <PERSON> Bridge </PERSON> and Mrs. Bridge.'' She also attends <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> College </PERSON>. `` I went to college for two years. I started back about 1974. It's going to be the longest BA anybody has ever known. You do n't major at <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>. I just take lots of things. I'm taking playwriting. It's great fun.'' Returning to the subject of the Group Theater, she says, `` More than anything else, it refocused the life of the American theater. Author <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> talks about following your bliss. They followed their bliss. `` There may have been more brilliant theater movements, like <LOCATION> Orson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Welles </LOCATION>', or more intellectually amazing, like <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallienne </PERSON>'s. There was none that more desired change or were more passionate for the truth.''

 With a wicked smile and a wicked song, <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> lampoons the ladies and gents of the upper crust. He sings about the foibles, follies and fads of high-powered, high-society folk like <PERSON> Ivana </PERSON> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Trump </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> -RRB-, <PERSON> David </PERSON> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, <PERSON> Brooke </PERSON> -LRB- Astor -RRB- and <PERSON> William </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Paley </PERSON> -RRB-. And they love it. In less than two years, the sprite-like, 27-year-old <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> has gone from private party entertainer to budding cabaret star. Now he's appearing through May at the fabled Oak Room in the Algonquin Hotel where he's singing not only about people like Mrs. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> and her yacht and Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and her new life in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, but about such topics as the water shortage and trash TV. He's a combination of Cole Porter and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehrer </PERSON> with a bit of <PERSON> Noel </PERSON> <PERSON> Coward </PERSON> thrown in for good measure. `` I write the words and the music. I play the piano and sing,'' <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> explains. `` So if the evening is terrible, it's all my fault.'' It was never hard to get <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> to perform. He was born in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, the son of an opera singer and a civil servant. At the age of 3, he saw `` The Sound of Music,'' came home, sat down at the piano and played every song from the show _ with one finger. `` I used to drive all of my piano teachers crazy because I'd be playing <PERSON> Chopin </PERSON> or <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON>, and I'd always think of what I thought was a nicer way of finishing a phrase,'' he says, recalling his precocious childhood. At <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> majored in English and art history, but when he came to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, he worked long hours for little pay in public relations and fund-raising. But he got to observe the rich at close quarters. He also got to attend parties, lots of them. `` When there was nothing left to revive a party, I was thrown toward the piano to play and sing,'' he says. `` People said, ` Why do n't you do this all the time?''' He finally did. His big break came last May when he was hired by fashion designer <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> `` the Prince of Chintz'' <PERSON> Buatta </PERSON> to play for a society dinner at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> wrote five new songs for the occasion. `` If you are burning with the love of learning, write a check to the public library,'' he crooned in his best fund-raising voice. But he also wrote songs about <PERSON> Brooke </PERSON> <PERSON> Astor </PERSON> and <PERSON> Annette </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, two of the biggest supporters of the library. The ditties suggested that Mrs. <PERSON> Astor </PERSON> change her first name from <PERSON> Brooke </PERSON> to Book and Mrs. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> spell her last name R-e-a-d. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> was a big success, and people began calling to ask if he'd appear at their parties, playing original `` I was terrified of asking for money,'' he says. `` I'm English, so I'm terrible at dealing with money.'' At first, <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> would immediately say yes to a job and then ask about the fee. Often it was less than $ 500. Today, he has an agent at <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> and his price for an evening's work can go as high as $ 3,000. He serenaded Mrs. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> last summer aboard the Trump Princess, her husband's $ 30 million yacht. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> writes during regular, 9-to-5 office hours, but finds pressure the best tonic for non-productivity. `` The idea of a deadline and a check at the end of it is irresistible for writing new songs,'' he says. Some of his best songs have been born on airplanes and trains. For the reopening of <ORGANIZATION> Blair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> wrote a song about it on a cocktail napkin, while he was flying from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to the nation's capital. And for his Algonquin engagement, <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> has written different types of songs. `` God knows, not everybody is interested in society's darlings,'' he says `` So I've written a love song or two. As well as one number about the former president called ` The <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> at Home in Bel Air.''' <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> suddenly begins reciting: `` The <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is awfully nervous `` They ca n't think what to do. `` They are meant to take care of the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> `` But the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> seem awfully blue. `` They are finding it hard to adjust to being ordinary folk `` And the pressure's not fair. `` Though their friends bought them quite a swell house. `` It's no fun being the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> at home in Bel Air.'' <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> also is working on a musical called `` How To Bag a Billionaire,'' a look at today's version of what used to be called golddiggers, those women who want to marry for money and not necessarily love. `` I'm selfishly writing the whole thing, the book and songs, but I wo n't be in it,'' he says. The show has been delayed while <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> completes his Algonquin engagement, and he tries to juggle all his offers from the rich and the famous. `` I find myself now invited to all the big parties _ the serious, social parties, which is a peculiar thing,'' <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> says. `` I spend time with these people. They must be aware that I am watching them every second to see how they are behaving. Maybe people think they are flirting with danger in a very acceptable way by having me around.''

 `` Clara's Heart'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION>. VHS-Beta, $ 89.95. Rated PG-13 -RRB- <PERSON> Clara </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayfield </PERSON> is a brutally direct woman who colors her human relationships with a good deal of common sense, self-righteousness and tenacity. She also has an overwhelming humanity about her, and that specialness attracts people to her like a magnet. <PERSON> Clara </PERSON> is a vibrant and rich role, one that critics last year said could easily turn around <PERSON> Whoopi </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>'s dismal film career after such losers as `` Burglar,'' `` Jumpin' Jack Flash'' and `` Fatal Beauty.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulligan </PERSON> -LRB- `` To Kill a Mockingbird,'' `` Inside Daisy Clover'' -RRB- restrains <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> in his direction of this family melodrama, allowing none of the bits and business that have become the trademarks of her wealth of comic stage characters. That restraint is essential to Clara herself, a Jamaican with a dark secret. <PERSON> Clara </PERSON> enters the lives of the affluent <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> family from <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shore </LOCATION>, shortly after the crib death of their daughter. <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinlan </PERSON> -RRB- and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ontkean </PERSON> -RRB- have gone to <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> to help get over the tragedy. <PERSON> Clara </PERSON> is their hotel maid. She coaxes <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> out of her depression and encourages her to get on with life. <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> decides to bring her back to <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> _ she ca n't quite function without <PERSON> Clara </PERSON>'s island sensibilities. But son <PERSON> David </PERSON> takes an immediate dislike to <PERSON> Clara </PERSON> and accuses his parents _ rightfully so _ of bringing her home so they wo n't have to deal with him. The Harts are in the process of a divorce. <PERSON> Clara </PERSON> eventually wins over <PERSON> David </PERSON> to the point where he'd rather spend his weekends in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Clara </PERSON> and her West Indian friends than with his parents. He also picks up <PERSON> Clara </PERSON>'s island patois. But his dependency on Clara ultimately leads to her dark revelation. And it is here that the movie falters. There is no build-up to this awful experience in her life, and its unfolding is an abrupt twist. And with the tale, there remain loose ends: Letters hidden in a suitcase and found by <PERSON> David </PERSON> are never explained; the father of <PERSON> Clara </PERSON>'s child also is a mystery. Still, `` Clara's Heart'' is a warm movie with many lessons to tell, if one is willing to listen. It's a movie that works better on the small screen than it did theatrically. Its force is aided by <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>'s performance and a noteworthy movie debut of <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> as <PERSON> David </PERSON>. There's also a lilting score by <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Grusin </PERSON>, but once again <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> fails in geography: Steel music and calypso are products of <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION>, not <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>.

 `` Running on Empty'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION>. VHS-Beta, $ 89.95. Rated PG-13 -RRB- What ever happened to all those Weather people from the late 1960s and early'70s, all those revolutionaries who bombed government buildings and corporations with government contracts? All those radicals who may have killed innocents in the name of freedom and liberty? They went underground. But underground is as ordinary as the family next door. `` Running on Empty'' looks at such a family, who have been wanted by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> for their part in a bombing in which a security guard was accidently killed. The young couple made one mistake, though. Not only did they take their young son, <PERSON> Danny </PERSON>, with them as they fled, they also conceived another child while underground, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON>. Cut to the'80s. <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> -LRB- <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> -RRB- is a 17-year-old musical prodigy. What to do. If he stays with his parents, as they want him to, he must give up all ambitions in music and indeed give up his own destiny. If he leaves them and heads for the <ORGANIZATION> Juilliard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, he will never be able to see them again unless they surrender to authorities. There is much tenderness in this movie, especially from <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Lahti </PERSON> as the mother. <PERSON> Judd </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON>'s father seems somewhat outmoded in his'60s politics and'60s perceptions. He's also a little selfish. He's not a very likeable man until the end, and resolution of the movie. <PERSON> Naomi </PERSON> <PERSON> Foner </PERSON> has a tight and gripping screenplay, and <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Lumet </PERSON>'s direction is powerful. It's a nice movie for the entire family because `` Running on Empty'' is ultimately about family.

 `` The Great Lawn'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Traut </PERSON> and <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodby </PERSON>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 That could be a typo in the title of the debut album by the quasi-jazz duo of electric guitarist <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Traut </PERSON> and bassist <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodby </PERSON>. `` The Great Yawn'' would be more like it. The record is appealing for its sparse texture, but once the novelty of these simple instrumental arrangements wears off, there's little to sustain a listener's attention. `` The Great Lawn'' is most reminiscent of <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Metheny </PERSON> _ <PERSON> Traut </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rodby </PERSON> have both played with him. But <PERSON> Traut </PERSON> is n't nearly as inventive a guitarist; he rarely strays far from the melody. And <PERSON> Traut </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rodby </PERSON> seem to be waiting for each other to take charge. As a result, the energy level peaks at about a two on a 10-point scale. The most animated the duo gets is when <PERSON> Rodby </PERSON> occasionally slaps his bass. One wonders how much the label, <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, had to do with the artists' cautious approach to their debut. The company hails the record as spanning `` many musical categories _ Jazz, <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Age </ORGANIZATION>, Pop, R & amp; B ... and Beautiful.'' With <PERSON> Traut </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rodby </PERSON> trying to please so many audiences, it's a wonder they were able to come up with any notes at all. `` The Great Lawn'' is OK as background music, but bring a book along. _ By <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Wine </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` Mr. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>'' -LRB- <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> -RRB- _ <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> <PERSON> You </PERSON>'re <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>, and you've got two image problems to dispel. One is that you're a wimp. The other is you sound too much like your late father. The surprising vigor of <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>'s third album, `` Mr. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>,'' takes care of the first problem. And the new deep voice <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> unveils handles the second. But now he sounds like <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowie </PERSON>. Really. It's uncanny, on the songs `` Now You're in Heaven'' and `` I Want You to Know,'' how much <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> sounds like the late-period <PERSON> Bowie </PERSON>. Sounding too much like someone else, of course, is never a good sign for a musician. Actually, you should be glad you're not <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>. He's not to be envied. To be the son of such an icon and emerge with your head on straight is a victory in itself. To follow in your dad's footsteps and have at least nominal success is quite an achievement But let's face it, <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> really should find another line of work. <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> has no real style and precious little to say. `` Mr. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>'' proves only that he can surround himself with adept professionals and not be embarrassed. One wonders if the louder guitars and harsher rhythms on `` Mr. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>'' show <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>'s true inclinations as a rocker or his Zelig-like response to those who said he should toughen his sound. `` I Get Up,'' with lively back-up vocals, is the best effort here. But even on this song <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> sees fit to include an Elvis Presley impersonation. Who's next? The more aggressive approach sounds better than the ponderous sweetness of <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>'s first two albums. But only nominally. And do n't look to <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> for any sparkling originality. _ By <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauder </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Costner </PERSON>, clad in his customary costume of jeans, T-shirt, sweater and day-old beard, arrived late for an interview but presented a valid excuse: He had been picking up tips on film directing from movie giant <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON>. `` I need all the help I can get, and who could be a better teacher?'' remarked <PERSON> Costner </PERSON>, who starts directing himself in a film next July. <PERSON> Costner </PERSON>'s modest office at <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION> studios, where he once worked as a laborer, displays evidence of the new project. On the walls are dozens of note-pad pages detailing each scene of the film, as yet untitled. Next he plans to storyboard _ an artist's concept of each camera angle. `` I need to have that backup,'' he explained. `` I'll leave a window for new things to come in -LRB- during filming -RRB-. I need to communicate to many people what I'm trying to do. Those ideas can be built upon.'' <PERSON> Costner </PERSON> gave no specifics on what he had learned from <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON>, but said both men had been `` dancing around each other'' in search of a mutual project. `` The only time I worked for <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> was when I did an ` Amazing Stories' for him,'' the actor said, referring to the old TV show. Three years ago, <PERSON> Costner </PERSON> was known mostly for playing the corpse in `` The Big Chill.'' Then came `` Silverado,'' `` The Untouchables'' and `` No Way Out.'' For his new film, `` Field of Dreams,'' he reportedly was paid $ 2.5 million. So why take on the added labor of directing his next film? `` I have to maintain interest in what I'm doing. This particular subject generates a certain amount of interest for me. When this project was born, it was not on the surface a very commercial movie. Yet I believe it's very commercial. `` The theme of it is people who want to talk to each other but ca n't, because of the language barrier -LRB- between white settlers and Indians -RRB-. It's a period piece set in the 1860s. This is not a movie to set the record straight, or to reinvent what happened. It's just a theatrical piece, but it's more than that, too. There's a lot of action in it.'' There's not much action in `` Field of Dreams,'' a baseball fantasy which some critics have described as Capra-esque. <PERSON> Costner </PERSON> plays an <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> farmer who heeds a mystery voice and builds a baseball diamond in his cornfield; soon the ghosts of the infamous <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION> team show up to play. <PERSON> Costner </PERSON> acknowledged that the script, based on the novel `` Shoeless Joe'' by W.P. <PERSON> Kinsella </PERSON>, was a tough sell. Writer-director <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Alden </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> worked on it for six years before getting it made. `` I did n't have to be convinced of it,'' <PERSON> Costner </PERSON> remarked. `` The minute I read it, I thought that I would want to do this movie. `` Why? I do n't know. I make movies, and you need to have subjects. The amount of movies I'll do in my life are numbered; it's a finite number. As a script passes over me, it has to reach me emotionally. I do n't care what genre it is, comedy or action or something else. Those do n't dictate what I'll do. But it just has to have a certain amount of poignancy. `` ` Field of Dreams' did. It also had what I'm always looking for: other strong, strong characters. So I knew that we would be able to attract good actors.'' Among them: <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Lancaster </PERSON>, <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Madigan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Liotta </PERSON>. <PERSON> Costner </PERSON> was born in a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> suburb, son of a power lineman who was part-Cherokee -LRB- which helps explain his next project -RRB-. His father's work required repeated moves, and <PERSON> Costner </PERSON> recalls of school, `` I was always on the outside.'' He studied marketing at <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Fullerton </ORGANIZATION>, but also acted in a community theater. After marrying his college sweetheart, <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>, a former Snow White at <LOCATION> Disneyland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> quit a marketing job to try <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>. He spent six years as a set worker at <ORGANIZATION> Raleigh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION>, studying at night in acting workshops. After his flashback scene was cut from `` The Big Chill,'' <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasdan </PERSON> cast him as the hell-raising gunslinger in `` Silverado.'' He clicked immediately. Because he believes he should support all his films, <PERSON> Costner </PERSON> did the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> media whirl for `` Field of Dreams.'' He readily admits that he does n't enjoy it. He is an extremely private man, yet he does n't dwell on his loss of privacy. `` As many doors that close to you, there are others that open up,'' he reasoned. `` I do n't think anybody has been able to resolve the privacy issue. You still see people who have a certain amount of fame and do n't know how to deal with it. `` There's no good answer for when something that is unique to an individual _ their privacy _ is taken away. ... When you experience the loss of that, it's something you'll never ever get back in your life. There's no reason to cry or to pout. `` It's something I'll never get back. It's like my daughter as she grows older, she'll never be a baby again. You have to enjoy those times. My son just started to walk. We probably will not have any more children, so there will never be another helpless, helpless child. That phase is gone.'' The Costners recently bought a getaway home in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>, but their main residence is not on the trendy <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>, but in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, a few miles from the <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rose </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bowl </LOCATION>. `` We bought our first home in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` A lot of our friends are out there, so we can keep those relationships up.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Artist's Once-Scorned Work Now Hot</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY FOSTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OCEAN SPRINGS, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Down a dusty shell road and through a tangle of azalea blossoms and magnolia trees, the little cottage stands quietly these days. The tempest of <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s life is over; only the beauty lives on. `` He was an amazing man and I guess there were a lot who did n't understand him,'' said his daughter, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickard </PERSON>. `` He had a sad life in so many ways, but when I look at his work I think he must have reached his own peace. I do n't see how he could have been sad and done such happy work.'' Even here in his hometown, where residents once demanded that one of his greatest works be painted over, the eccentric artist has finally found favor. <PERSON> Pickard </PERSON>, 51, who has been the curator of her father's work for the last 11 years, regularly leads visitors through the cottage. Psychiatrists, psychologists, environmentalists, scientists and artists come to see the massive body of work <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> left behind. `` It really pleases me that such a variety of people have become interested in his work,'' <PERSON> Pickard </PERSON> said. After being hospitalized in 1937 for a nervous breakdown, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> left his wife and four children and lived alone in the three-room cottage tucked away on the family compound in this sleepy Gulf Coast town. His love of <LOCATION> Horn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, an uninhabited barrier island 12 miles off shore, led to an intense study of the plants and animals of the island that he recorded in his detailed logs, paintings and drawings. `` He felt that the artist had an obligation to call attention to the world around him. As far back as the 1940s he felt that man and the world around him were going in opposite directions,'' <PERSON> Pickard </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> was the first to notice that the eggs of the brown pelican were not hatching and to blame wastes from the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> for it, <PERSON> Pickard </PERSON> said. In the last 15 years of his life, he spent most of his time alone on <LOCATION> Horn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, rowing there in a wooden skiff which he would turn over and use for shelter. To study the creatures of the Gulf Coast more carefully, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> would submerge himself up to his nose in the swamps and bayous around the area, staying there for hours while snakes and alligators swam past him and birds and bugs flew over him. It was not until his death at the age of 62 in 1965 that the full range and immensity of his work was discovered. An avid reader, he left behind at least 9,000 illustrative drawings. He had done 300 linoleum blocks from which he printed drawings he would then paint and sell for $ 1 per foot. Most of his wood sculptures have disappeared with time. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> left them in the woods around his cottage, and they were destroyed by storms, <PERSON> Pickard </PERSON> said. Most of the furniture he designed and built has also been lost. He also worked in ceramics, textiles and did a number of oils. But he has become best known for the small watercolors he did of the plants and animals of the Gulf Coast area. The paintings, elaborate in detail and rich in color, were done on typing paper and the few he sold during his life went for no more than $ 25, <PERSON> Pickard </PERSON> said. Today they sell for $ 3,500 to $ 6,000, according to <PERSON> Courtney </PERSON> <PERSON> Blossman </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Friends </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anderson </ORGANIZATION>, a group that plans to break ground for a $ 1.2 million Anderson museum in June. The mural which he painted on the walls of the town community center, which many residents wanted painted over, will be the centerpiece of the museum, <PERSON> Blossman </PERSON> said. `` It's amazing, but it's true. Some people were very upset with the mural when he painted it, `` <PERSON> Blossman </PERSON> said. `` It was appraised for $ 1 million 10 years ago. I'm sure it would be much higher now.'' The mural depicts the history of the area on one side of the building, and what <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> saw as the `` seven seasons'' of the Gulf Coast on the other. He charged the town $ 1 to paint it on the then-new structure in 1950 and worked on it for two years. `` I've heard he was never paid the dollar he asked,'' said <PERSON> Pickard </PERSON>. `` People treated him terribly over it. He always said it was n't finished. He quit working on it because people would come at all hours and bother him _ make fun of it and talk about it.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As the bassist and songwriting partner of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, <PERSON> Deon </PERSON> <PERSON> Estus </PERSON> is used to playing to capacity crowds. But the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> native has also learned to appreciate an empty arena. <PERSON> Estus </PERSON>, who now has a hit single of his own with `` Heaven Help Me,'' likes to arrive early for the evening's concert so he can pursue his favorite hobby: Frisbee. `` On the road I carry about 40 Frisbees with kneepads and gloves,'' he said. `` As they set up the equipment before the show, either in the stadium or outside the arena, there are no people around. When we played the <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bowl </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, we had a ball. Everybody joined in.'' Between playing for one of the world's most successful recording artists and making his debut solo album, `` Spell,'' <PERSON> Estus </PERSON> has needed to stay in shape. He is already at work on another record and will collaborate with <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> on the singer's next project, a double LP. `` We understand each other,'' said <PERSON> Estus </PERSON>, who referred to the singer as his best friend. `` We get along, we go out and have dinner. It's very easy to sit down and come up with a song. We just sit down and write good music. He's very professional and so am I. He's not in competition with me.'' <PERSON> Estus </PERSON>, whose parents both hold graduate degrees in music, had any number of instruments to chose from as a child, remembering the drums, bass, guitars and piano his father brought home. He quickly mastered them all but admitted to having no such luck playing the saxophone. `` I got rid of it, eventually,'' <PERSON> Estus </PERSON> said. `` It just used to kill me. It just was n't for me. It sounded like people when they screech chalk on the blackboard.'' <PERSON> Estus </PERSON> settled on the bass and was playing professionally by age 12. `` I used to play house parties in the summer and got 20 bucks each time. That was a lot of dough.'' <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> in the 1960s was home to the Motown record label and <PERSON> Estus </PERSON> took full advantage of the local talent. He became friends with <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaye </PERSON> but turned down the opportunity to play on the late singer's last album, `` Midnight Love,'' released in 1982. `` That was a time when I was busy recording. I did n't have any idea he'd be leaving us so fast,'' said <PERSON> Estus </PERSON>, referring to <PERSON> Gaye </PERSON>'s murder in 1984 `` I thought I'd see him again. Everybody had troubles but I did n't sense that anything like that would happen.'' <PERSON> Estus </PERSON> referred to Motown bassist <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Jamerson </PERSON> as `` my teacher.'' <PERSON> Jamerson </PERSON>, who died in 1983, was instrumental to the Motown sound, creating memorable bass lines on such hits as `` Reach Out I'll Be There'' and `` Ai n't No Mountain High Enough.'' `` He's the man who brought syncopation to the bass,'' <PERSON> Estus </PERSON> said. `` ` My Cherie Amour.' Listen to the bass parts on that. He was a mindblower. I just never heard bass put like that _ the expression. When you listen to records today you hear his influence.'' <PERSON> Estus </PERSON>' first band was `` Brainstorm,'' which toured in support of the Whispers and the <PERSON> Brothers </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> among other groups. He moved to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in the early'80s, and lived in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> before eventually settling in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, his current home. `` I think I've been influenced by everywhere I've been,'' <PERSON> Estus </PERSON> said. `` <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, for instance. When I first worked there I'd listen to these local bands. The harmonies were really tricky. I was listening to this rhythm and thought this was the thing closest to black music I'd heard. I learned a great deal from it.'' <PERSON> Estus </PERSON> was the silent partner of `` Wham!,'' the British band that featured <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> and <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridgeley </PERSON> and had hits in the mid -'80s with `` Careless Whisper'' and `` I'm Your Man After Wham! broke up, <PERSON> Estus </PERSON> stayed with <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, working on the singer's best-selling `` Faith'' LP. He found time, however, to record `` Spell'' and served as <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>'s opening act on the world tour. `` Heaven Help Me,'' which features <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> on backing vocals, is a catchy mid-tempo ballad, but <PERSON> Estus </PERSON> rated the title song of `` Spell'' as his favorite. `` I got a chance to produce it and I like the orchestration. It's a fun song, a strong song. Some songs on ` Spell' are more danceable than others, some are poppy, some are soulful.'' He appeared unconcerned that having a hit record of his own could jeopardize the partnership with <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>. `` If I had a No. 1 album and he had a No. 3 album and he asked me to open for him, I would say, ` Yes.' If this album sold 2 or 3 million, I would still play with him. It's just dealing with egos.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Virginia Woolf as Incest Survivor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GENEVA COLLINS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 We know <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Woolf </PERSON> the writer, who gave us such ground-breaking novels as `` To the Lighthouse,'' `` Mrs. <PERSON> Dalloway </PERSON>'' and `` The Waves.'' We know <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Woolf </PERSON> the feminist, who wrote the influential essay `` A Room of One's Own,'' and <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Woolf </PERSON> the pacifist, who created `` Thoughts on Peace in an Air Raid.'' We know <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Woolf </PERSON> the diarist, who logged the minutiae of her tortured life, and <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Woolf </PERSON> the suicide, who put a heavy stone in her pocket and waded into the <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ouse </LOCATION>. But until now we have known very little about the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Woolf who was sexually abused throughout her youth. A noted Woolf scholar, <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> DeSalvo </PERSON>, provides us with the first complete portrait of that woman in `` <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Woolf </LOCATION>: The Impact of Childhood Sexual Abuse on Her Life and Work'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Beacon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, $ 22.95 -RRB-. That Woolf had been abused was no secret _ she talked about it in speeches, letters, conversations and memoirs. But previous biographers have virtually ignored its impact on her life, treating it as an aberration in an otherwise happy Victorian household or perhaps even a hallucination of her `` madness.'' <PERSON> DeSalvo </PERSON>, a professor of English at <ORGANIZATION> Hunter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, is the first academician to thoroughly examine the abuse in light of modern-day research on incest survivors. `` It's not as if it was hidden as a topic in any of the biographies that have come before,'' <PERSON> DeSalvo </PERSON> said in a recent interview at her Hunter office. `` But the major change is that in the last 10 years the work on incest and child abuse as a field has been so monumental that it enabled someone like me to use that work and to read her life in the context of what we now know the effect of incest and child abuse are.'' A brief outline of <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Woolf </ORGANIZATION>'s family and the abuse suffered, based on <ORGANIZATION> Woolf </ORGANIZATION>'s diaries, letters and recorded conversations with others: <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> Duckworth </PERSON> and Sir <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Woolf </PERSON>'s parents, had each been married before they wed in 1878 <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stella </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Duckworth </PERSON> were children of <PERSON> Julia </PERSON>'s previous marriage; <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> was a child of Sir <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON>'s first marriage. <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> had four children together: <PERSON> Vanessa </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Thoby </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Adrian </PERSON>. <PERSON> Woolf </PERSON>'s mother died when she was 13 and about that time her step-brother, <PERSON> George </PERSON>, 14 years her senior, began sexually molesting her and her sister, <PERSON> Vanessa </PERSON>. The abuse continued until <PERSON> Woolf </PERSON> was in her early 20s and stopped only when she had a nervous breakdown after her father died and the household was broken up. <PERSON> Stella </PERSON>, <PERSON> Woolf </PERSON>'s step-sister who took over the running of the household after their mother's death, may have become her step-father's lover after his wife died. Late in her life, <LOCATION> Woolf </LOCATION>, in a period of intense self-analysis while writing her autobiography, suddenly remembered an incident that had apparently been repressed of being molested by her other step-brother, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON>, when she was 6, in which he broke her hymen. <PERSON> DeSalvo </PERSON> thinks <PERSON> Woolf </PERSON> was devastated by the realization that the abuse began far earlier than she had believed. There is plenty of other evidence of the household as a dysfunctional family: <ORGANIZATION> Woolf </ORGANIZATION> had an erotic relationship with her sister, <PERSON> Vanessa </PERSON>, that lasted into their 20s; <ORGANIZATION> Woolf </ORGANIZATION>'s step-sister, <PERSON> Laura </PERSON>, whom the family considered mentally deficient, was locked up in a distant room in the house for years before being trundled off to an asylum; <ORGANIZATION> Woolf </ORGANIZATION>'s brother, <PERSON> Thoby </PERSON>, threw himself out of a window when he was 15; <PERSON> Woolf </PERSON> had an affair with <PERSON> Vanessa </PERSON>'s first husband; after her divorce, <PERSON> Vanessa </PERSON> took up with the homosexual lover of her brother, <PERSON> Adrian </PERSON>. The list of family entanglements goes on and on and continues into the next generation. <PERSON> DeSalvo </PERSON> reread everything that <PERSON> Woolf </PERSON> wrote _ every novel, diary, letter, essay and fragment that has been preserved in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> _ and isolated every reference to <PERSON> Woolf </PERSON>'s childhood or her fictional depictions of children `` It was when I did that that it was all thrown into stark relief, and I saw what she was trying to say,'' said <PERSON> DeSalvo </PERSON>. Once she learned how incest survivors talk about their experiences, <PERSON> DeSalvo </PERSON> said <PERSON> Woolf </PERSON>'s sometimes puzzling language suddenly made sense. In a letter to <PERSON> Vanessa </PERSON>'s husband, for example, <PERSON> Woolf </PERSON> writes almost flippantly about the sexual abuse the two suffered. <PERSON> DeSalvo </PERSON> said that is an example of `` inappropriate response'' that victims of incest often use as a defense mechanism. `` The key to my own beginning to be able to figure it out was learning what the language of incest survivors is, learning the verbal strategies. How survivors of incest tend to create inflated pictures of their parents. ... `` I could n't figure out, for example, for the longest time why <PERSON> Woolf </PERSON> wrote these revered portraits of her father. If you take them straight, that's one thing, but if you read how incest survivers typically talk about the family constellation, it makes an enormous amount of sense.'' One of the points DeSalvo makes in her book is that some of the symptoms of the bouts of `` madness'' Woolf suffered throughout her life _ depression, nervousness, irritability, tantrums _ are likely responses to the sexual abuse rather than the congenital condition it is often treated as. <PERSON> DeSalvo </PERSON> was asked whether she ever thought <PERSON> Woolf </PERSON>, with her history of instability, was perhaps an `` unreliable narrator.'' The memory of the abuse by <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> when she was 6, for example, did not surface until <PERSON> Woolf </PERSON> was in her 50s. Can her memory be trusted? `` One of the biggest issues that always comes up in incestuous abuse is the extent to which people falsify memories. The paradigm used to be Freudian -LRB- the theory that patients' reports of sexual abuse were figments of their imaginations and based on desire -RRB-. ... All the recent work that has been done on incest survivors suggest rather the opposite _ that any memories are authentic, and the reason experts say this is that it is so disastrous, even today, to be labeled an incest survivor that no one would falsify that.'' <PERSON> DeSalvo </PERSON> is the editor of `` Melymbrosia,'' an early version of <ORGANIZATION> Woolf </ORGANIZATION>'s novel `` The Voyage Out,'' which she constructed from manuscripts, and co-editor with <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> Leaska </PERSON> of `` <PERSON> Vita </PERSON> <PERSON> Sackville-West </PERSON>'s Letters to <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Woolf </ORGANIZATION>.'' She has also written a book on <PERSON> Nathaniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawthorne </PERSON>. <PERSON> DeSalvo </PERSON>'s new book, as disturbing as the subject matter is, should be heralded for both its painstakingly thorough research and the delicate and fair handling of such a sensitive subject. This is a scholarly, not a titillating work. At the same time, it is enormously readable and imbued with the fascination and admiration that <PERSON> DeSalvo </PERSON> has for one of the greatest writers of this century.

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Barbara Mandrell Revives Memories Of Accident</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Entertainer <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandrell </PERSON> curtailed her career as she recovered from the physical and emotional injuries of an automobile accident. She also tried to forget the tragedy, which claimed the life of a young man. Now, though, she's revived those memories in her upcoming autobiography for <ORGANIZATION> Bantam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Books </ORGANIZATION>, `` Never Say Never.'' `` Until this book, I have never shared these things except with my neurosurgeon and my attorney,'' the 40-year-old singer said in an interview. `` Other than this book, I have kind of reached a point where I'm tired of being asked about it I chose to forget it. But the tragedy was part of my life, and I had to put it in. In order for people to know me, I felt I must tell the down side. The chapter on the crash was very difficult to do.'' <PERSON> Mandrell </PERSON> was involved in a two-car collision north of <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> on Sept. 11, 1984. She suffered a concussion and fractures to her leg and ankle. Her two children also were hurt, but not seriously. However, the driver of the other car, a 19-year-old college student, died. The book is being written with author <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Vecsey </PERSON>, who helped country queen <PERSON> Loretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> write her `` Coal Miner's Daughter.'' Finishing the autobiography is just one of a multitude of projects for the singer who's been a recording artist for 20 years. Her second gospel album, `` Precious Memories,'' has just been released. Her Las Vegas-style show, regarded as one of the best among country music-oriented performers, is undergoing its annual fine-tuning. She has had one week-long stint performing in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> this year and has two more scheduled. `` My throat wo n't take more than a week at a time,'' she said. And she is selecting songs for another country album due out in the fall. `` I'm working a lot more this year,'' she said. `` I told my agent that except for January and July, to book me three days a month. But some of those three days turned into a week.'' She's rarely been off the TV screen since her network variety show that began in 1980 and lasted two seasons, `` <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandrell </PERSON> and the Mandrell Sisters.'' She's done a half dozen specials with comedian <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hope </PERSON>, including his most recent one in March. And she's been in countless other TV specials, ranging from appearances with former President and Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to one celebrating the Special Olympics. `` I just said no to two more recently,'' she said. One of them was to be taped during a week she and her family had set aside for camping. `` My priorities were to be a mommy and wife that week,'' she said. Her gospel album is a follow-up to her previous gospel-oriented `` He Set My Life to Music,'' which won a Grammy Award in 1983. The new one includes such gospel standards as `` Peace in the <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>,'' `` Old Rugged Cross,'' `` Just a Closer Walk With Thee'' and `` I Love to Tell the Story.'' `` It was hard to narrow it down to the 20 we picked,'' <PERSON> Mandrell </PERSON> said. `` I had the best time doing this album. For any <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION>, especially one who sings for a living, the feeling is very special. `` These are songs that I feel are mine and you feel are yours. They belong to each of us. We grew up singing them. I had so many memories as I recorded them, of singing them in church or singing along to the radio. `` This was a nice, unexpected pleasure. Now I'll have these on record for the rest of my life. When I'm gone, my children and grandchildren will have them.'' She has a persistent passion for another hit record to join her others: `` I Was Country -LRB- When Country Was n't Cool -RRB-,'' `` Married, But Not to Each Other,'' `` Only a Lonely Heart Knows,'' `` Sleeping Single in a Double Bed'' and `` If Loving You Is Wrong -LRB- I Do n't Want to Be Right -RRB-.'' `` It's a never-ending desire. My biggest goal is to stay close enough in tune with what the public wants in order to earn the career they are giving me. I've never been satisfied with me. I always want to be better and I pray I never lose that desire. `` We're chomping at the bit to make my show better. I compete with me.''

 Scientists at the world's busiest AIDS testing laboratory face not only blood samples contaminated with a deadly disease, but peeling paint, exploding lightbulbs and a sink with no drain. There's even a sign on the elevator warning not to use it; it gets stuck. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, a leader in AIDS testing and research in this country largely because it has more AIDS patients than any other state, does most of this key scientific work in a laboratory built in 1917. Potholes line the driveway leading to the three-story brick building, where gleaming computers sit alongside equipment rusted with age. Exposed wires run along walls and paint peels from the ceiling. `` It's kind of ironic,'' said <PERSON> Colleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Flood </PERSON>, a bacteriologist who runs the program that tests newborns for presence of the AIDS-related human immunovirus -LRB- HIV -RRB-. `` We're down here doing work that's at the forefront. When people come in here ... they say, ` How can you work in such a dilapidated lab?''' Flood and her colleagues have learned to adjust to a job that brings with it certain measures of pride and indignity. They took the job partly because it is more exciting than routine lab work, but they deal with a disease that still comes with a taint and work in conditions that ca n't match private labs. Virtually any testing needed to combat a public health emergency in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> eventually finds its way to the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Avenue Laboratory here, said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Berns </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> division of clinical sciences. When medical waste began washing up on beaches last summer, it was bagged and sent to <PERSON> Berns </PERSON> for examination. When there was an outbreak of salmonella in eggs, they were brought to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>. AIDS is overwhelmingly the state's most pressing health epidemic. It had 20,476 confirmed cases by the end of 1988, one-fourth the national total, and some 300,000 New Yorkers are thought to be infected with the related HIV virus, a possible precursor of acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The state conducts nearly 750,000 AIDS-related tests a year here, including a half-million HIV tests. That's more than any other laboratory anywhere, <PERSON> Berns </PERSON> said. The military conducts more than 600,000 HIV tests a year at a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> lab. Hundreds of blood vials a day are delivered by mail to the laboratory, where they're placed in a black bin for sorting. Each vial is assigned a number and information about the test subject is typed into a computer. Of the 138 laboratory employees, 20 deal exclusively with AIDS testing. Five white freezers hum in one of many small rooms. Each contains 20,000 blood serum samples, part of the state's research stockpile. Each sample taken since the beginning of the AIDS epidemic is kept here as a ready resource for tests done on the disease. The freezers stand next to a rusted sink covered with a cardboard sign: `` Do not use sink. No drain.'' It's one of dozens of little reminders of the building's limitations The elevators were installed before the Roaring'20s. The ovens where glass was made for test tubes and beakers have been dormant for years, so outdated the equipment is n't safe, said <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> <PERSON> Toombs </PERSON>, the lab's operations director. Mold sometimes grows on the ceilings, said researcher <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoonmaker </PERSON>. Lights occasionally flicker and bulbs have exploded during power surges. <PERSON> Schoonmaker </PERSON> was one of 15 workers who tested positive in 1983 for exposure to tuberculosis, one of many viruses tested there. Each worker was treated with antibiotics for a year and none developed the disease. But it scared them. `` It's frustrating to me,'' <PERSON> Berns </PERSON> said of the building. `` It's a real problem to have to deal with this. But the quality of the people make up for a lot of the problems you have.'' Flood, 28, said her fiance, a high school teacher, did n't want her to take the lab job because of fears about the AIDS virus. Neither did her parents. `` After a while they figured that I was intelligent enough to know that if there was any risk involved then I would n't take it,'' she said. <PERSON> Rosalyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, who also tests blood samples for AIDS, said she thinks twice about telling acquaintances what she does. Usually she just tells them she works in a laboratory, without going into specifics. The employees are strict about wearing rubber gloves and white coats and say they do n't worry too much about the danger. But like their superiors, they'd like a better place to work. `` With <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state and all its wealth, it seems they could provide a little better working atmosphere,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Neal </PERSON>, a bacteriologist. There's never been an accident involving the AIDS virus, <PERSON> Berns </PERSON> said. The HIV virus is not `` a hardy virus,'' and quickly dies when exposed to air. He would n't characterize the building as dangerous, `` but I also would be dishonest if I did n't say the potential for accidents is far higher here.'' Modern laboratories are sealed so germs ca n't escape from floor to floor. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>'s ventilation system is less modern _ windows are opened, often in the winter because of inconsistent heating _ and it's believed this contributed to the TB virus exposure six years ago, <PERSON> Berns </PERSON> said. Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> has called the lab `` obsolete, deteriorating and incapable of meeting modern federal standards for biosafety,'' and asked the Legislature for $ 75 million to rebuild it and six other buildings, all built before 1949. Few people dispute that the building needs to be replaced, `` it's just a question of staying with it,'' said state Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON>, who sponsored legislation to appropriate the money. The bill is still pending. Designs have already been drawn up for the new lab. They're outside <PERSON> Berns </PERSON>' office, awaiting the governmental go-ahead But money is tight in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> this year, with <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> saying he had to deal with a potential $ 2.6 billion deficit as he prepared a budget proposal for the fiscal year that began April 1. `` You stretch a rubber band as far as you can,'' <PERSON> Berns </PERSON> said. `` This rubber band has been stretched to the point of breaking.''

<TEXT>
 A fighter plane that combines long-range supersonic cruise capability with a greatly enhanced ability to dogfight at and above the speed of sound has long been an elusive dream of aircraft designers. After 5 -LCB- years of research the solution to that engineering enigma may be near at <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Langley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, where aeronautical visionaries believe they have seen the future in something called the `` vortex flap.'' The flap, with a distinctive, sharp downward angle, is designed to improve the agility of swept-wing jets. Highly swept wings assure the speed needed for sustained supersonic flight, but unswept wings are preferable for the lift necessary for combat maneuvers and short takeoffs and landings. The vortex flap `` would give you the best of both worlds,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a 30-year veteran of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> who is flight project engineer for the vortex flap experiment. The acute deflection of the wing's leading edge purposely detaches the airflow over the wing and forms a tornado-like vortex on the flap. This creates a suction that reduces drag _ the force that resists an object's movement through the air _ during high-speed maneuvering. `` This is a way to allow swept-wing airplanes to maneuver better,'' said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who has worked on X-15 rocket planes, the YF-12 interceptor from which the SR-71 Blackbird reconnaissance plane was derived, and the FA-18 fighter. With the vortex flap, maneuverability would be significantly increased at speeds of .8 to 1.2 Mach, where most dogfighting is done, he said. Flight tests with a delta-wing F-106B test aircraft, have found the greatest reduction of drag _ 20 percent to 30 percent _ at .9 <ORGANIZATION> Mach </ORGANIZATION>. With reduced drag, a plane would need less thrust. The payoff would be a smaller, lighter engine and a plane that could faster and farther on less fuel. Such planes would not require afterburners needed by today's fighters to reach and maintain supersonic flight, but which guzzle fuel. `` Fighters today concentrate on maneuvering,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` They are not aerodynamically efficient in supersonic speeds and do n't have appreciable supersonic endurance.'' He said the vortex flap could be used on the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s F-14 fighter and the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s F-111 and B-1 bombers, which have wings that can be swept back. It could not be used on the more conventional F-15, F-16 and FA-18 fighters. Another application would be on swept-wing supersonic transports like the French-British Concorde or the American SST project that was canceled in 1971 because of its cost and noise, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. That `` is n't our main focus but it would benefit from our research. The vortex flap would translate into noise reduction'' because of smaller engines and lack of afterburners, he said. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> research pilot <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said the first flight of the F-106B with the vortex flap last Aug. 2 was about what he expected. `` I was thinking it probably would be reasonably well-behaved because we had done high-speed taxi tests. It turned out it was better than predicted. The simulator was a lot harder to fly,'' said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> fighter pilot. Some flight stability was lost by adding the flap to the F-106B, a 1960s vintage fighter, but the plane is only slightly more demanding to fly than without the flap, he said. Flight testing will continue for another 1 -LCB- years. It follows five years of study encompassing nearly 3,000 hours of wind tunnel tests. A fighter with supersonic endurance and transsonic maneuvering ability would have a clear edge, said <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> engineer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hallissy </PERSON>, the principal investigator of the flap. `` It would be able to get to a target faster and the enemy would have less response time ... `` If you can fly faster than the other guy, you can catch him if he's running from you, and he ca n't catch you. The more speed you can sustain the better off you are.''

<HEAD>Scientists Turn From Ancient Bones To Modern Crimes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW BEDFORD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Ubelaker </PERSON> used to examine skeletons for clues to the way people lived thousands of years ago. Now he's trying to figure out from bodies found along highways how eight women died just months ago. Using calipers to measure bones and clay to reconstruct faces, the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> anthropologist brought here by a frustrated prosecutor has helped identify the victims, women between ages 25 and 36 with histories of drug use or prostitution. A ninth body was sent to Ubelaker last week. His work has not led to the arrest of a suspected serial killer. But he may have cleared an innocent man: Sources close to the investigation say his conclusion that two of the women were murdered between mid-summer and late fall led prosecutors to rule out a suspect who had been in jail on other charges. An expert in the emerging field of forensic anthropology, Ubelaker, 42, is one of about 40 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> anthropologists who work regularly with police, applying knowledge of ancient skeletons to the grisly business of solving murders. `` Anthropologists like myself spend their careers looking at the bones of people who lived long ago, trying to figure out what diseases they had, how tall they were, who they were related to, what problems they had, how well they were adapted to their environment,'' he said. `` It turns out, though, that the techniques that we use to study these past populations are the same as those needed to analyze modern remains in criminal cases.'' Few anthropologists are willing to make the switch from cold science to cold blood, which takes `` tremendous intestinal fortitude'' as well as keen observational skills, said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Birkby </PERSON>, a professor of forensic anthropology at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Birkby </PERSON>, a pioneer in the field, got hooked when police found a decomposed body and took it to a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> laboratory in 1962. At first, he was repulsed by the body, which was `` so ripe the officers could n't put it in their car; they wrapped it in a plastic bag and tied it to the bumper.'' He and other graduate students boiled the remains to the bone, carefully measured the skeleton, and concluded it was a young woman, who had apparently been murdered. <PERSON> Birkby </PERSON> does n't remember if the killer was caught; he does recall thinking, `` This is real detective work.'' In cases in which a body is found mostly intact, police usually call in a forensic pathologist, a physician trained in crime-solving techniques. But if the body has decomposed and little is left but a skeleton, they increasingly turn to someone with a doctorate in physical anthropology. `` Other people may be better with flesh, but when it comes to bones, we're the experts,'' said Professor <PERSON> Alison </PERSON> <PERSON> Galloway </PERSON>, a forensic anthropologist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>. Forensic anthropologists can measure the width of pelvic bones to determine sex, use microscopic pieces of a thigh bone to calculate age, and make a clay model of a face based on the shape of the skull. Dental records still are one of the surest ways to identify a body, but they often are not available. So Birkby and others developed skull-photo superimposition, in which they project a photograph of a missing person onto a skull to see whether it fits. Although many Americans have mixed blood, <PERSON> Galloway </PERSON> said, it often is possible to determine race _ black, white or <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> _ from the shape of the skull, teeth and leg bones. Blacks, for example, tend to have projecting jaw bones and ridges above the eyes. Whites have receding cheek bones and narrow noses, and Asians have shovel-shaped incisors and more curved leg bones. A careful examination of a skeleton often reveals not only the type of murder weapon but also its precise characteristics. In a previous <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> case, <PERSON> Ubelaker </PERSON> told police he was nearly certain, from some oddly chipped rib bones, that a young woman had been killed by a long-bladed knife with a bent tip. A knife matching that description was later found near the murder scene. Calculating when a person died is often trickier, involving rough estimates of the rate of decay based on the body's location and exposure to moisture, sun and animals, <PERSON> Galloway </PERSON> said. In about 15 percent of the cases referred to him by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Ubelaker </PERSON> said, the remains are n't even human _ they are bones from dogs or deer, oddly melted pieces of plastic, or something else.

<HEAD>Researchers Try To Develop Artificial Oyster Reefs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Marine researchers hoping to boost oyster production in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> are experimenting with reefs of coal ash and cement. Oyster fishermen used to dump the shells back into the water, providing a nice hard bed that the oysters could anchor to, but they since discovered there was a market for the shells in road-building and calcium supplements. `` If the baby oyster falls on something hard, then he attaches to it and forms a shell; if he fall on the mud bottom, then he dies,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutchinson </PERSON>. The utility, which has a steady supply of ash, is working with <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and state agencies on an aggregate of ash and cement mixed and molded into baseball-sized pellets. Clusters of pellets form the reefs. Adult oysters were put into four ponds with artificial reefs several weeks ago. Results may not come for a year, the time it takes for oysters to mature. But in a study in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, `` we saw no difference in mortality in oyster growth or ash and concrete versus oyster growth on clam shells,'' said <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>, associate dean of marine studies at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION>. Preliminary figures also indicate the artificial beds could be cheaper than buying clam shells, which are dredged from lakes <LOCATION> Pontchartrain </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Maurepas </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> _ a practice decried by environmentalists. <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> $ 150,000 last year putting clam shells in the Gulf and $ 12,500 on oyster shells, Price said. Researchers expect the aggregate to cost $ 9 to $ 10 per ton, compared with $ 15 a ton for shells, <PERSON> Hutchinson </PERSON> said. `` If we ca n't beat the price of the clam shells, then we've priced ourselves out of the market.

<TEXT>
 Money may not buy happiness, but a study suggests that it certainly can reduce stress. <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, a psychology professor at <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mellon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, analyzed the results of a <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> telephone survey of 960 men and 1,427 women aged 18 or older. The Harris pollsters used a Perceived Stress Scale developed by <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> and colleagues. They found that stress tends to decrease as age and household income increase, <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. `` There's a nice relationship between income and stress level. Generally, the lower your income, the higher your stress level. The more money you make, the less stress you report ... The people who seem to be best off are in the $ 45,000 to $ 50,000 a year range.'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>'s scale measures how much stress people feel based on their answers to multiple choice questions about how often they experience certain thoughts and feelings. One key question asks: `` In the last month, how often have you felt difficulties were piling up so high that you could not overcome them?'' `` The scale makes some assumptions about what stress really is,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. `` Stress is when you're overloaded and you feel you ca n't deal with the demands in your life. What you think and feel is really what matters.'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> used <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>'s scale to conduct the survey for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prevention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Promotion </ORGANIZATION> in 1983. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> gave <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> acess to the data about two years later, and he analyzed the results for nearly three years. He found that women tend to feel more stress than men; professionals and managers report less stress than blue-collar workers; the more educated people are, the less stress they report; white people report less stress than blacks; People who are married or living with a mate and those whose spouse died are less stressed than those who are single, divorced or separated. Those who reported more stress in the study also reported more symptoms of illness and went to the doctor and smoked more often, <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. Married people tended to be healthier than non-married people.

 The government said its chief economic forecasting gauge took a 0.7 percent nosedive in March, marking the first back-to-back declines in more than a year in a portent of progressive weakening in the economy. Analysts said the performance thus far of the Index of Leading Economic Indicators is another sign that the economy is losing steam and that the slowdown will become more pronounced later this year. Should the index point downward again for April, that would make three declines in a row, the traditional signal of a forthcoming recession.

 A number of religious groups are creating their own versions of the Yellow Pages telephone directories that exclude business owners who do n't belong to the faith, arousing complaints of discrimination. The Christian Pages, for example, looks like a slimmer version of the commercial advertising directories published by the regional phone companies and other publishers. It follows the usual format of yellow newsprint and black-and-red type. `` The Christian Pages directory is designed to assist born-again Christians in locating members of the Body of Christ should you desire to do business with one another,'' the guide's introduction says. The welcome invokes Galatians 6:10, a New Testament verse that reads: `` As we therefore have opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially those who are of the household of faith.'' `` There's definitely a demand and a need for it,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hover </PERSON>, who has published the 75,000-circulation phone book for 300 <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> churches since 1980. `` For me, this is a ministry. It's a way for me to serve the Lord and be a blessing to the Christian community.'' Advertisers are required to sign a statement of faith in Christ, <PERSON> Hover </PERSON> said. Business owners professing other faiths are refused space. `` Anybody who's truly a Christian obviously has very high standards,'' he said, adding that recent scandals involving evangelists have n't hurt business. `` There's an advantage to doing business with a person who truly believes.'' But others see such directories as a way of shutting out those who are n't seen as believers. `` There's no doubt that anything that's an exclusive listing is divisive to the public,'' said <PERSON> Elliot </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, senior vice president for programs at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christians </ORGANIZATION> and Jews in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` I happen to be a Methodist and we put out a catalogue. But it's stuff that Methodist churches need. `` Other than those kinds of approaches, our position is it's just not a neighborly thing to do. The Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith views Hover's work more as a curse than a blessing, said <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON>, assistant legal affairs director at the Jewish group's <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, headquarters. `` We think that simply by advertising in that grouping, they're sending a very powerful ` Buy Christian' message _ and that we find unacceptable,'' she said A Christian directory in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> went bankrupt in 1977 after a judge awarded damages to two Jewish businessmen who sued after being denied advertising space, <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON> said. That guide violated <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s civil rights act, which bans religious-based trade conspiracies, <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and most other states lack such specific laws, she said. Owners of some Jewish business directories have been warned against overstepping their bounds, <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON> said. Most advertise only items used in religious observances. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lobenthal </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Anti-Defamation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> director, said he objects to `` an innuendo in this sort of advertising that nobody is honest or reputable unless they are born-again Christians.'' `` Some of the solicitations are absurd,'' <PERSON> Lobenthal </PERSON> said. `` No one's ever been able to persuade me that there's anything religious about a tune-up.'' The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION> has n't grappled with the issue of religious business directories, said <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Fouke </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the New York-based group. Baltimore-based Shepherd's Guide, which publishes Christian directories from <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, is the Christian Pages' latest competition in the battle for believers' profits. Other religious organizations target buyers instead of sellers. Michigan-based <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consumers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> promises its 14,000 members `` Christian buying power.'' Churches and families pay $ 586 for a 20-year membership, President <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Amster </PERSON> said. In exchange, the organization hunts for the lowest price on everything from mattresses to marriage counseling. `` As a group, we can negotiate better prices,'' <PERSON> Amster </PERSON> said. `` I think it's very demeaning for a minister to go into a furniture showroom and haggle.'' In 1988, the group served as a go-between for more than $ 6 million worth of transactions, he said. `` We're treated differently,'' <PERSON> Amster </PERSON> said. `` It's not because we're Christians. It's because we spend $ 6 million a year.''

<HEAD>Purchasing Managers Say April Economic Growth Rose Modestly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's economy continued to grown in April at a somewhat faster pace than in March, but at about the same rate as in the first quarter, the nation's purchasing managers said in a report for release today. The levels of production and new orders both registered increases last month after posting declines in the rate of growth in March, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Purchasing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>. Inventory buying did not fuel the pace of the growth, as inventories declined for the fourth consecutive month, said the group, based in <LOCATION> Tempe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>. New export orders increased at the highest rate since December, after registering three consecutive months of lower rates of growth Of the 67 percent of the members who said they export, 28 percent reported better export orders in April, up sharply from 22 percent in both February and March. The 4 percent who reported lower export orders is down sharply from the 9 percent who said so in March. `` The economy entered the second quarter on a higher note than it ended the first quarter,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bretz </PERSON>, chairman of the industry group. `` A surprising increase in new export orders appears to have fueled the brisk rebound from March's sharply lower growth. Nevertheless, most other indicators signal a moderate rate of growth in the economy in the months ahead,'' he said in a statement. The group's Purchasing Managers' Index climbed to 53 percent in April, a healthy increase from 50.4 percent in March. This was the 33rd consecutive month this leading indicator registered over 50 percent. A reading above 50 percent indicates the economy is generally expanding; below 50, the economy is generally contracting. <PERSON> Bretz </PERSON> said the index averaged 52.4 percent in the first four months of 1989. If that average continues the rest of the year, it would be consistent with real rate of growth in gross national product of about 2.5 percent, he said.

 Two dots converge on a computer screen in the cockpit and a voice warns `` climb, climb'' in a mandatory anti-collision system planned for the nation's airliners. The little round computer screen to be added to airliner cockpits, with its ping-pong-ball images and its limited vocabulary, may not look like much to a generation numbed by <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> computer games. But `` TCASII'' is the latest acronym in aviation safety. At more than $ 100,000 each, the second generation of the Traffic Alert Collision Avoidance System is also the latest pricey option for the corporate jet. The system allows pilots to see the proximity of up to 30 aircraft around them, warns verbally when one gets too close and even announces in a computer voice exactly what the pilots should do to avoid a collision: `` climb, climb'' or `` descend, descend.'' The collision avoidance system operates independently of ground-based <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> operations and would serve as a backup to warn pilots of any problem that might be missed by the controller. Attention has been focused on possible midair collisions recently, with nine operational errors involving close-flying aircraft handled by a major southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> facility which brought <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> warnings last week and reports of two near misses by airliners flying over <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Only the smallest planes, with no radar beacons to show their location, would be invisible to the new system. In a recent demonstration in the skies over northern <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Sabreliner </ORGANIZATION> 65 piloted by <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Littlejohn </PERSON>, flight operations director for <ORGANIZATION> TCAS </ORGANIZATION> manufacturer Bendix-King, came within a quarter mile horizontally and 600 feet vertically of an oncoming Beechcraft Baron that was part of the demonstration. Passengers inside the plane saw the Baron flash by after <PERSON> Littlejohn </PERSON> followed the voice command and climbed several hundred feet for a safe separation. `` Once you fly with it, you do n't want to fly without it,'' said M. Ace Card, Bendix-King program manager for <ORGANIZATION> TCAS </ORGANIZATION>, who was aboard the Sabreliner. Systems built by <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> tested successfully in two <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> planes, according to pilot <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Buley </PERSON>. `` For the most part, the results turned out to be more than acceptable to the crews that will have to use the system day to day,'' <PERSON> Buley </PERSON> said in a report for a trade publication. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has required installation of <ORGANIZATION> TCASII </ORGANIZATION> in all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airliners built to carry more than 30 passengers by the end of 1991. Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Packard </PERSON>, R-Calif., introduced a bill last week to phase in the installation starting with 25 percent of each airline's fleet by the end of 1990, 50 percent a year later and the rest by the end of It would order the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to analyze operation of the system in the first year in case any changes are needed. But airline industry officials say they need at least until the end of 1994 to install the systems in 4,500 domestic airliners. More than 1,200 foreign airliners that fly <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> skies also would be required to have the anti-collision device. `` The timetable's too tight,'' said <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Neale </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents the airline industry. `` We've got so much going on that the airlines do n't feel they can get all the planes done in that time without tremendous disruptions in service.'' He noted pending requirements to replace parts on aging airliners, a law that orders installation of equipment to warn against strong wind changes around airports, increases in air travel and a limited number of airline mechanics to do the work. `` We think you need to crawl before you can run,'' <PERSON> Neale </PERSON> said, adding that no test of the system has determined what will happen when large numbers of airliners, all with the units filling their cockpits with a chorus of traffic advisories, are flying in the same area. `` You might get a domino effect,'' he said. <PERSON> Neale </PERSON> said the airlines support the idea of phasing in the systems and having a one-year test period. But he said they would oppose the bill, which is to be the subject of a congressional hearing on Thursday, if it requires full installation by the end of 1993. Carriers have begun placing orders for the anti-collision system with three manufacturers competing in a potentially $ 700 million market: <ORGANIZATION> Allied-Signal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Bendix-King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avionics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and the <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> divisions of <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>. New orders are expected to be announced within the next few days, according to industry sources. The TCASII system consists of a sophisticated transponder that has already been installed on some aircraft, antennae, and a computer that analyzes and displays the movement of nearby planes. The transponder sends out a signal to other aircraft as well as ground controllers. `` The system has no bugs,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodgen </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION>. If two computers meet, he said, orders to the pilots will be reconciled automatically: if one plane is told to climb, the other will be advised to descend or stay on course. While industry experts believe TCASII with its `` climb'' and `` descend'' commands offers enough to prevent nearly all midair collisions, an even more complex system has been developed, <LOCATION> TCASIII </LOCATION>, that also will include horizontal capabilities. <PERSON> Dodgen </PERSON> said that even though <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> is testing such a system on an <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> airliner, it is not likely to be approved for installation on commercial planes for several years, and then only on models off the assembly line, since it would require major modification for older airliners.

 A coal company seeking more than $ 42 million in refunds on <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> state taxes it paid for mining operations on the Navajo and Hopi Indian reservations lost a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> appeal today.

State courts rejected those arguments after finding that the taxes imposed no burden on the tribes. Under lease agreements, Peabody mines coal from <LOCATION> Navajo </LOCATION> tribal land at the <LOCATION> Kayenta </LOCATION> Mine and from the Navajo-Hopi joint-use tribal land at the Black Mesa Mine. Virtually all of the coal mined at the two sites is sold to electric power consortiums under contracts that reimburse Peabody for all state privilege taxes it pays.

But the company's lawsuit against the state and its <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> sought refunds for taxes paid from 1980 through 1985 under protest.

<HEAD>Eds: Inserts 6 grafs of reaction after 18th graf, Knight-Ridder</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to review a challenge to the partial merger of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s two daily newspapers. The justices said they will judge the validity of former Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s decision to allow the newspapers to form a joint operating agreement. A decision is not expected until sometime in 1990. The partial merger is being challenged by a group of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> readers and advertisers. The federal Newspaper Preservation Act of 1970 law authorizes the attorney general to give financially failing newspapers an exemption from federal antitrust laws. Under the joint operating agreement, The <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> and The Detroit News would combine their business, advertising and production departments but maintain separate news and editorial staffs. The high court, by a 7-2 vote, cleared the way for the deal March 20 when it set aside an earlier postponement ordered by Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>. Only Justices <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> voted in March to continue the postponement. But it takes the votes of four justices to grant review to a formal appeal. After the March vote, lawyers for the newspapers said they would await the outcome of the formal appeal, which was acted on today. A federal appeals court panel here voted 2-1 last January to uphold <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s decision to allow the partial merger. The full appeals court split 5-4 last February in refusing to review the three-judge panel's ruling. Opponents to the joint operating agreement, calling themselves <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Citizens for an <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, contend that the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, owned by <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, is not a failing newspaper even though it lost $ 10 million a year between 1981 and 1986. The opponents say the Free Press and News, which lost $ 50 million in the same period, were unprofitable solely because both papers cut prices in an unsuccessful effort to force each other out of business. `` The losses the papers have suffered are the product of vigorous competition,'' said the appeal acted on today. It contended that the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> deal `` threatens the independence of papers in the 25 cities that have competing dailies, since it provides a roadmap for profitable papers to obtain a <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION>, and the monopoly profits that can be obtained in a non-competitive market.'' But in urging the justices to reject the challenge, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration lawyers cited the `` variety of considerations'' that went into <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s decision. `` A newspaper in another city could hardly use this case as a guide for obtaining the attorney general's approval for a <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION>,'' the government lawyers said. <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the News, is the nation's largest newspaper publishing group. <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> is the second largest. <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> has said it might close the Free Press if the joint operating agreement is not consummated. `` This process has been an extraordinary lesson in patience,'' Free Press Publisher <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> said after the court acted today. `` The people of the Free Press have already waited more than three years to assure this newspaper's future. `` I remain confident that what is at stake is vital to the people of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, and confident that what is proposed is fully justified.'' News Publisher <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Giles </PERSON> referred calls for comment to <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, where spokeswoman <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON> declined comment. `` We're delighted,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Vladeck </PERSON>, attorney for Public Citizen, an advocacy group that handled the legal work on the challenge to the business agreement. Public Citizen had not only argued the agreement would threaten newspaper competition in other cities but that a lower court's ruling had set precedents for administrative law that would greatly restrict judicial review of executive actions `` I suspect that the fact that this case presented both issues made it doubly appealing to the court,'' <PERSON> Vladeck </PERSON> said. Under the 100-year agreement, the News would receive 55 percent of the merged company's profits during the first year but that percentage would drop to 50 percent by the seventh year. Thereafter, the profits would be evenly divided. The case is <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Citizens For an <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, 88-1640.

Under a three-year agreement, <PERSON> Dreyer </PERSON>'s will manufacture <ORGANIZATION> Ben </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON>'s products at Dreyers' <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, plant using <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> dairy products. <PERSON> Dreyer </PERSON>'s, an Oakland-Calif. - based company, makes and distributes ice cream and other dairy-based products, including <ORGANIZATION> Ben </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON>'s in <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and By 1992, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said, about 3.5 million gallons of ice cream will be produced in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>; the Waterbury-based company currently sells 5 million gallons annually, and projects it will be selling 8 million gallons a year by 1992. The company currently operates two <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> plants, one in <LOCATION> Waterbury </LOCATION> and one in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Waterbury </LOCATION> plant, built in 1985, produces ice cream in pint packages and bulk ice cream for franchise shops. The <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> plant makes ice cream novelties. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said it would not be economically feasible for the company to convert parts of the plant for producing pints. Since partners <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenfield </PERSON> opened shop in an old filling station in <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> in 1978, <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> & amp; <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON>'s has grown into a $ 40 million corporation. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said the company is not moving any of its <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> operations to <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>.

 A sharply divided <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled today the burden is on employers to disprove sexual stereotyping when they are accused of discriminating against women. By a 6-3 vote, the justices ordered further lower court hearings in a suit against the accounting firm Price Waterhouse by <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>, who said she was denied a partnership because of `` macho'' attitudes that she did not behave sufficiently ladylike. Today's ruling also is a partial victory for Price Waterhouse. The court overturned a lower court ruling that would have placed an even heavier burden of proof on the company. Moreover, only four of the justices agreed on the standards that should govern lawsuits alleging sexual stereoptyping. The absence of a court majority enunciating clear guidelines is likely to sow confusion among lower courts when deciding such cases. Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, in the court's main opinion, said when someone `` proves that her gender played a motivating part in an employment decision, the defendant may avoid a finding of liability only by proving by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have made the same decision even if it had not taken the plantiff's gender into account.'' Joining his opinion were Justices <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON>. Justice <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, in a separate concurring opinion, agreed that in the case of Price Waterhouse, `` the burden of persuasion should shift to the employer to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have reached the same decision concerning <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>' candidacy absent consideration of her gender.'' But <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said she does not favor `` the strong medicine'' of forcing employers to bear the burden of proof in all such cases. Justice <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> also concurred in today's result. But in a separate opinion he said he would not require an employer to submit `` objective evidence'' to disprove sexual bias in such cases. As long as `` the employer credibly testifies that the action would have been taken for legitimate reasons alone, this should be ample proof,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. The three dissenters are Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> and <PERSON> Justices </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. They voted to kill Ms. <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>' suit. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, in his opinion for the three, said there was ample evidence that Price Waterhouse did not discriminate against her intentionally. Ms. <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> quit Price Waterhouse, one of the nation's so-called `` Big Eight'' accounting firms, after she was denied promotion to partnership in 1983 _ a move that would have made her a part owner. She later became a consultant to the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. In other actions today, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>: _ Agreed to review a challenge to review to the partial merger of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s two daily newspapers The justices said they will judge the validity of former Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s decision to allow the newspapers to form a joint operating agreement. _ Agreed to hear a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration apeal aimed at allowing the government to collect potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes from multinational corporations _ Refused to hear an appeal by <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> officials seeking to recover from asbestos manufacturers the cost of removing the product from public schools in the state In the sex bias case, Ms. <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> had joined Price Waterhouse in 1978 and was nominated for parntership in 1982, the only woman among 88 candidates for partnership that year. She had been very successful in getting business for the company, winning government contracts worth between $ 34 million and $ 44 million. Both her critics and supporters at Price <PERSON> Watershouse </PERSON> said she sometimes was overly agreessive, too harsh, impatient with her staff and very demanding. One critic suggested she needed to take a `` course at charm school.'' A partner who supported her for promotion told her she would stand a better chance of getting ahead if she would `` walk more femininely, talk more femininely, dress more femininely, wear make-up, have her hair styled and wear jewelry.'' Ms. <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> sued Price Waterhouse on grounds it violated Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibiting on-the-job discrimination. She said sexual stereotyping, unconscious or otherwise, cost her a partnership. Professinal partnerships are covered by the 1964 law under a 1984 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> here ruled in 1987 that while there appeared to be mixed motives in denying Ms. <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> a partnership, Price Waterhouse was unable to prove that `` impermissible bias was not the determinative factor'' for the decision. The appeals court said an employer must show by `` clear and convincing evidence'' they did not practice bias. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today did not go that far. The `` clear and convincing'' standard usually means that to successfully defend against a lawsuit, a company must show that the overwhelming evidence is in its favor. By contrast, the `` preponderance'' standard adopted today means Price Waterhouse can win if it can show more than half the evidence is in its favor. The case is Price Waterhouse vs. <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>, 87-1167.

<TEXT>
 Some of the people getting nearly $ 17 an hour to mop up the largest oil spill in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history are unhappy with how the mess is being handled and 20 quit their jobs. `` We do n't even know who our supervisors are,'' said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Christoffersen </PERSON>, who had been staying aboard the USS Juneau. The vessel serves as a floating hotel for the more than 300 clean-up workers laboring _ sometimes one rock at a time _ to get oil off <LOCATION> Smith </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>'s once-picturesque shoreline. <PERSON> Christoffersen </PERSON> was one of 20 workers taken back to <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> during the weekend after quitting. As they lined up to leave, new workers arrived. <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> has been the center of the cleanup since March 24, when the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> went aground in Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> and spilled more than 10 million gallons of crude. The oil, which has spread across hundreds of square miles, during the weekend reached the beaches of Katmai National Park, a brown bear refuge about 275 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>. Authorities said today they are shifting a large clean-up dredge southward from Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> to follow the drifting oil. They also plan to bring in high-powered warm-water guns to cleanse the rugged shoreline. `` Over the last two days ... we've discovered a very large amount of oil debris inside of Shelikof Straits,'' park superintendent <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Bane </PERSON> said. The 30-mile-wide strait lies between <LOCATION> Kodiak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>. `` The impact stretches from <LOCATION> Shaw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, on the north side of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Douglas </LOCATION>, all the way to our southern boundary, and now we've had reports it's been found in <LOCATION> Wild </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, south of us,'' <PERSON> Bane </PERSON> said Today was the deadline for <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> to provide the state with a plan for waste disposal and the cleaning of Gulf of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> shorelines. `` We want to see a documented plan, a well-documented plan, with the equipment and people, showing how they are going to dispose of that oil,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Holian </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION>. `` We want to know what they are going to do with that oily waste.'' `` There is some talk of using a hazardous waste incinerator on a barge brought up from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' she said. `` There are different kinds of incinerators and a hazardous waste incinerator has more safeguards built into it. ... We are trying to safeguard the air quality.'' Meantime, some people like <PERSON> Christoffersen </PERSON> are getting fed up with what they see as an exercise in futility. He also said people are getting bored by being stuck on the ship. An <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> official said any mistakes or confusion were a natural part of getting the vessel into operation. The <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION>, a 569-foot amphibious dock landing ship armed with guns 3 inches in diameter, is anchored at an estimated cost of $ 150,000 a day. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ship arrived last week with more than 1,000 crew and workers aboard. Operations started Thursday, but fizzled Friday when seas rose to 7 feet and winds were to 38 mph. Work resumed Saturday. Several workers remained aboard, unable to go ashore for lack of equipment. One group that labeled itself `` The Forgotten 14'' had not worked since Wednesday. The workers spoke on condition of anonymity. `` They said they would fire us,'' said a 25-year-old fishing guide. He and the others said they were being paid overtime at $ 25 an hour Saturday to do nothing. `` We get paid the same as the people out there working.'' `` I'm here because I do n't know if I'll have a fishing season,'' he said. `` I thought I'd get my money now. I do n't know where my fish are.'' Others complained about the lack of activity. `` At first, the days started out like weeks and now they're like years,'' said one worker. The <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION>'s captain, <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Willandt </PERSON>, said that after the first day, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> reported a section of beach measuring 300-by-45 feet was about 30 percent cleaned. `` They have to go over it at least two more times to get it clean,'' <PERSON> Willandt </PERSON> said The company has promised to clean 300 miles of coastline within <LOCATION> Prince </LOCATION> <LOCATION> William </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION> by Sept. 15. Workers are putting in 12-hour days, working 14 days and getting seven off, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanco </PERSON> said from his office aboard a barge tied alongside the <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Blanco </PERSON>, who is heading the <LOCATION> Smith </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> effort, attributed the complaints to startup problems. `` It was hard the first day. The conditions out here are tough,'' he said. `` It's tough work. He said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> was trying to make the crews happy aboard ship. He said in addition to televisions, the company planned a free store and had paid for double rations of food. `` To have happy campers, you have to feed them well,'' he said.

 The stock market gave ground today, faced with evidence of persistent strength in the economy. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 17.04 points to 2,401.76 by noontime on Wall Street. Losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 2 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 367 up, 909 down and 513 unchanged.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today refused to hear <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s appeal of a federal court ruling that the company infringed on instant film and camera patents held by <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> argued that the 1985 ruling should be thrown out because <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Rya </PERSON> <PERSON> Zobel </PERSON>, who presided over the trial, had a conflict of interest in the case A federal appeals court that earlier heard <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>'s appeal noted that <PERSON> Zobel </PERSON> announced to both companies in 1981 that her mother-in-law owned <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> shares and that <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> raised no objection. The appeals court said that it was not until 1988, well after <PERSON> Zobel </PERSON>'s liability ruling against <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>, that the company objected. Since the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> refuses to hear the case, the federal appeal's court ruling against <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> is the final word. In <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, opening arguments began today in the trial to determine the damages <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> must pay <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>. By copying <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s technology, <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> forced its rival to sell some cameras below cost and enormously damaged the instant photography market, <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> lawyers said. The trial before Judge <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazzone </PERSON> in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION> is expected by many securities analysts to result in <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> paying Polaroid about $ 1 billion, which would be the largest patent damage award in history. The trial is expected to take four to six months. `` You start talking and I'll start listening, and as the famous saying goes, I hope you finish before I do,'' <PERSON> Mazzone </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> lawyers. <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> argued that <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> was entitled to $ 3.9 billion in lost profits because of <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>'s sales of instant cameras and film between 1976 and 1986. In addition, <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> argued that <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> is entitled to interest and triple punitive damages, bringing the total to just under $ 12 billion. In a previous trial, a judge ruled in October 1985 that <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> had violated seven of <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s key patents on instant film and cameras _ and booted <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> out of the instant photography business, saddling it with $ 600 million of losses and an estimated $ 200 million worth of useless manufacturing equipment. The only issue in the current trial is the value of the damage caused by <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, N.Y.-based <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> argues that the most Polaroid should get is $ 177 million, representing a 5 percent royalty on all the instant film and cameras that <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> sold from 1976 to 1986. Lawyers said the record award in a patent infringement lawsuit was approximately $ 200 million that <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> received from <ORGANIZATION> Dresser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> in 1986. A multibillion-dollar verdict could force <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> to make layoffs, take on huge debt and sell subsidiaries to raise cash. It could leave the company unable to make the investments it needs to compete with Japanese film makers. If the award is near the top of the possible range, it could even force <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> into a Chapter 11 bankruptcy, just as <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> was forced to reorganize when a jury ordered it to pay $ 10.3 billion to <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> four years ago. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> emerged from Chapter 11 a year ago after paying <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> $ 3 billion in cash to settle the case. But securities analysts say a Chapter 11 filing is unlikely. Most Wall Street brokerage houses are predicting an award of about $ 1 billion, and traders say the stock prices of both companies already reflect that expectation. `` We're not going to see another <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> here,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Enderlin </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Polaroid, which recently spent $ 1.1 billion to buy back stock and fend off a hostile takeover by <ORGANIZATION> Shamrock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, is expected to use part of any award to lower its corporate debt <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said he reckoned <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s stock price probably will rise or fall about $ 1 for every $ 100 million of the award that is above or below Wall Street's expectations.

 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> is expected to raise its production quota in June to help return bloated prices to the cartel's $ 18-a-barrel target level, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s oil minister said Monday The Middle East Economic Survey quoted <PERSON> Issam </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul-Rahim </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Chalabi </PERSON> as saying that an increase in the output ceiling should end overproduction by some of the organization's 13 members. <PERSON> Chalabi </PERSON> said that the increase is expected to be formalized at a June meeting of <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> ministers and take effect in the second half of the year. A new output level has not been decided, the minister said. However, industry observers expect an increase of about 1.5 million barrels a day. Last November, the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> set a production quota of 18.5 million barrels a day in an effort to raise world oil prices, which had fallen to $ 10 to $ 12 a barrel. At the time, the cartel was producing in excess of 22 million barrels, far more than the market could absorb. Since then, oil prices have nearly doubled, although several <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members are producing above their quotas, putting the cartel above its self-imposed limit. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> does not want to see prices too high lest they encourage non-OPEC producers to increase production. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> have both demanded higher quotas and the U.A.E. has consistantly been overproducing since November, oil sources have reported. <PERSON> Chalabi </PERSON> warned, however, that there could be no going back on the principle of equal quotas for <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> which fought an eight-year war ending in cease-fire last August. He said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> will not even discuss the matter. `` We watch very closely whatever production figures come out of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` If in actual terms there is going to be any production increase or quota violation by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, then that will be treated differently by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Chalabi </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s current refining capacity is 600,000 barels a day and internal consumption is running at about 300,000 barrels a day.

 Voters' rejection of Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>'s tax plan will mean the likely closures of hospitals and universities and the layoffs of thousands of state employees, the governor said today `` We do n't have all the specifics yet. We'll let you know as soon as we can,'' an obviously weary <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> told reporters at an impromptu news conference. The governor was closeted late into the night Sunday with advisers to decide how to approach a budget that is now $ 700 million short of balance for the new fiscal year beginning July 1. Voters on Saturday rejected the plan by 55 percent to 45 percent, according to unofficial returns. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>, who traveled around the state for six weeks trying to to sell the plan, faces questions about his political future just 13 months after he took office as a reformer promising a `` new <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>.'' `` I'm not worried about that. I'm concerned about this state,'' <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> said, fielding questions on the Capitol steps. `` There will be a referendum on <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> in 2 -LCB- years.'' <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>'s plan would have shifted the tax burden away from big business, putting more of a load on individuals through the income tax. It would have reduced sales taxes and given businesses incentives to move to <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and expand. The plan also included a $ 1.4 billion program to improve highways, airports and shipping ports, funded by a gasoline tax increase of 4 cents a gallon. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> touted his plan as a way to bring jobs to <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, which has the nation's highest unemployment rate at 9.6 percent, and to end the state's dependence on the oil industry. The oil, gas and chemical industry paid more than half of the state taxes for nearly 50 years until its collapse in 1982. Since then, state government has hovered near bankruptcy. `` I never worked harder in my life to try to turn this around,'' the Democratic governor said. `` We're going to keep building, but not as fast as I wanted to.'' `` This plan will tell <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that we've changed, that we're ready to pay our way,'' <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> said repeatedly during his trips around the state Opponents condemned it as nothing more than a huge tax increase and said <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> had not reduced spending as promised during his 1987 campaign, when he unseated <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>. Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, an outspoken critic of the plan, said its defeat was `` going to make a real change in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>.'' He called on <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> to work with legislators in tightening spending and making major changes in its welfare programs. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, a former <PERSON> Ku </PERSON> <PERSON> Klux </PERSON> <PERSON> Klan </PERSON> leader elected as a Republican to a suburban <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> seat on an anti-tax plank in February, compared the referendum's outcome to his own victory. `` Every day that passes, I'm more and more in awe of the intelligence and the good sense in our state,'' he said. Even with passage of the plan, the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> would have been forced to cut spending by $ 200 million to keep the budget balanced. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> met all day Sunday with his closest advisers on how to cut the budget. `` The people want closures. I really believe that,'' Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Adley </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said as he left the meeting at the governor's mansion. `` They sent us a signal that we have n't done enough. `` It could be from one to several universities or more. Hospitals could be from three to five,'' the Democrat said. `` Right now we're trying to find every way in the world that a degree of services can be rendered.'' <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> has 18 public universities and eight charity hospitals. `` The people sent a signal that they want more cuts,'' added <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON>, <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>'s chief of staff. `` I'm not sure what goes through the minds of citizens when they think of budget cuts. They think of waste, of extras. Unfortunately, to live within the limitations set here, we'll probably have to do more than the average citizen expects.'' <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON> said thousands of the state's 80,000 employees likely would lose their jobs. The administration would determine within a week all specific cuts, he said. `` When you close institutions, that means people lose jobs,'' he said. As for <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>'s political future, political consultant and pollster <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Renwick </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Loyola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> said the governor was `` badly wounded, but not critically wounded.'' <PERSON> Silas </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Loyola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> political scientist, said, `` <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> could n't sell his plan to blue-collar whites, many of whom think <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> is on the ball, and he could n't sell it to blacks, who did n't think there would really be thousands of jobs for them.''

 The oil and gas rig count continued its seesaw pattern, dropping by 16 this week to total 751, <ORGANIZATION> Baker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> reported. Last week, the number of working oil and gas rigs had increased by nine to 767, the company said Monday. A year ago, the count totaled 880. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>' rig count _ the widely watched industry index of drilling activity _ reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs actively producing oil. Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an oil toolmaker company that merged with <ORGANIZATION> Baker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, has kept track of the rig count since 1940. In December 1981 at the height of the oil boom, the rig count reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $ 10 per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in the rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> began compiling figures.

<HEAD>Spending Down Third Month in a Row</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Construction spending, hit by a sharp drop in the highway category, suffered its third consecutive monthly decline in March, the first time building activity has shown such weakness since just before the last recession, the government said Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said that spending on public and private building projects declined by 0.3 percent in March, following even larger declines of 0.8 percent in February and 0.7 percent in January. The February decline represented a sharp revision from the original report a month ago, when the government had reported that construction spending was unchanged from the January level. The three consecutive declines pushed activity down to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 413.5 billion. It marked the longest string of setbacks since five months of declines from February through June of 1981, right before the start of the 1981-82 recession. Construction, because of its sensitivity to high interest rates, has often been one of the sectors leading the country into a downturn. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sumichrast </PERSON>, an economist and publisher of a construction newsletter, said that history could well repeat itself unless the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> soon relents and stops pushing interest rates up in an effort to fight inflation. Economists have been looking for building activity to be weak this year because of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s campaign to push interest rates higher as a way of fighting inflation by dampening economic activity. `` There is no strength anywhere in construction,'' <PERSON> Sumichrast </PERSON> said. `` We have problems with overbuilding, high interest rates and a sharp run-up in prices of single-family homes.'' The weakness in March resulted from a 9.1 percent plunge in public construction, which fell to an annual rate of $ 74.1 billion. Much of that decline reflected an 18.8 percent drop in spending for highways and streets, the biggest government category. Construction of new housing units was down as well, dropping 1.4 percent to an annual rate of $ 143.3 billion. Spending on single-family homes fell by 1.7 percent to an annual rate of $ 120.1 billion while multi-family construction was up 0.9 percent to a rate of $ 23.3 billion. Non-residential construction rose by 4.1 percent to an annual rate of $ 101.9 billion, reflecting strength in factory construction, which surged by 12.1 percent and hotel construction, which was up 7 percent. But <PERSON> Sumichrast </PERSON> said he believed this was a temporary spurt in activity. For the year as a whole, he predicted that construction in the non-residential category would drop by about 6 percent from the 1988 level, led by continued weakness in office construction.

 The stock market retreated today, faced with evidence of persistent strength in the economy. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 12.09 points to 2,406.71 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street. Losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 3 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 497 up, 864 down and 509 unchanged.

 A national highway safety expert was cited for contempt for releasing documents about <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> crash tests that had been sealed in <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Circuit Judge <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wasielewski </PERSON> has ordered that <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Biss </PERSON> pay a $ 2,000 fine for releasing the documents to the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> television network's `` 20-20'' news show. The judge last week ordered that the money be paid to the emergency trauma center at the <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Complex </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Biss </PERSON> formerly was an official with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and now is a private consultant. He was hired as an expert by lawyers representing a man from <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, who is seeking unspecified damages from <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> in a November 1985 car accident that left him a quadriplegic. The accident victim, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON>, says he was seated in the center of the back seat of a 1981 <LOCATION> Chevrolet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chevette </LOCATION> when the car collided head-on with a pickup truck on <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> 69 in <LOCATION> Dane </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON> says he was injured when he was thrust into the front of the car, which was equipped with only two rear seat belts. His lawsuit, scheduled to go to trial Oct. 9, contends that, if he had had a seat belt, he would not have been injured. <PERSON> Biss </PERSON> admitted that he turned over to a producer for the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> news program last summer an internal document from <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> that was under a protective court seal. As an expert witness in the <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON> trial, <PERSON> Biss </PERSON> was allowed to view the document during the period in which lawyers gather information from the other side. The document contained the results of a 1976 test by <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> that it said showed that passengers strapped in rear lap belts undergo four times the force required to cause serious injury in head-on collisions. The `` 20-20'' program used the document in a July 1988 broadcast in which it said <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and other automakers failed to install shoulder belts in the back seats of automobiles, even though the companies knew that shoulder belts were safer than lap belts alone.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s decision Monday to review the partial merger of two <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> newspapers will force <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to determine how much longer it can absorb losses from its <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, analysts said. By agreeing to hear arguments on the proposed joint operating agreement -LRB- JOA -RRB-, the court set the stage for its first review of the 19-year-old Newspaper Preservation Act. A decision is not expected until next year. The <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, owned by <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> agreed in 1986 to merge the newspapers' production, circulation and business operations and to split profits and losses equally for most of the 100-year arrangement <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION>'s president and chief executive officer, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Battn </PERSON>, said the organization would plan over the coming days what to do next. <PERSON> Batten </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> continues `` to believe strongly in the fairness and justice of our case on behalf of a <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION>, through spokeswoman <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, said it was `` reviewing the decision'' and would have no further comment. Both newspapers have been losing money for years, and <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> has said it will close the smaller <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> unless the partial merger goes through. `` <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION>'s decision would be based upon its reading of the length of time and the likelihood ... of this thing happening,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reidy </PERSON>, communications industry analyst with the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> brokerage house <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` Clearly, from their point of view, they would like to eliminate the cash drain of the Free Press. ... On the other hand, if they wait it out, then they'll have half interest in a <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION>, which will earn considerably more for them than the loss last year. So it is a tough decision,'' <PERSON> Reidy </PERSON> said. The Free Press lost $ 18.5 million in 1988, <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> said in court filings earlier this year. <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> has released no annual loss figures for the News, but <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> in testimony has estimated the News' losses at $ 75 million from 1979 through 1987. The newspapers have said closing the Free Press would cost 2,200 jobs while a joint operating agreement would mean a total of 600 to 800 jobs lost at the two papers. Free Press employees at a staff meeting took news of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s decision with a calm patience. `` We've been punched around so many times. It's like, okay, we'll waltz with it again,'' said <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>, a feature writer. The partial merger, designed to retain newspaper competition through an exemption to federal antitrust laws, was approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> last year but was tied up by court challenges from an organization of newspaper readers and advertisers, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Citizens for an <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, and the Washington-based advocacy group <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION>. They argued that the newspapers' losses resulted from management decisions rather than being inherent in the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> media market and that if the deal were approved, any well-off newspaper publishing group could deliberately create conditions for an antitrust exemption. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration attorneys countered that a `` variety of considerations'' had been behind the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s decision. `` A newspaper in another city could hardly use this case as a guide for obtaining the attorney general's approval for a <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION>,'' the government lawyers said. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON>, a lawyer for Public Citizen, predicted far-reaching results from the court's decision to hear arguments. `` It is the first test the court has heard under the Newspaper Preservation Act. It is likely it will decide the meaning of the act and the scope of the act for the future,'' <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON> said. A federal appeals court panel in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> voted 2-1 in January to uphold the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to allow the partial merger. The full appeals court then split 5-4 in February in refusing to review the three-judge panel's ruling. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, by a 7-2 vote, cleared the way for the deal March 20 when it set aside an earlier postponement ordered by Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>. Only Justices <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> voted in March to continue the postponement; the votes of four justices are needed to grant review to a formal appeal. When the court's stay was lifted, <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> proposed proceeding with the partial merger. <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> declined to do so. No stay is in effect, and the newspapers would have the option of merging while awaiting the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s decision on the case. <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, is the nation's largest newspaper publishing group. <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION>, headquartered in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, is the second largest.

 Grain and soybean futures prices rose strongly Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in reaction to long-range forecasts of below-average rainfall in several grain-producing states. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> on Friday released 30 - and 90-day forecasts that predicted a return to dry conditions in the western half of the Farm Belt, including <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> The forecasts fueled talk of a return of drought conditions, pushing up prices across the board. `` It was a very typical weather-related price movement,'' said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>, a grain specialist with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` There is a lot of uncertainty in the market, and the market should reflect that uncertainty into the summer.'' Wheat was strong because of severe weather conditions, and despite continued uncertainty over the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's position on continuing subsidized grain sales to foreign countries Prices were helped by rumors that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration could make a decision soon that would allow the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to purchase up to 3 million metric tons of grain. At the close, wheat was 4 cents to 6 \ cents higher with the contract for delivery in May at $ 4.23 -RCB- a bushel; corn was 4 \ cents to 5 -RCB- cents higher with May at $ 2.74 a bushel; oats were 4 cents to 6 -RCB- cents higher with May at $ 1.84 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 12 -LCB- cents to 17 \ cents higher with May at $ 7.35

<HEAD>Arco Profit Up 76 Percent On Gains From Lyondell Stock Sale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Richfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday its profit rose 76 percent in the first quarter, due largely to gains from the sale of a half interest in its <ORGANIZATION> Lyondell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petrochemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. Without that gain and other one-time charges against earnings, net income in the quarter would have risen only 3.5 percent, said <PERSON> Lodwrick </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Arco </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive officer. For the three-month period ended March 31, <ORGANIZATION> Arco </ORGANIZATION>'s net earnings totaled $ 704 million, or $ 4 per share, up from $ 401 million, or $ 2.20 a share, in the first quarter of 1988. Revenue fell to $ 3.96 billion, down 14 percent from $ 4.61 billion a year earlier. The results included a $ 634 million after-tax gain from the sale of 53.75 percent interest in <ORGANIZATION> Lyondell </ORGANIZATION> in January. <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, who reported the results at the company's annual shareholders meeting, said that discounting one-time gains and charges, profit would have been $ 415 million. The gains were partially offset by $ 345 in after-tax charges for unspecified environmental expenses, anticipated losses on the planned sale of <ORGANIZATION> Arco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Solar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and a charge related to the sale of the company's aluminum operation in 1985. <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> also said that the March oil spill in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, which forced a temporary halt to shipments from the port of <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, cost the company about $ 10 million after taxes. <ORGANIZATION> Arco </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenstein </PERSON> said the loss stemmed from a combination of reduced production and lower oil flow through the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> pipeline over a 12-day period after the March 24 spill. `` About 3.2 million barrels net to <ORGANIZATION> Arco </ORGANIZATION> was not delivered,'' said <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenstein </PERSON>. `` So when you look at reduced deliveries to <ORGANIZATION> Arco </ORGANIZATION> and reduced production _ we had to reduce production in one of our refineries _ the overall after-tax loss was $ 10 million. Most of that relates to loss of delivered crude.''

 Interest rates on short-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> securities fell in Monday's auction. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sold $ 7 billion in three-month bills at an average discount rate of 8.64 percent, down from 8.66 percent last week. Another $ 7 billion was sold in six-month bills at a discount rate which also averaged 8.64 percent, down from 8.72 percent last week. The rates were the lowest since April 17 when three-month bills sold for 8.57 percent and six-month bills averaged 8.59 percent. The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors _ 8.96 percent for three-month bills with a $ 10,000 bill selling for $ 9,781.60 and 9.16 percent for a six-month bill selling for $ 9,563.20. In a separate report, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said Monday that the average yield for one-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills, the most popular index for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, dipped to 9.22 percent last week from 9.28 percent the previous week.

 The stock market gave ground Monday, faced with news suggesting persistent strength in the economy. But after an early selloff, prices recovered much of their losses. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down nearly 20 points in the early going, closed with a minus-3 .84 reading at 2,414.96 Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 7 to 5 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 590 up, 832 down and 528 unchanged.

<HEAD>Dollar Strengthens As Intervention Has Little Impact</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Most European financial markets were closed Monday for a holiday.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar wound up higher against all major currencies in a thin market Monday as an unexpectedly strong economic assessment from the nation's purchasing managers triggered buying. Gold prices barely budged. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a bid of $ 377.45 for a troy ounce of gold at 4 p.m. EDT, 5 cents lower than Friday's late bid. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Polce </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said intervention by a few central banks had little lasting effect on the dollar's movement. Trading volume was light in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Most major European financial markets were closed for a holiday. Individual transactions have more of an impact on exchange rates in a market in which relatively fewer trades are taking place. Foreign exchange dealers attributed part of the dollar's strength to a monthly survey by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Purchasing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, which suggested economic growth regained momentum in April The purchasing managers' index, which measures new orders, production, vendor deliveries, inventory and employment, went up to 53 percent in April after falling to 50.4 percent in March. Last month's growth rate was roughly the same as the first quarter's pace An implication of the purchasing managers' survey was that economic activity may not be slowing enough to induce the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to ease its grip on credit. This would mean interest rates would remain at current levels. Rising interest rates in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this year have enhanced the appeal of dollar-denominated investments. Here are late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with Friday's late rates: 134.125 Japanse yen, up from 133.05; 1.89065 West German marks, up from 1.8810; 1.6870 Swiss francs, up from 1.6755; 6.375 French francs, up from 6.3580; 1,383.25 Italian lire, up from 1,377.00; and 1.18725 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1853 The dollar strengthened against the British pound in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> trading. Sterling was quoted at $ 1.6798, less expensive for buyers than Friday's late rate of $ 1.6855. Gold prices were little changed in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dealings. There were no quotes available from overseas. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold bullion for current delivery edged up to $ 378.20 a troy ounce from Friday's settlement of $ 377.90. Silver bullion for current delivery settled at $ 5.646 a troy ounce on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Comex compared to $ 5.601 on Friday.

 Midwest department store operators <ORGANIZATION> Carson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pirie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and P.A. <PERSON> Bergner </PERSON> announced Monday they have agreed to merge, with <PERSON> Bergner </PERSON> acquiring <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> for about $ 454 million. `` This merger fulfills our long-term objective to have a major presence in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area,'' said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bergner </PERSON>'s chief executive officer and board chairman The announcement wraps up a month-long courtship of Chicago-based <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> that began in mid-April when <PERSON> Bergner </PERSON> made a $ 282 million buyout offer worth about $ 20 a share. That bid was rejected, as was the sweetened offer one week later of $ 24 a share. `` Together, the <PERSON> Bergner </PERSON> family of stores _ <PERSON> Bergner </PERSON>'s, <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Store </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>'s _ will constitute one of the largest department-store operations in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and will be No. 1 in sales,'' said <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, who added the <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>'s stores would continue to operate under the <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> <PERSON> Pirie </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> name. At an afternoon news conference, however, he said some of <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>'s subsidiary stores _ including the <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seat </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Arcadia </LOCATION> stores _ will be offered for sale. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> also said there were no plans to release any of <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>'s employees but that <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Willmott </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>'s chairman and chief executive officer, would resign. <PERSON> Willmott </PERSON> called the linkage of the two retail chains `` the beginning of another stage in the company's ongoing 135-year-old history'' and said it would serve shareholders' best interests. `` It had been my strong personal preference to continue the two-year restructuring program we began in 1987 and to remain an independent, focused retailer,'' said <PERSON> Willmott </PERSON>. The company fended off a 1986 takeover attempt by Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Baytree </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> lost $ 38.8 million in the fiscal year that ended in January, partly because of problems integrating the <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON>'s stores it bought in 1987 in Two years ago, the company finished $ 26.7 million in the red. <PERSON> Willmott </PERSON> said the merger with <PERSON> Bergner </PERSON>'s `` will combine two companies with similar strategic objectives and will give <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>'s and <PERSON> Bergner </PERSON>'s a stronger position in the highly competitive Midwest market <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> <PERSON> Pirie </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>'s valuable name and position in the retail industry will be maintained.'' <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> <PERSON> Pirie </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> operates 33 stores under its own name. They are located in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, central <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, northwest <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. It also operates 391 County Seat specialty stores, mostly in <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Sunbelt </ORGANIZATION> states, and 23 <LOCATION> Arcadia </LOCATION> shops, primarily in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. With the acquisition, <PERSON> Bergner </PERSON>'s _ a Swiss-owned chain that has operated in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> for 100 years and has 33 stores in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> _ will become one of the top 15 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> department-store operations with consolidated revenue of about $ 1 billion. <PERSON> Bergner </PERSON>, owned by the Maus and <PERSON> Nordmann </PERSON> families of <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, has headquarters in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> for its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> holdings. Under the agreement approved by boards of both companies, a <PERSON> Bergner </PERSON>'s subsidiary will begin a tender offer within five business days for all the outstanding <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>'s shares for $ 27.50 each. Based on 16.5 million shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis, the takeover will cost $ 453.75 million.

 Grain and soybean futures prices rose strongly Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in reaction to long-range forecasts of below-average rainfall in several grain-producing states. On other markets, gasoline and crude oil prices rallied; cattle and hogs were up, and gold and silver prices gained moderately. Wheat settled 4 cents to 6 \ cents higher with the contract for delivery in May at $ 4.23 -RCB- a bushel; corn was 4 \ cents to 5 -RCB- cents higher with May at $ 2.74 a bushel; oats were 5 cents to 6 -LCB- cents higher with May at $ 1.84 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 12 -RCB- cents to 17 -RCB- cents higher with May at $ 7.35 \ The increased grain and soybean prices came on the heels of the 30 - and 90-day forecasts released Friday by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which predicted a return to dry conditions in the western half of the Farm Belt, including <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> The forecasts fueled talk of a return of drought conditions, pushing up prices across the board. `` It was a very typical weather-related price movement,'' said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>, a grain specialist with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` There is a lot of uncertainty in the market, and the market should reflect that uncertainty into the summer.'' Wheat finished strong despite doubt over the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's position on continuing subsidized grain sales to foreign countries. <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> noted that a lot of people are questioning the export subsidy program, which finances cheap wheat sales to certain nations, in the light of its costs and the prospect of a poor wheat crop. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Monday that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will soon have a decision of a new grain sale to the Soviets. Petroleum prices on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> closed mixed in light trading because of the May Day holiday celebrated in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. Crude oil and gasoline moved up as buyers took advantage of lower prices, while heating oil prices dropped in a selloff. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritterbusch </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Carson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said traders who sold their gasoline contracts last week were buying the fuel and selling heating oil, betting that gasoline prices would rise. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 12 cents to 24 cents higher with June at $ 20.66 a barrel; heating oil was .18 cent to .31 cent lower with June at 49.46 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .45 cent to 1.39 cents higher with June at 72.61 cents a gallon. Cattle and hogs were up and pork bellies down on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in moderate trading. `` There's little I can tell you about the market,'' said <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Lind-Waldock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. `` It has given no clear direction.'' <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> said some traders are selling because they expect more cattle and hogs will be brought to market, while others are buying because they expect a decrease in deliveries. Live cattle settled .02 cent to .37 cent higher, with June at 71.45 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .22 cent lower to .10 cent higher with May at 76.30 cents a pound; hogs were .02 cent lower to .30 cent higher with June at 46.92 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .13 cent to 2 cents lower with May at 30.87 cents a pound. Gold and silver futures settled slightly higher on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as traders cashed in on what is thought to be an oversold market Despite the rise in prices, the market remains bearish because of the lowering of the inflation mentality, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Steel </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Without the threat of inflation there is little reason for investors to buy gold. Gold settled 20 cents to 80 cents higher with May at $ 378.20 a troy ounce; silver was 4.5 cents to 6 cents higher with May at $ 5.646 a troy ounce.

 Consumer confidence in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy remains strong despite growing indications of a slowdown caused by rising interest rates, the <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> group </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday. Its monthly Consumer Confidence Index, which tracks the spending plans and perceptions about the economy in 5,000 households nationwide, totaled 116.3 points in April, down only slightly from the 117.7 figure in March. The index is calculated on a 1985 base year of 100 points. An analysis of the latest index showed 28.8 percent of respondents believe current business conditions are good, unchanged from a month earlier, and 34.7 percent believe jobs are plentiful, slightly higher than the March percentage. Respondents were slightly less optimistic about the next six months, however. Only 16.5 percent anticipate an improvement in business conditions, vs. 18 percent who said so a month earlier. The index also showed only 3.1 percent of respondents plan to purchase a home, unchanged from March, reflecting continued concern with rising interest rates and the resulting higher cost of financing a mortgage. Nonetheless, the <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said in its analysis, the index showed consumer confidence remained resiliently high. `` The consumer's sustained sense of well-being is justified, at least for the moment, by the continuing vigor of the economy,'' said <PERSON> Fabian </PERSON> <PERSON> Linden </PERSON>, executive director of the group's consumer research center.

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings soared 73 percent in the first three months of 1989, and officials said Monday the results reflected favorably on the company's decision last year to get out of the risky oil business. The Houston-based company earned $ 109 million, or 82 cents per common share, in the 1989 first quarter on revenues of $ 3.3 billion. For the same period last year, <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 63 million, or 38 cents per share, on revenues of $ 3.2 billion. Those results included $ 53 million from discontinued operations. <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> sold its oil and gas operations last year to a number of firms for a total of $ 7.3 billion. During the first quarter this year, the company's natural gas pipelines posted earnings of $ 112 million, compared to $ 87 million in the same period last year. The increase resulted primarily from improved earnings in the non-federally regulated sectors of intrastate pipelines, methanol and natural gas liquids, and other non-jurisdicational marketing areas. <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION>'s shipbuilding division had a decline in earnings, going from $ 34 million in the 1988 first quarter to $ 30 million this quarter. The company said the decline was caused by lower margins on naval construction. <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> had an overall loss in its other divisions, which include farm and construction equipment, automotive parts, packaging and chemicals and minerals.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration on Monday delayed until Oct. 1 the effective date of a tough new tax provision aimed at ensuring that employers' health insurance plans do not discriminate in favor of higher-paid workers. `` The cost of compliance with Section 89 -LRB- of the Internal Revenue Code -RRB- as it presently stands is excessive,'' Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> meeting. `` The law needs to be changed and we stand ready to encourage, support and work with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to revise and improve it.'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s announcement of the three-month delay in the deadline for employers to comply with the law was greeted by loud applause from the business audience. Business has made repeal or modification of the Section 89 law as major goal this year. The law, proposed by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, was enacted as part of the 1986 tax overhaul. It requires employers to conduct a lengthy series of complex tests to demonstrate that their tax-deductible employee benefits, especially health insurance, are not weighted against workers making less than $ 50,000 a year. Paperwork required by the law is so voluminous that some employers are threatening to withdraw health insurance coverage for all employees. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s announcement came on the eve of a public hearing on the disputed section by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ill </LOCATION>, the committee chairman, and most members of the committee have signed a bill to significantly relax the testing requirements on employers. Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, also has called for overhaul of the provision. `` We have ... asked the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to work with the administration to find ways to revise Section 89 to make its requirements less burdensome on business,'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said. The regulations issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> `` impose unreasonable compliance burdens on business,'' he added. The Section 89 rules went into effect on Jan. 1 but the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> waived compliance requirements until July 1 and agreed that no employer would be penalized if a good-faith effort to follow the rules were made the remainder of 1989. Under <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>'s bill, employers that provide a health plan would have to offer coverage costing workers $ 10 a week or less -LRB- $ 25 or less for a family plan -RRB- to 90 percent of employees. Higher-paid workers would be taxed on the value of coverage that was better than provided other employees. Sen. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, D-Mich., said the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s decision was `` only a first step in cleaning up the administrative nightmare associated'' with the tax `` This should give employers the assurance that the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> wo n't rush into enforcing this flawed provision, and it should give the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> time to consider options ranging from substantial simplification to outright repeal,'' <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> said

<HEAD>30 Seconds of Radio Silence Set May 26</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Virtually all commercial radio stations in the country will go silent for 30 seconds on May 26, broadcasters said Monday, as part of a campaign to show the importance of radio in daily life. The 30 seconds of dead air time _ `` The day the radio stopped'' _ will mark the beginning of a $ 100 million campaign with the theme: `` Radio. What would life be without it.'' The booming voice of actor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> will tell listeners that `` for the next 30 seconds this station and others would like you to imagine your life without radio. Imagine if all your days sounded like this. ...'' Following the 30 seconds of silence, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> will say: `` Thirty seconds seems like a long time, does n't it? Now think how radio fills that silence for you.'' The radio campaign was announced at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION> convention. The <ORGANIZATION> NAB </ORGANIZATION> also inducted veteran sportscaster <PERSON> Red </PERSON> <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> and pioneer Spanish-language broadcaster <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Safir </PERSON> into the <ORGANIZATION> NAB </ORGANIZATION>'s Broadcasting Hall of Fame. The radio awareness campaign is a joint effort by <ORGANIZATION> NAB </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advertising </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. RAB President <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Potash </PERSON> said: `` The campaign is intended to increase awareness and appreciation for radio with advertisers and opinion makers and to remind us all that radio's influence is large and powerful.'' The bottom line, he added, `` is to increase radio's share of advertising dollars.'' The campaign also will include on-air commercials and newspaper and magazine ads. NAB President <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Fritts </PERSON> said `` this unprecedented collective action by commercial radio stations marks a new marketing era'' based on psychological research that shows `` radio is a vital part of people's daily lives that they take for granted.'' <PERSON> Fritts </PERSON> said 228 million Americans listen to radio an average of three hours and seven minutes a day. Follow-up surveys will determine if the campaign has increased awareness of radio. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyman </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ventures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> L.P. </ORGANIZATION>, said 10,000 stations are expected to go silent at 7:42 a.m. local time across the country. `` Not everyone has committed'' at this time, said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Berger </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Nationwide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Lyman </PERSON> said he had heard of only one station owner so far saying he would not participate. <PERSON> Lyman </PERSON> said broadcasters expect to hear a few complaints from listeners when their radios go silent. `` We want a reaction,'' <PERSON> Lyman </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> and <PERSON> Safir </PERSON> were honored for their contributions to radio over the years. <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> began announcing baseball on radio in 1934 with the <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reds </ORGANIZATION>. He later did play-by-play for the <ORGANIZATION> Brooklyn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dodgers </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION> and worked in 13 World Series broadcasts. <PERSON> Safir </PERSON> is vice president and general manager of <ORGANIZATION> KCOR </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. He began a two-hour Spanish-language program on <ORGANIZATION> KSTA </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> in 1940 and produced and announced Spanish-language programs for <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> during World War II.

 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Monday beat back several efforts to weaken measures demanded by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> Administration to make owners of savings and loan banks put more of their own money at risk in exchange for federal insurance of deposits. As <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> lobbied committee members to make S & amp; Ls devote more of their lending for low-income housing and inner-city redevelopment, the panel rejected attempts to continue past accounting techniques that had allowed many S & amp; Ls to operate with no real `` tangible'' capital. The key vote was on an amendment by Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridge </PERSON>, D-Pa., to give regulators authority to continue so-called `` good will'' exemptions from cash tangible capital requirements wanted by the administration and approved by the committee last week Ridge's amendment was defeated by a 28-23 vote after opponents said good will is `` fake capital'' and said it is worthless as a resource to make sure that S & amp; L owners have to pay before taxpayers do in any future bailouts. Also defeated on an voice vote was an amendment by Rep. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, that would have allowed the `` good will'' exemptions negotiated by <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L owners in pre-1985 mergers to account for one-fourth of an S & amp; L's tangible capital requirements unti 1993. Instead, the committee placed new restrictions on the industry's ability to rapidly increase their growth through so-called brokered deposits _ one factor blamed for the $ 100 billion magnitude of the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L crisis On a voice vote, it adopted an amendment by Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Neal </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.C. </LOCATION>, requiring both banks and S & amp; Ls with capital levels below federal standards to get prior approval before seeking brokered deposits in blocks of $ 100,000. `` In many instances, real high-flyer savings and loans attracted large deposits with high interest rates and used them to make risky loans,'' <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> said. When those loans went bad, many S & amp; Ls tried to `` grow their way out of trouble'' by seeking more brokered deposits at even higher interest rates for even riskier loans `` and we wound up with a much bigger tab because of it,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>. Assistant Treasury Secretary <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullins </PERSON> called the committee's actions Monday `` another good day'' for the administration's bailout plan He said the committee rejected `` resorting to acounting devices to water down'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposed capital standards. The effort, however, is likely to arise again when the bill reaches the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor. Rep. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., chairman of the powerful <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, expressed strong support for `` good will'' accounting in a letter last week `` We're trying to be tough and fair, and not just tough,'' said <PERSON> Ridge </PERSON>, who cited hundreds of <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> that lost much of their tangible capital in the early 1980s by taking over failed thrifts at the urging of the federal government. The committee chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION> _ who with a coalition of senior Repubicans and young Democrats on the committee has been leading the administration's fight for reforms against mostly young <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers who want to weaken them _ said good will is worthless as capital. `` It can not be converted to cash to offset losses,'' he said. `` When there is not capital or -LRB- only -RRB- fake capital, the losses fall to the insurance funds and the taxpayers.'' In exchange for taking over failed thrifts in the early 1980s and covering their losses, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> _ itself near insolvency _ granted healthy S & amp; Ls more than $ 20 billion in `` good will'' exemptions lasting up to 40 years from normal capital requirements. But the institutions that pitched in with that aid by using much of their own capital to effectively rescue the government's insurance fund then face possible extinction by the new standards wanted by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> and other reformers `` I understand that these institutions have a problem,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, who has been carrying much of the administration's case. `` But so do we. `` We're asking for $ 100 billion from taxpayers and flushing it down the drain,'' <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON> said. `` And if you do n't legislate against the 5 percent to 10 percent who would go back to the same practices that got us here, we'll be back where we are today.'' The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration originally proposed ending the exemptions gradually over 10 years in an effort to make S & amp; L owners put more of their own money at risk. The Senate two weeks ago extended the good-will phaseout to 25 years. But it said S & amp; Ls must show that by June 1991 they have $ 1.50 in tangible capital for every $ 100 of loans in their portfolios that could be seized before federal insurance funds are tapped to cover depositors' losses. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> voted to toughen that requirement last week, saying that <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls must have at least $ 3 of tangible capital for every $ 100 of loans by January 1995. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> spent more than two hours in offices off the committee's hearing room lobbying its members on behalf of amendments to raise corporate taxes to pay for the bailout and make <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls increase their lending to minorities and for inner city projects Specifically, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supports a proposed amendment by Reps. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., and <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>., that would finance the bailout by raising the alternative capital income tax from its present 20 percent to 25 percent and tax all capital gains above $ 175,000 a year at 33 The amendment has minuscule support and was not even introduced in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> as an alternative to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s elaborate financing plan to prevent the cost of the bailout from adding to the federal deficit and aggravating the need for higher taxes. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan would raise an immediate $ 50 billion for the bailout through the creation of an off-budget bond underwriter at an estimated cost to taxpayers of $ 200 billion to $ 250 billion over the next 30 years. `` This ` Read my lips' slogan that he's adhering to is the most costly slogan in history,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` The Reagan-Bush administration got us into trouble by disregarding their charge and mandate to regulate.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> proposed $ 1.15 million in fines for two contractors cited Monday for 115 safety violations in a methane gas explosion last year that killed three sewer tunnel workers. <ORGANIZATION> S.A. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Healy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <PERSON> McCook </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, was cited for 68 willful violations carrying fines of $ 680,000; <ORGANIZATION> CH2M </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Corvallis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, was cited for 47 willful violations carrying penalties of $ 470,000. <PERSON> Healy </PERSON>, the main contractor for the project, and CH2M, hired to supervise construction on the tunnel, have 15 days to appeal the citations and penalties to the <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Connors </PERSON>, regional administrator of <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> office <PERSON> Healy </PERSON> President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Malina </PERSON> said in a statement that his company had cooperated with <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>'s investigation and the citations were `` not a verdict but rather a starting point.'' `` We intend to vigorously defend against the <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> citations and look forward to presenting all the facts,'' he said. CH2M said in a statement the company was `` surprised and distressed'' by the citations and that all equipment listed in the 47 citations belonged to the contractor. `` The responsibilities of CH2M <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> as program manager do not include supervising or performing any of the construction'' on the project, the statement said. <PERSON> Connors </PERSON> said his agency's investigation found that electrical power had not been turned off after workers were evacuated from the tunnel Nov. 10 after dangerously high levels of methane were detected. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, 25, of <LOCATION> Sturgeon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohne </PERSON>, 49, of Big <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Sochacki </PERSON>, 34, of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>; were killed by a explosion after they re-entered the tunnel to check methane levels. Work has not resumed at the tunnel, but spokesmen for the project have said they hope work might resume later this month.

<TEXT>
 The Hotel Bel-Air, haunt of movie stars and the Hollywood elite, was sold Monday to a Japanese company for more than $ 100 million by its <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> owner. The price for the rambling, low-rise landmark works out to more than $ 1 million per room, a record for hotel sales that real estate experts say is unlikely to be surpassed any time soon. It demonstrates Japanese investors' continued appetite for such `` trophy'' real estate as prestigious big-city office buildings and resort property. <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> oil heiress <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, through her <ORGANIZATION> Rosewood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Property </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, announced that the <LOCATION> Bel-Air </LOCATION> had been sold to <PERSON> Sekitei </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaihatsu </PERSON>, a 95-year-old <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> company that operates hotels, resorts and restaurants in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rosewood </PERSON> said the landmark, which had been on the market for about two months, sold for more than $ 100 million, but did n't reveal the precise amount <PERSON> Rosewood </PERSON> will continue to operate the hotel, it said. The <LOCATION> Bel-Air </LOCATION>'s restaurant ranks with the nearby <LOCATION> Polo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lounge </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> among the city's chic dining spots. Recent diners have ranged from entertainers <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON> to <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> executive <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisner </PERSON>. One-time hotel resident <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> once called the hotel the best wife he'd ever had. The Hotel Bel-Air, which sits on <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>' tony west side not far from the <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> campus, has room rates ranging from $ 195 to $ 1,300 per night, with an average of $ 375 a night. Occupancy averages 90 percent, compared with a national average of 68 percent. Ms. <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>'s company bought the mission-style hotel and its 11-acre grounds in 1982 for $ 22.7 million and spent $ 20 million renovating it and adding 30 rooms, for a total of 92 rooms.

<HEAD>Labor Department Sues Shearson For Alleged Misuse Of Teamsters Funds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government on Monday sued a brokerage firm, an investment manager and several trustees of $ 561 million in Teamsters union benefit funds for allegedly abusing their positions for financial gain through stock deals and other transactions. Among the allegations in the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> suit is that the <LOCATION> Utica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, office of the brokerage firm <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> manipulated stock purchases for the funds to benefit other clients. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>, investment manager <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Farnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and several of their agents were charged with violating federal pension laws by causing the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> funds to engage in prohibited financial transactions. A copy of the complaint was released by <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> after normal business hours Monday and attempts to reach <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> officials were unsuccessful. A telephone call to <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Utica </LOCATION> office was not answered and a woman who answered the phone at <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said there was no one available to comment. Included in the alleged abuses were `` stock parking'' schemes in which <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>, acting through three of its employees, set up an account in its <LOCATION> Utica </LOCATION> office that it used to purchase stocks with the funds' assets. Instead of immediately transferring the stocks to the funds, the suit alleged that <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> `` parked'' them for a period of time to determine their short-term profitability and used accounting tricks to transfer securities that had increased in value to the accounts of friends, relatives and customers of two former <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> brokers who handled the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> account. One of the former brokers, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Inserra </PERSON>, allegedly used his knowledge of the funds' investment plans to benefit some of his individual clients by purchasing stock for them just before the funds made large purchases of the same stock. <PERSON> Inserra </PERSON> then allegedly sold the individual clients' stock at the higher prices caused by the bulk purchase. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> also allegedly benefited through fee arrangements with banks issuing certificates of deposits to the union funds. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> allegedly concealed indirect fees on assets invested in the certificates; <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> allegedly was paid to manage those investments but performed no services. The funds involved are the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pension </ORGANIZATION> and Retirement Fund, the <ORGANIZATION> Upstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retirement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> and Hospital Fund. Together they have about 65,000 participants and had $ 561,231,396 in cumulative assets as of the end of 1985, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. Eight current and former trustees of the funds were named as defendants for allegedly violating their fiduciary responsibily to the plans. The suit, filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, seeks a court order requiring the defendants to determine and restore with interest all losses incurred by the funds because of improper activities. It also seeks court-appointed monitors to review the practices of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> and an order prohibiting four current and former employees of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> from involvement in pension plans covered by the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act.

<TEXT>
 Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, suggested Monday that President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> safeguard national security by blocking the proposed acquisition of American mineral interests by a South African-linked company, but government lawyers said the president lacks the authority to intervene. `` By allowing this takeover we are undercutting the effectiveness of our country's anti-apartheid policy,'' <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> wrote in a letter requesting that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> act under a provision of the 1988 trade bill that the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> congressman co-authored with Sen. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Exon </PERSON>, D-Neb. <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> asked that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> investigate a $ 6 billion takeover offer made by <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION>, a Luxembourg-based holding company controlled by South African interests. <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> wants to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fields </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, a London-based mining company whose American holdings include <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minerals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Newmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> _ producers of gold, rutile, zircon, monazite, and other strategic minerals with military and nuclear applications. <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> said he's concerned the deal could increase <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s control over production of the minerals. `` I believe this takeover raises important security questions for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, which may not have been adequately considered previously, when this matter was under review by the inter-agency <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>, chairman of the subcommittee on commerce, consumer protection and competitiveness. However, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Canner </PERSON>, staff chairman of the inter-agency committee, said the panel had fully reviewed the merger and decided against proceeding with an investigation. `` If the committee decides not to go forward, that's it,'' he said. According to documents supplied by the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, government attorneys reviewed the deal's potential impact on strategic metals as well as anti-apartheid laws before concluding `` the transaction posed no threat to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> national security.'' Government attorneys said Monday that based on the legislative history that accompanied the trade bill and the executive order implementing the bill, once the 30-day review period ended without a decision to proceed to an investigation, action under Exon-Florio had concluded and the president had no authority to resurrect the issue. <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION>, which is 60 percent owned by <ORGANIZATION> Anglo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> De </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, is the largest producer of gold in the non-communist world. Gold Fields is the world's second-largest gold concern.

<HEAD>Eds: ADDS 5 grafs on BP raising its Alaskan crude price.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The energy futures market turned mixed in light trading Monday, with gasoline and crude oil rising in price and home heating oil continuing to decline. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the June contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline settled 1.39 cents higher at 72.61 cents a gallon. The May contract, which expired on Friday, had lost 3.91 cents. The June contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, rose 24 cents to $ 20.66 a 42-gallon barrel, after falling 50 cents on Friday. June heating oil, which gained 0.34 cent Friday, closed 0.31 cent lower at 49.46 cents a gallon. Heating oil has been on the decline in reaction to the warmer weather. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Lebow </PERSON>, an energy analyst at <ORGANIZATION> E.D. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Man </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, attributed the rise in gasoline to strong fundamentals, which, in turn, helped push up crude prices. `` We're motoring into the driving season and ... approaching the Memorial Day holiday,'' he said. Gasoline has been the market's star performer recently due to concerns of tight supplies for the summer driving season. Those concerns escalated following the Exxon oil spill off the Alaskan coast in March and a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> explosion recently. In a related move Monday, BP Exploration raised the price of North Slope Alaskan crude by more than $ 2 a barrel, pushing the it to its highest level in more than three years. The increase is partly attributable to the Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> oil spill and interruptions of production in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Lodgsdon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s chief petroleum economist. <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION> set its May contract price at $ 19.77 on the <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> and $ 19.33 on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. The difference reflects a variation in transportation costs. The prices represented a $ 2.25 a barrel increase on the <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> and $ 2.20 more on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. BP is the only North Slope producer that makes its prices public, but other North Slope producers usually follow <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION>'s lead.

<HEAD>Fed Official: Repeal of Interstate Banking Ban Would Even Competition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR H. ROTSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Repealing the barriers to interstate banking would remove handicaps on the industry in the national and international marketplace, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. A repeal of such barriers `` could do much to level the global playing field and to restore American banks to prominence around the world,'' <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Heller </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> at its annual conference. <PERSON> Heller </PERSON> also said repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act, which bars banks from engaging in securities activities, would benefit investors and borrowers and give customers better access to the securities markets. He said American banks are retrenching in the world market, while those in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> keep enlarging their share. American banks' international lending is down almost 15 percent, to about $ 100 billion, from its 1983 peak of $ 121 billion, while Japanese lending has gone from $ 28 billion to $ 129 billion, German and Swiss lending has more than doubled and British lending has expanded by nearly 50 percent, he said. In addition, <PERSON> Heller </PERSON> said, Japanese dominance has extended to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market, to no small extent `` because no bank is permitted to have a nationwide presence in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' He said it might be argued more accurately that <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> banks are competing against Japanese and German banks. `` At year-end 1987, 111 Japanese banks held over 40 percent of the deposits in the 500 largest banks in the world. Ninety <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks were in the top 500, but they accounted for only 11 percent of total deposits. `` No <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bank is among the largest 25 banks in the world, and Japanese banks occupy the top 10 positions,'' he said. <PERSON> Heller </PERSON> said removing the barriers to interstate banking also would `` result in more diversified and safer instutitions _ a highly desirable result in these difficult times.'' He said that while the presence of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> banks abroad has decreased, the reverse is true in this country, where 259 foreign banks operate through subsidiaries, branches and agencies, with combined assets of more than $ 600 billion, about 20 percent of total <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> banking assets. He said international banking has increased twice as fast as world trade over the past 25 years and four times as fast as world gross national product. He said a new agreement on risk-based capital signed by a dozen major industrial nations, known as the <LOCATION> Basle </LOCATION> Accord, should help redress inequities among banks incorporated in different nations by establishing uniform capital standards for banks that are internationally active. As for the banking and securities issue, <PERSON> Heller </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> will review the situation within a year `` with an eye toward allowing bank holding companies to engage in underwriting and trading equity securities.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> recently granted limited securities powers to bank holding companies. He said fulfillment of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s move toward a unified banking market and a uniform regulatory environment `` could mean the creation of the largest unified banking market in the world.'' However, a top <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> official told the group separately Monday they need not fear a `` fortress <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'' or reciprocity that would shut them out when the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>'s trade barriers fall in 1992 Sir <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Brittan </PERSON>, vice president of the commission, said the commission's objective is a liberalized, competitive market as open as possible to the world. As long as European Community institutions are not discriminated against and genuinely have access to American markets, bankers in this country have nothing to fear, he said. But a West German banking official said the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> should consider imposing reciprocity sanctions on <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to put pressure on that country to open its banking markets and to liberalize trade, much as <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> banks have done with some success. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohlhaussen </PERSON>, a director of <ORGANIZATION> Commerzbank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, said reciprocity is of `` absolutely no problem'' to American institutions in his country because of good banking relations. `` Our relations with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, however, have not always been of this character,'' he said. <PERSON> Kohlhaussen </PERSON> said <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has used the reciprocity argument against <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to press <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for access to its market. He said that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> often bring up the image of `` Fortress <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, probably to divert attention from ` Fortress <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.''' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> have been assuaged of their fears about a `` European fortress.'' But he added that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> represented `` a fortress where the doors were open, but when you came in, there were a whole lot of compartments, a whole lot of rooms that were locked up, one against the other.''

<HEAD>Board Of Trade Commissions Study Of Dual Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> on Monday said it has hired a university professor to study dual trading at the world's largest commodites futures exchange <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> will conduct the dual trading study in connection with the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>'s own review of trading practices. Dual trading, which refers to a trader buying or selling futures contracts for himself and for customers, has come under attack as a conflict of interest. The announcement comes three months after disclosures of a federal investigation into suspected fraud at the Board of Trade and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> has dedicated itself to evaluating all aspects of trading practices and market surveillance,'' said <PERSON> Karsten </PERSON> `` Cash'' <PERSON> Mahlmann </PERSON>, chairman of the exchange. `` Commissioning this study is another step in this process.'' One complaint is that dual trading creates a situation that allows a trader to first trade his own account in a way that would profit from price swings resulting from filing the customer's order That action would violate law. <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON>'s study of dual trading will be conducted in two parts, officials said, with the first _ explaining how the practice works _ completed by July. The second study, based on observing traders in the pits making dual trades, is due in 1990. <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON> was a contributor to a report on the 1987 stock market crash commissioned by the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mahlmann </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> `` has received many letters and other expressions of concern from commercial customers in our markets, requesting that we maintain the practice of dual trading. They understand the benefits it provides.'' The exchange, at the request of the <ORGANIZATION> Commodities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, had conducted its own study of dual trading. The study concluded the practice results in a better price for customer and adds to the liquidity of the market. The study also contended that customers can choose to trade with a broker who does not trade for himself. Brokers and traders at the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> have been under investigation for two years by federal agents who suspect customers may have been defrauded of millions of dollars. No charges have resulted from the investigation.
