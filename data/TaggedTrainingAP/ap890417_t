<HEAD>Barry Filed Federal Tax Returns Late</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 District of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> filed his federal income tax returns late in the early 1980s even though he had a refund coming each year, according to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. The newspaper quoted an unnamed source as saying that <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> waited until 1986 to file his 1982, 1983 and 1984 federal returns. Other sources told the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> filed several returns in 1986 but could not confirm the years. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> declined a request by the newspaper to be interviewed about his tax returns. His press secretary, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, released a statement that <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>'s returns are filed every year. `` First, my taxes are a personal matter between myself and the federal and district governments. Second, my taxes are filed every year by my accountant in the year in which they are due. Third, it is a violation of law for someone to give out my tax returns other than myself,'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said in a statement. The mayor, who has refused to publicly release copies of his tax returns since he was elected in 1978, filed late `` largely because of procrastination,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, in its Tuesday editions, quoted one of <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>'s associates as saying. Failure to file a federal income tax return is a misdemeanor and each count carries a possible one-year prison sentence. Although <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>'s federal returns for 1982, 1983 and 1984 were late, he apparently filed his <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> returns on time for those years, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> records show that <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> filed his 1982, 1983 and 1984 returns in the year in which each return was due, according a source familier with District tax records. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> received <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> refunds for each of the years except 1982.

 Her own screams wake <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Aniban </PERSON> from nightmares about military captors connecting wires to her thumbs, toes and breasts and sending jolts of electricity through her naked body. Miss Aniban, 26, a volunteer for the church-affiliated Task Force Detainees, said she and a male colleague were arrested in November and accused of being couriers for communist rebels. She denies it. She said she was interrogated at three military camps in the <LOCATION> Baguio </LOCATION> area, where they were arrested, and her captors tried to rape her three times. `` They tied my toes, thumbs and nipples with electric wires and then they plugged it into a socket,'' she said. `` They did it to me repeatedly and I fainted so many times. `` They took off my clothes and made me sit on a wet bed. I had my hands tied in the back and a pillow over my mouth. I screamed, and I felt like a chicken being butchered.'' After three days, Miss Aniban and her colleague were released. She said they had signed statements saying they were rebels and agreeing to serve as military informants. She said she did not file charges against her captors because whe felt it would be useless. Last year, she convinced her younger brother <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> to leave the rebels and he was shot to death five months later. As she cradled her dying brother in her arms, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Aniban </PERSON> said, he told her his assailants were pro-government militiamen. The family filed charges with the government <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> and a civil court, but no hearings have been held. Her experiences made her bitter. Although she works for a human rights group organized to monitor abuses under <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, the exiled former president, she now opposes <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, his successor. `` I expected my work to be risky, but I did not expect it could still happen under the new government,'' she said. `` Now, she is no longer my president.''

 <PERSON> Annette </PERSON> <PERSON> Funicello </PERSON> is gone, and so are <PERSON> Sherry </PERSON>, Cubby, <PERSON> Darlene </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> knocks'em dead with a calypso song-and-dance number. And <PERSON> Josh </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Tiffini </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lindsey </PERSON>, <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> and the gang get the studio jumping with a rap-and-disco blend of M-I-C-K-E-Y-M-O-U-S-E. The `` <ORGANIZATION> Mickey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>'' is back. And although its style has been updated, the people at <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> say it's just as good and relevant as the original television show was when it began 34 years ago. `` We had a lot of skepticism about doing the ` <ORGANIZATION> Mickey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>' in the 1990s,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Fields </PERSON>, senior vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Channel </ORGANIZATION>, which will carry the show `` But so many elements -LRB- of the old show -RRB- were terrific, and kids still relate to kids.'' Just like its predecessor, the new show is for and by kids from about ages 8 to 12 and features music, dancing, comedy skits, celebrity guests and the <ORGANIZATION> Mickey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> movie. The comedy skits are often geared to preteens' problems: dating, sibling rivalry, messy rooms, homework. `` It's trying to say: ` Hey, it's not easy being a kid. ... We're going to make you laugh and reduce some of the stress,''' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Clements </PERSON>, executive producer The show is designed to provide `` education through entertainment,'' but the accent is clearly on the latter, <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> says. `` It's all great fun. There are no messages that are knocked into people's heads, no public service announcements about drugs or anything like that,'' he said. `` This is my dream job,'' said head writer <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Silberberg </PERSON>, who has a master's degree in education from <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` We take entertainment and use it to educate about kids issues. ... The show gives them a sense that they're not alone out there.'' There's one big difference from the 1950s show _ cartoons have been replaced by music videos. One of the early episodes features a jazzy song-and-dance number on a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> street set. Another innovation is a segment in which club members from around the country are selected to spend a day with their special heros. Among the celebrities taped so far are <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dodgers </ORGANIZATION> pitcher <PERSON> Orel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hershiser </PERSON>, model <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>. In one segment, 13-year-old <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> goes to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Trump Plaza to talk with the developer about his business life and disciplinary problems that caused him to be sent to a military academy. Dressed in a suit and tie and calling himself a `` winner,'' the teen-ager asks for advice about investing $ 250 he has saved. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> tells him to put it in a bank until he is older. At the end, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> presents <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> with a pair of <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouse </PERSON> ears, which he adjusts over his carefully combed locks. The show is being taped before audiences at the new Disney-MGM Studios complex in central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and will be televised exclusively on the <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Channel </ORGANIZATION>, which has about 4 million subscribers. Fields said this will give <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> more control without having to worry about ratings. Talent scouts held auditions for about 5,000 kids around the country before selecting the lucky dozen featured on the show. The not-so-grown-up hosts are <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>, an actor, writer and comedian, and <PERSON> Mowava </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>, a former camp counselor with theater experience who has appeared in dozens of television commercials. The <ORGANIZATION> Mickey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> makes its debut April 24. The half-hour show will be shown weekday afternoons.

 A 3-year-old girl, the survivor of a rampage that claimed her mother, grandmother, two sisters, two aunts and an unrelated man, was showered with toys Sunday as she recovered from a slashed throat. Lawmen hunted her father, 28-year-old winery worker <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON>, from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. The object of compassion was 3-year-old <PERSON> Carmina </PERSON> <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON>, who was rescued bleeding and barely conscious Saturday from a wine country dump between <LOCATION> Petaluma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sonoma </LOCATION>, near the bodies of her two sisters, whose throats also were cut. <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON> has been hunted since Friday morning when officers discovered the bodies of his wife, <PERSON> Angela </PERSON>, 24, at their <LOCATION> Boyes </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hot </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> home; his mother-in-law and her two young daughters at their home in <LOCATION> Cotati </LOCATION>; and a co-worker at the Grand Cru Winery. Police have not yet pieced together the sequence of killings. `` We've got to find him, we've got to find him,'' <LOCATION> Sonoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Michaelsen </PERSON> mumbled at a news conference Saturday after the discovery of <PERSON> Carmina </PERSON> and her sisters. On Sunday, the owners of the Grand Cru Winery, where <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON> worked as a forklift operator, offered a $ 5,000 reward for information leading to his capture. `` These atrocities have caused fear and terror to invade an area known for its beauty and hospitality,'' <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bettina </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreyer </PERSON> said in a statement. The couple also established a trust fund for both <PERSON> Carmina </PERSON> <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON> and for the family of <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> <PERSON> Toovey </PERSON>, an assistant winemaker at <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cru </LOCATION>, who was shot to death in Friday's rampage. <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON> has been described by neighbors as a hostile gun-toter who drank a lot, a husband who harbored chronic, towering jealousy of his attractive wife _ to the point that he drove home from work several times a day to spy on her. Despite reports of <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON>'s having problems at work, however, <PERSON> Dreyer </PERSON> remembered his employee as a `` very competent'' worker who was `` quick to please.'' <PERSON> Carmina </PERSON>, her throat cut nearly from ear to ear, and her dead sisters, <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON>, 1, and <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION>, 4, were found near a landfill transfer station not far from where <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON> had fled with them Friday. <PERSON> Carmina </PERSON>, also suffering exposure and dehydration, was flown to <LOCATION> Petaluma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where she told deputies her father had slashed her sisters and herself. After two hours of surgery, <PERSON> Carmina </PERSON> was in stable condition. `` She's still in stable condition and doing well,'' nursing supervisor <PERSON> Stasia </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> said Sunday. `` Different people have sent stuffed animals. She has a teddy bears and a couple of bunnies.'' Doctors said she suffered some vocal cord damage but is expected to recover. A trust fund was being established for <PERSON> Carmina </PERSON> in a <LOCATION> Sonoma </LOCATION> bank. <PERSON> Michaelsen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON> is the only suspect in the killings. A ranch worker who was shot in a shoulder, apparently the first person attacked, had alerted authorities, sending them first to the winery where they found one man shot to death. At a news conference Friday, <PERSON> Michaelsen </PERSON> said a department psychologist had warned that the savagery of the slayings indicated <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON> `` no longer felt any affection or attachment to his own children.'' The three girls were spotted in a ravine near the dump by a man working on his truck. `` At first he thought they were dolls,'' the sheriff said. The man, unidentified, called to a worker from the dump and the two found `` yet another horrible scene,'' <PERSON> Michaelsen </PERSON> said. `` I tried to talk to the little girl who was still alive and I tried to comfort her,'' said the dump worker, <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. `` Her throat was nearly cut from ear to ear.'' Autopsies performed Saturday in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> revealed that Mrs. <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON> had been shot, and her mother had been shot and her throat was slashed, the sheriff's office reported. Mrs. <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON>'s two sisters, age 8 and 12, died of throat wounds apparently inflicted with a knife and had been raped and sodomized, <PERSON> Michaelsen </PERSON> said. A friend and a neighbor described <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON> as fiercely jealous of his wife. `` He's crazy. He was always going around with a gun,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, a next-door neighbor to the Salcidos. `` I could see it coming.'' `` One time he threatened to blow -LRB- his wife's -RRB- head off,'' he added. During the past week, <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON> was served with a <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> court order to pay $ 511 a month child support to his ex-wife in <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION> and nearly $ 6,000 for back support payments, according to court papers.

 Moviegoers remember its destruction by Martian invaders in `` War of the Worlds'' and TV viewers knew it as the Daily Planet in the `` Superman'' series. But for millions, the city's most recognizable landmark, the Byzantine-style City Hall tower, has been the center of government in the nation's second largest city. The 27-story building, the area's tallest structure through the 1950s but now dwarfed by skyscrapers twice its size, is about to get a facelift. Built in 1928 at $ 5 million, City Hall will soon undergo a $ 6 million makeover that includes illuminating the building at night. The renovation also includes a museum to display hundreds of gifts that the city has received, many from visiting dignitaries. Project Restore, a nonprofit organization of business and civic leaders, has raised about $ 1.5 million toward the project.

<TEXT>
 Once hailed as a rare success story in a continent plagued by coups, civil wars and corruption, this country enters its 10th year of independence Tuesday with little of the jubilation that marked its birth. When President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> led the white-ruled British colony of <LOCATION> Rhodesia </LOCATION> to independence as black-governed <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> on April 18, 1980, he inherited one of the healthiest agriculture-based economies in black <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. After having waged a bloody, seven-year guerrilla war for control of his homeland, he promised the 100,000 whites and 9 million blacks peace and prosperity. Many analysts believed <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> could serve as an example for the white rulers of neighboring <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, who maintain their black majority is not ready to run the country. Today, though still black <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s most prosperous nation, <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> is ailing. The economy is hemhorraging through shortages of foreign currency and a lack of foreign investment, both symptoms of bad policy making. Exporters who earn hard currency complain they get little encouragement from the government, and because there is no investment code the only significant foreign capital has been plowed into a baked beans cannery and a bubble-gum factory. The leadership of <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON>'s avowedly egalitarian and socialist state is crippled, thanks to a series of corruption scandals. Five Cabinet ministers, a provincial governor and a junior minister have resigned and several others face prosecution in the latest scandal, the black marketeering of cars and trucks. A war in neighboring <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> is bleeding this country's treasury to the tune of half a million dollars a day The 12,000 Zimbabwean troops there are guarding supply lines vital to landlocked <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>'s survival. At home, unprecedented popular discontent is growing over a host of ills ranging from official greed and economic mismanagement to record unemployment and galloping inflation. And homeless blacks often complain that land hunger, the main cause of the war for independence, remains nine years later. While 160,000 families were promised plots, only 40,000 have actually been resettled. On the credit side, <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON>, 65, a onetime cattle herder and school teacher, has fulfilled his promises of cheap education for all and free health care for the poor, who comprise most of the population. He also instilled national pride in the black majority that had been subjugated by colonizers for nine decades, crushed a rebellion by armed dissidents in the <LOCATION> Matabeleland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION> of western <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> and ended a feud with his old political foe, <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> <PERSON> Nkomo </PERSON>. The two signed an accord that will unite their parties in the next year as a prelude to establishing a one-party state in one of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s few Western-style democracies. But there has been mounting criticism that it could transform <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> into a leftist dictatorship, like <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, where the vote Zimbabweans fought for will be worthless. `` The leadership is rotten, and it will get more rotten in a one-party state,'' says <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Tekere </PERSON>, 52, a founder of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Zimbabwe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> and now its most vocal critic. <PERSON> Tekere </PERSON>, fired from the 15-member Politburo and the 90-strong <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in October after he denounced top-level corruption, represents <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON>'s only real political challenge. He has won widespread popular support for his stand. Public hostility toward elected leaders has grown in the last few years as politicians have vaunted their wealth, power, position and privileges. Cabinet ministers last year voted themselves earnings 20 times the statutory minimum wage of $ 50 monthly, which they also set. Most own several homes and farms, have interests in stores, hotels and other businesses, drive around in chauffeured limousines and frequently travel abroad to buy luxury items not available at home. `` In our pubs we do n't talk much about anything else but crooked politicians,'' said <PERSON> Oddwell </PERSON> <PERSON> Mlambo </PERSON>, 34, an unemployed laborer. `` No one attacks <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> himself, but if there were elections tomorrow, just about all his <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> would be thrown out.''

 This <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General-Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> poll is based on telephone interviews conducted March 6 through March 15 with 1,108 adults in the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Phone numbers were selected randomly and interviews were conducted with the adult who had the most recent birthday, a random phenomenon. The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the sample. The poll has a 3-point margin of error, meaning that if every adult American were asked the same questions, the results theoretically would be within 3 points of the poll's results, 19 times out of 20. The error margin is larger for subgroups. There are other sources of potential error in polls, including the wording and order of questions. These are the questions in this poll; because of rounding, sums may not total 100: 1. If a woman wants to have an abortion and her doctor agrees to it, should she be allowed to have an abortion, or not? Yes: 65 percent. No: 25 percent. Do n't know or no answer: 10 percent. 2.

Oppose: 50. Do n't know-No Answer: 5. 4. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled in 1973 that states can not prevent a woman from having an abortion if she wants one at any time during the first three months of pregnancy. Do you favor or oppose that ruling? Favor: 53. Oppose: 41. Do n't know-No Answer: 6. 5. If the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> reversed its 1973 ruling and let each state make its own abortion laws, abortion could become legal in some states and illegal in others. Would you want abortion to be legal or illegal in your state? Legal: 57. Illegal: 37. Do n't know-No Answer: 7 6. If abortion was illegal in your state, do you think that would stop most women there who want abortions from having them, or would most of them go to another state where it was legal? Stop: 7. Go: 87. Do n't know-No Answer: 6. 7. If abortion was illegal in every state, do you think that would stop most women who want abortions from having them, or would most of them have illegal abortions or go to another country for abortions? Stop: 20. Go: 73. Do n't know-No Answer: 7. 8. A group that opposes abortion has been holding demonstrations where its members block the entrances to abortion clinics until the police arrest them and carry them off.

 A series of bomb blasts in this city's crowded commercial center killed one person and injured 20 Sunday, the fifth day of a government-called cease-fire, authorities said No one took immediate responsibility for the bomb blasts. Both Tamil militants and majority Sinhalese extremists have carried out their own campaigns of terror. Police said all the victims were Tamil, and most of the injured were in critical condition. The blasts came in the wake of an offer for peace talks by Tamil rebels. A spokesman for President <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> called the rebel offer `` a major breakthrough'' shortly after it was made Saturday. <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> responded by asking the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION>, the largest and most powerful Tamil rebel group, to send their leaders to meet with him. Presidential press secretary <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooray </PERSON> said a message had been sent to <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Balasingham </PERSON>, political leader of the group, asking him to choose representatives for the talks. The Tamils made their offer hours after an ambush blamed on the rebels left 21 soldiers dead. The attack raied to 79 the number of people killed in three days of violence. Two of the bombs went off near a stand for buses bound for northern <LOCATION> Jaffna </LOCATION> town, a Tamil stronghold, police said. All the casualties occurred there. Another bomb, also placed in a bag and left on the sidewalk, exploded near a building where a former Tamil rebel group that has now joined the political mainstream kept its offices, police said. The building was damaged. Militant Tamils are waging a war against the government for an independent state. At least 10,000 people have been killed since the Tamil insurrection started in 1983. The Tamils claim they suffer discrimination at the hands of mostly Buddhist Sinhalese, who make up 75 percent of the population and control the government and military. Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, comprise 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people. <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> ordered a one-week cease-fire and offered amnesty to rebels willing to surrender arms in an effort to curb the ethnic violence that has plagued this <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> island.

 The government is banning racy television advertisements and commercials that show only non-Malaysian models, the information minister said in an interview published today. Beginning July 1, Caucasian and other non-Malaysian models can continue to appear in commercials only if the ads also include Malays, Chinese, Indians or other races that predominate in <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, said Information Minister <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahmat </PERSON>. `` We have told advertisers that if the cast is a mix of Caucasian, Pan-Asian and some of the multi-racial groups in <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, we will allow the commercials to appear,'' <PERSON> Rahmat </PERSON> said in an interview published in the New Straits Times daily. Commercials with women in swimsuits and scanty clothing will also be banned in this country Islam where is the official religion. Of the country's three TV channels, two are owned by the government and the other belongs to the ruling party. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Tang </PERSON>, Association of Accredited Advertising Agents of <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> President, said the ban was `` a little too harsh and debatable'' and called for the review of the ban. <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>'s 17 million population is 55 percent Malay and 37 percent Chinese, with the remainder mainly Indian.

<HEAD>IRS, Late Filers Both Putting in Overtime Today</HEAD>

 <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> employees put in overtime, post offices set up special mail drops and demonstrators made their cases as the nation prepared to end another federal tax return filing season at midnight tonight. <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> had no way of knowing how many taxpayers were waiting until the last minute to file. But the agency expects to receive 18 million returns this week, including those filed over the weekend, he said. The deadline is one day later in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and most of upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> because today is Patriot's Day, a legal holiday, in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, site of the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> center which processes returns from taxpayers in those states. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> expects to receive more than 109 million returns this year, many of which will come in well after the deadline. About 6 million couples and individuals are expected to get an extra four months to file _ but not to pay any taxes due _ by mailing Form 4868 before midnight. Many of the 650,000 Americans who live and work abroad are likely to take an automatic two-month extension. And, as usual, some taxpayers simply will miss the deadline and face a late-filing penalty. In many <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> offices, employees planned to continue offering advice tonight as long as taxpayers were asking for it. The Postal Service was doing its part by setting up booths at ballparks, selling stamps by the curb, and cooperating with radio stations and civic groups that were offering refreshments around post offices in an effort to make things a little easier for procrastinators. Around the nation, the Jobs for Peace Campaign sent demonstrators into the streets to protest military spending. They planned to pass out `` Build Homes _ Not Bombs'' stickers for taxpayers to attach to the envelopes containing their tax returns. The campaign is urging support for a bill to finance more housing by cutting military spending. The group calculates that 52 cents of every tax dollar goes for military spending, retirement and interest on money borrowed to finance weapons. By government figuring, the military will take 27 percent of next year's budget, not including interest or pensions. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, Sen. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON>, R-Ore., repeated a tax-day act he has performed for 10 years: introducing a bill that would allow conscientious objectors to pay their taxes into a fund that would be spent for non-military purposes `` We recognize conscientious objection in time of war,'' <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON> said in a statement. `` It is now time to recognize it in time of peace.'' The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, which represents most <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> employees, issued a statement accusing the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration of failing to budget enough money to finance the tax-collection agency. Employee travel and training have been cut and technicians have been pressed into clerical work because of the tight budget, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tobias </PERSON>, president of the union. By its actions, he said, the administration `` effectively declared April 17 a national holiday for tax cheaters.'' The Church of Scientology used the filing deadline as a way of reminding taxpayers of a new law designed to protect them when they have disputes with the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>. The church, which has had its share of scraps with the agency, announced it has published a free guidebook to the `` Taxpayer Bill of Rights.''

<HEAD>Nuke Plant Shut for Sleeping Operators Set to Reopen</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: meeting late afternoon EDT; top prospects uncertain</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The only nuclear plant ever shut down because control room operators slept on duty is ready to resume operations, amid signs that the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> will give its assent. An <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> order has kept the Peach Bottom plant in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> dormant for two years, but the commission planned a meeting for this afternoon along with a `` possible'' vote on reopening. Privately, commission officials said last week that all signs pointed to the plant gaining permission _ if not today, then shortly afterward _ to begin a slow ascension that would take it back to full power. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Murley </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>'s top reactor licensing official, declined to make a prediction Friday on the outcome of the meeting. But he said in an interview that the commission has seen significant progress in the management of the plant by <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` Clearly there have been big changes in the company, and it's a new company as far as <ORGANIZATION> Peach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bottom </ORGANIZATION> is concerned,'' <PERSON> Murley </PERSON> said. `` The operators have been retrained and there appears to be a new attitude.'' As the only plant ever shut down because of operator negligence, <ORGANIZATION> Peach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bottom </ORGANIZATION> is unique in the industry. Dealing with operators _ with people _ is vastly different than replacing equipment, and the shutdown has meant a review of the plant's entire management structure. The plant, located on the <LOCATION> Susquehanna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> near the <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> border, was ordered to stop producing power on March 31, 1987, by the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>, which said continued operation posed a public safety threat. A year later, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> stepped down as the utility's chairman and chief executive officer following criticism of the handling of Peach Bottom <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> has spent about $ 250 million in shutdown-related costs. The figure includes modifications to the plant, purchases of replacement power, and the company's share of a $ 1.25 million fine, the largest in <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> history. While the utility has shuffled its personnel, the changes at the plant have included more than just new faces. The company said management will play a broader role in day-to-day plant affairs than before. To end catnaps by operators, plant officials replaced comfortable, high-backed chairs in the control room with low-backed models. Operators' rotations have been changed so that workers do a week of days, followed by a week of an afternoon-evening shift, and then work the overnight. The rotation, which includes days off, used to go in the reverse order. The sleeping problems at Peach Bottom were not confined to a few workers. Last August, 33 present or former operators were fined $ 500 to $ 1,000 for `` sleeping and-or other acts of inattention to duty.'' `` We did n't set out to pick somebody and make an example of them,'' <PERSON> Murley </PERSON> said. `` It's just that the behavior we saw at Peach Bottom was so egregious that we felt we had no choice but to order them shut down. INPO -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- came to same conclusion and put more pressure on the top management.'' INPO, an Atlanta-based nuclear watchdog group, termed the plant `` an embarrassment to the industry and the nation'' in 1988. But this year, the group said <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>'s corrective actions at Peach Bottom have been `` responsive and effective.'' The utility said it would propose restarting one of its two working reactors, then seek permission to fire up the other one later this year. It would take a few months for either of the units to reach full power once approval is granted.

 Some small towns aspire to bigger things. But folks in this one hope to get even smaller _ about a thousand pounds smaller. In a modern day battle of the bulge, about 200 people in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> _ population 26,400 _ and surrounding <LOCATION> Bradley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> are competing with residents of <LOCATION> Sac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, to see who can shed the most. The competition is designed to promote the benefits of proper nutrition and exercise. `` The county that loses has to fly the flag of the other county for 30 days,'' says <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland-Bradley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which is sponsoring the effort. <LOCATION> Sac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, a farming region of about 14,000 people in northwest <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, organized a mass slim-down two years ago to bolster morale during the farm crisis, says <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Sac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tourism </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. Last year, nearly 800 participants walked or biked 286,686 miles and lost 6,438 pounds. That was enough to get national media attention. When <LOCATION> Bradley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> officials called for information, the Iowans issued their challenge and the meltdown was on. This year, more than 1,000 people from <LOCATION> Sac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> are involved, including 543 who are competing against 203 Tennesseans. The <LOCATION> Sac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> team weighed in at 78,851 pounds earlier this month; the <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> team tipped the scales at 36,926 pounds. Whichever teams loses the greatest percentage of weight by June 24 wins. Both counties feature competitions among individual teams with names like `` Bulge Busters.'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> says that's helped make things interesting. `` When you see 15 women get on a big scale and check in at over a ton, well, that's something,'' said <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 On the morning of June 5, 1876, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blaine </PERSON>, the speaker of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>, stood in the well of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and waved a packet of letters in the air. <PERSON> Blaine </PERSON>, one of the nation's foremost politicians, was in serious trouble. And he was about to confound his accusers. Nearly 113 years later another speaker of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> _ <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> _ faces accusations of unethical behavior in office. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> adamantly denies any wrongdoing. But he has been the subject of the most prolonged and intense of the several investigations conducted over the decades into the private and public affairs of a speaker of the House. Speaker <PERSON> Blaine </PERSON> rode out his scandal, but echoes of it were to follow him for the rest of his career. In the spring of 1876, <PERSON> Blaine </PERSON> was a frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination in the election that would replace President <PERSON> Ulysses </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>'s corruption-ridden administration. Three years earlier Reps. <PERSON> Oakes </PERSON> <PERSON> Ames </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Mass </LOCATION>., and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, D-Mass., had been censured by the House for involvement in the so-called Credit Mobilier scandal in which railroad construction stock had been given to selected members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, allegedly for favors Now <PERSON> Blaine </PERSON> became embroiled in the scandal, facing accusations that the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> had paid the speaker an inflated price for stock of a defunct and bankrupt rail line. An investigation was launched by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> but it was sputtering when new evidence emerged. It took the form of a set of letters between <PERSON> Blaine </PERSON> and a business partner which had come into the possession of a third man, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulligan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mulligan </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to testify before the committee, encountered an unexpected visitor at his hotel _ Speaker <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blaine </PERSON>. According to <PERSON> Mulligan </PERSON>, an emotional session followed in which <PERSON> Blaine </PERSON> fell to his hands and knees and begged for the letters, threatening suicide if he did not receive them. <PERSON> Mulligan </PERSON> claimed <PERSON> Blaine </PERSON> obtained the letters by a pretext and left the hotel. An uproar followed and <PERSON> Blaine </PERSON> came under intense pressure to make the <PERSON> Mulligan </PERSON> letters public. He refused, claiming they were private property. Instead, he obtained a statement from two lawyers who said they had examined the letters and found nothing relevant to the investigation. The uproar continued and <PERSON> Blaine </PERSON> set about to defuse it. On June 5 he appeared on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor and waved the packet exclaiming, `` There they are. ... There are the original letters.'' <PERSON> Blaine </PERSON> then read aloud what he said were the contents of each of the letters. He said he had handed over `` every solitary scrap and scrimption'' for inclusion in the Congressional Record. They had, he declared, `` no more to do with that investigation than the North Pole.'' But no one was ever shown the originals of the letters to verify <PERSON> Blaine </PERSON>'s reading of them. Events moved rapidly. <PERSON> Blaine </PERSON> collapsed outside his church suffering from a possible heat stroke. The investigation was postponed for two weeks to await his recovery. But before the committee could reconvene, the governor of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> appointed <PERSON> Blaine </PERSON> to fill a vacancy in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The investigation was postponed again, and eventually died. <PERSON> Blaine </PERSON>'s political backers proceeded, in classical <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> fashion, to make the best of a bad situation. In the 20th century it's called making lemonade out of a lemon. <PERSON> Blaine </PERSON>'s name was placed in nomination at the Republican National Convention by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingersoll </PERSON> on June 15, 1876, with words that gave <PERSON> Blaine </PERSON> an enduring nickname: `` The plumed knight from the state of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>.'' `` Like an armed warrior, like a plumed knight, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blaine </PERSON> marched down the halls of the American <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and threw his shining lance full and fair against the brazen forehead of every traitor to his country and every maligner of his fair reputation.'' <PERSON> Blaine </PERSON> never obtained the presidency. But he twice was appointed secretary of state. No House speaker has ever been ousted. But several have been singed during the 200-year history of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Clay </PERSON>, who was elected speaker six times, drew accusations of `` corrupt bargain'' when the close election of 1824 was thrown into the House of Representatives. The choice was between <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Quincy </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>. <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> and other members of the <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> delegation tipped the balance in favor of <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>. The accusations flew after the victorious <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> named <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> as his secretary of state. Speaker <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Randall </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Democrat, promptly called for his own investigation in 1879 after being accused of favoritism toward a company which provided the paper for the bonds and banknotes produced by the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engraving </ORGANIZATION>. He was quickly cleared. In 1910 Speaker <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON> faced a rebellion against his imperious and heavy handed rule of the House. Although not deposed, <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON> was stripped of much of his power. Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> `` Tip'' <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, D-Mass., was named in the so-called `` Koreagate'' influence peddling scandal in the 1970's but was

 Leave the kids at home, skip the <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> and take a `` scandal tour'' of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a raunchy romp through the ruins of political careers that takes ogling grownups from the Watergate to <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>'s old townhouse. With a <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> impersonator acting as host, the 75-minute bus tour leaving on weekends from the posh Ritz-Carlton Hotel is just the tonic for bored tourists willing to spend 20 bucks to indulge their taste for the trashy. Careening through city streets in a red, white and blue bus, a satirical comedy troupe called Gross National Product entertains customers with a bawdy commentary on passing landmarks where some of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s most prominent residents fell prey to sex, booze, greed or lust for power. Mostly sex. Outside the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, a <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> look-alike croons a song to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, the gentleman who supposedly preferred blondes. `` In my eight years in office, there will be no sex in the White House,'' vowed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, seizing the microphone. Past the Executive Office Building, where mock secretary <PERSON> Fawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> sobs her admiration for Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> _ `` the most patriotic man in the universe'' _ and recalls their Iran-Contra shredding parties. Passengers are given small plastic bags filled with shredded paper and signed `` Love, Fawn.'' On to the <LOCATION> Tidal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION>, where an inebriated <PERSON> Wilbur </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> saw both his congressional career and his companion, stripper <PERSON> Fanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Foxe </PERSON>, sink beneath the waves. Then to the Capitol, where <PERSON> John </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON> enjoyed a congress of a different sort and where a homosexual congressman `` let his fingers do the walking through the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> pages.'' The bus screeched to a halt behind the <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> townhouse where <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> was caught entertaining model <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, dooming his 1988 Democratic presidential hopes. It's still the highlight of the tour. `` Everybody out for some fresh air and fresh smut,'' shouted a female tour guide. `` You're going to get out of the bus, you're going to see it, you're going to touch it, you'll be there. The crowd clustered around the garage where `` <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> made her backdoor debut for the <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>,'' then strolled to the front of the house to pose for pictures. Back on the bus, the tourists sighed happily. `` What makes the best scandal?'' the guide asked. `` Sex,'' someone replied. `` Illicit sex,'' corrected a woman sitting in the rear. As the bus forged ahead, a black-robed comic posing as former <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON> offered to sell nickel bags of marijuana and `` crank up some <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlin </PERSON> tapes.'' A mimic of Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> promised to `` serve you like I served the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> _ on weekends.'' <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> London </PERSON>, the 34-year-old writer and producer who founded `` Scandal Tours'' last August, said he was inspired while escorting friends and relatives from his native <LOCATION> Hattiesburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, to the city's usual monuments and historical sites. `` I'd take them to the Capitol or the White House and you could see their eyes start to glaze over,'' he says. `` Sooner or later, they'd ask, ` Where's <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>'s townhouse?' and I'd take them. Then I thought, I ought to charge for this.'' The tours are especially popular with British tourists and Japanese businessmen, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> says. He's making plans to start `` scandal tours'' in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, where `` the Brits take the prize,'' and possibly <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, who plays <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on the tour, says <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> provides a constant source of comedy material because of its explosive mixture of power, money and sex. The result, he says, is `` bad things happening to people it is hard to feel sorry for.'' <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> says the tour focuses on sex scandals because they're `` easier for people to understand'' than complicated affairs involving financial wrongdoing He says he's found that Republicans account for 90 percent of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s money scandals, while Democrats are usually the culprits in sex scandals. `` That means that Republicans are spending a lot of time making money,'' he said, `` and you can guess the rest.''

 Director <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pakula </PERSON>'s latest film is about the difficulties of a couple in their courtship leading to a second marriage _ a subject he knows from personal experience. It is no accident that `` See You in the Morning'' is the first film <PERSON> Pakula </PERSON> has written, directed and produced because the question of personal control and vulnerability is key to the project. <PERSON> Pakula </PERSON>, director of such films as `` Klute,'' `` All the President's Men,'' and `` <PERSON> Sophie </PERSON>'s Choice,'' slipped into the second person tellingly while discussing the film with The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. `` Coming out of a bad experience, a relationship that failed, there's a part of you that matures underneath that,'' <PERSON> Pakula </PERSON> said in the interview published Sunday. `` But there's a part of you that goes back to younger kinds of insecurities and vulnerabilities. Rejection can do that to you.''

So <PERSON> Monaghan </PERSON>, owner of <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbor-based </PERSON> <PERSON> Domino </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Pizza </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, joined with a retired <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> agriculture professor in a project they hope will prove there's still money in small farms. <PERSON> Monaghan </PERSON> is financing the 25-acre spread three miles outside of <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbor </PERSON>. The soggy fields began their transformation last fall under the supervision of <PERSON> Booker </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whatley </PERSON>, author of the book `` How to Make $ 100,000 Farming 25 Acres,'' The Grand Rapids Press reported Sunday. The goal is to show that farms of 10 to 200 acres can succeed as well as family-run operations of 200 to 1,000 acres and agribusiness concerns of 1,000 acres or more. `` This country can and should support all three categories,'' said <PERSON> Whatley </PERSON>, 73, formerly of the faculty of <ORGANIZATION> Tuskegee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> and publisher of the Small Farm Technical Newsletter. <PERSON> Monaghan </PERSON> read about <PERSON> Whatley </PERSON> in The Wall Street Journal. Seeing a chance to fulfill his own dream, he introduced himself at a speaking engagement by the agricultural theorist in <LOCATION> Lansing </LOCATION>. Since fall, workers have dug a trout pond, established a fallow deer herd and begun building a 1-acre sinking garden for vegetable production, farm manager <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Trout </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Whatley </PERSON>'s book argues that small farms can succeed if they provide a year-round daily cash flow, produce at least 10 different products with no one product making up more than 10 percent of the gross, and produce goods that have definite markets. <PERSON> Monaghan </PERSON> said he will give his Domino's headquarters employees the option of spending occasional days at the farm instead of working their desk jobs.

 Uruguayans on Sunday voted not to end an amnesty for soldiers and police accused of human rights abuses during the 1973-85 military dictatorship. With 6,360 of 7,072 districts reporting in the referendum on the 1986 amnesty, supporters tallied 922,185 votes, or 53.32 percent, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, and while opponents numbered 678,087, or 39.21 percent. About 128,969 votes, or 7.47 percent, were blank, annulled or ruled questionable for technical reasons. Early today, a co-president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> for a Referendum conceded defeat. `` The law has been confirmed,'' <PERSON> Matilde </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Larreta </PERSON> told reporters. `` Without doubt, the pronouncement of the popular will should be adhered to.'' However, she called for a `` national compromise'' on the issue, and said, `` about 40 percent voted to annul the law. ... The country and all its institutions can not be insensitive to the circumstances that nearly one-half of the population disagrees radically'' with the amnesty. Unofficial tallies indicated that voters in the capital narrowly rejected the amnesty while voters in the countryside heavily favored it. Shortly after polls closed at 7:30 p.m -LRB- 6:30 p.m. EDT -RRB- and before any results were known, President <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanguinetti </PERSON> called for national unity in an address carried on national radio and television. `` Until a short while ago, some of us were ` yellows,' others ` greens,''' he said. `` That has just ended. ... We are all Uruguayan citizens and now we have to listen to the voice of the people.'' Supporters of the amnesty cast yellow ballots; opponents cast green ones. The government, including <PERSON> Sanguinetti </PERSON>, supported the 1986 law giving amnesty to scores of police and soldiers accused of human rights abuses in a campaign against leftist guerrillas during 12 years of military rule. Leftist political parties and human rights groups, which mounted a huge petition drive to put the issue to a vote, say trials of those accused of human rights abuses are necessary before democracy can be considered fully restored. After campaigning ended on Thursday, both sides pledged to respect the outcome. By late Sunday night, neither side had claimed victory or conceded defeat. `` We're still gathering information and making our own computations,'' said <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> for a Referendum. The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> estimated that about 65 percent of the 2.3 million Uruguayans eligible to vote had cast ballots. Voting is mandatory in <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> and turnout usually tops 80 percent. Turnout apparently was lower than usual Sunday because of gray skies and rain. But lines were long from the moment schools, cultural centers, movie theaters and other places used as polling stations opened. Many voters waited for an hour or longer huddled under umbrellas or building overhangs. `` A country that forgets its past has no future,'' said a well-dressed woman standing in line to vote in a neighborhood along the estuary of the River Plate. `` A future of peace and justice depend on overturning'' the amnesty, said the woman, who refused to give her name. If voters rejected the amnesty, trials would not start immediately. Vice President <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarigo </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> then would have to decide whether the amnesty would be annulled _ meaning a ruling that it never legally existed _ or merely overturned. If the law were just overturned, the change could not be applied retroactively. The amnesty freed security forces from the possibility of prosecution in connection with a 1970s crackdown on leftist subversion. About 150 Uruguayans were killed and 200 were arrested and never seen again. Thousands suffered physical and psychological torture under detention. The military maintains it was fighting a war against urban guerrillas, particularly the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Tupamaros </ORGANIZATION>, whose bombings, kidnappings and assassinations had convulsed the country for years. The military took control in February 1973 by setting up a security council with the authority to veto government decisions. Four months later, it forced President <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bordaberry </PERSON> to dissolve congress. The Tupamaro urban guerrillas by that time had been quelled as a military threat, and the armed forces began to crack down on leftist subversion in general. <PERSON> Sanguinetti </PERSON> was elected in November 1984 after democracy was restored. By 1986, about 50 cases had been filed accusing about 180 soldiers and police of kidnapping, murder and torture. The military high command said it would not require soldiers to answer charges in civilian courts. <PERSON> Sanguinetti </PERSON> broke the impasse by pressing for an amnesty, which <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed on Dec. 22, 1986. Human rights and leftist political groups vowed to challenge the amnesty in a vote. The <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last year affirmed that the required 555,701 voters, or 25 percent of the electorate, had signed petitions for a referendum.

 Most of the 1 million elderly poor people who do not get the government benefits to which they are entitled either do not know they are eligible or are incapable of filling out the necessary forms, a private foundation said today. The study by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Villers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> was aimed at answering the perplexing question of why only about half of those eligible take advantage of the Supplemental Security Income program established by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1972. The program is intended to provide a minimal income floor for the nation's aged, disabled and blind. `` Some people say that the poor do n't apply for SSI because they are embarrassed. We found that's not the heart of the problem,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON>, executive director of the non-profit foundation that concentrates on issues affecting the elderly poor. `` The main reasons they do n't apply are that they do n't know they can or they do n't have the help they need to fill out the application form. `` A safety net does n't do any good hidden in a bureaucrat's desk,'' added <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> `` You've got to get it out there, under the people whose lives are falling.'' The foundation based its conclusions on interviews with 6,214 elderly people at community meal sites in 15 states and on interviews with staffers at 31 district Social Security offices and 358 community organizations serving the elderly. It was not designed as an academic study and did not seek to ensure that the 6,214 elderly people questioned were a scientifically drawn survey of elderly people eligible for the program. Given those parameters, the survey found that: _ Only 33 percent knew <ORGANIZATION> SSI </ORGANIZATION> could increase an eligible person's _ More than 90 percent assumed, incorrectly, that having a low paying job would automatically prevent an individual from receiving SSI _ Half thought, incorrectly, that owning a house or car would automatically bar an applicant from eligibility _ More than a third thought, incorrectly, that anyone receiving regular Social Security benefits would be barred from also collecting SSI A third of the Social Security district office managers had no staff to assign to outreach activities and 40 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> SSI </ORGANIZATION> client contacts with the 358 community organizations were for help filling out the 12-page application that asks 45 multiple-part questions. Applicants, some of them frail and functionally illiterate, are required to supply documentation of age, rent or mortgage payments, employment status, living arrangements, assets, Social Security and pension benefits, insurance and property ownership.

<HEAD>Carriage Breaks Down As Re-enactment Journey Begins</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOUNT VERNON, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The start of the bicentennial celebration of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>'s presidential inauguration went off without a hitch. But not without a problem. A sparkling antique carriage carrying an actor portraying <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was less than 100 feet into the 250-mile trek from <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vernon </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> when it broke down Sunday. One of the wheels hit a fence post and broke the main shaft connecting the harnesses and the carriage. The shaky departure was the only problem during opening festivities celebrating the bicentennial of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s inauguration on April 30, 1789 The eight-day trip will take the entourage to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on April 23. The first inauguration will be recreated in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s Federal Hall on the anniversary date `` It is far more, far more indeed, than a re-enactment and a celebration of a 7 -LCB- - day trip,'' former <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Chief Justice <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burger </PERSON> told the crowd of about 3,000 `` This is a trip, a journey that has lasted 200 years, and God willing, will last for many hundreds of years in the future.'' <PERSON> Burger </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Bicentennial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, opened the ceremony with the dedication of a 25-cent stamp bearing the likeness of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in honor of the bicentennial of the executive branch of the government. One spectator in particular was moved by the performance. `` This is something very special for me,'' said <PERSON> Josephine </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, 67, of <LOCATION> Gulfstream </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, who said she is a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> descendent. `` This is one of the foremost families in the history of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. To think that any of those genes are in my body gives me something to look up to and to strive to emulate.'' About half the journey is to be made by carriage. The trip will take the entourage through the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. In his role as <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, actor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sommerfield </PERSON> began the journey by greeting an actor playing the role of Secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON> arrived at <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vernon </ORGANIZATION> on April 16, 1789, with the news of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s election. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> immediately left for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> _ but not without apprehensions. `` No one has filled this great office before,'' he said. `` Each thing I do will be a precedent.'' Just as <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> before him, <PERSON> Sommerfield </PERSON> left by carriage, but after it the post the actor jumped into a van. `` Strange vehicle, strange vehicle,'' said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> of his first automobile ride. `` In the war, the unexpected was the expected.''

<TEXT>
 Authorities discovered two more bodies Sunday buried on a collective farm two miles south of a ranch where 13 victims of a cult of human sacrifice were found last week. Investigators said they have evidence the male victims were killed by the same drug smuggling cult suspected of performing human sacrifices on the 13 males discovered Tuesday at <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elena </LOCATION>, about 20 miles west of <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Cameron </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said the victims found Sunday were connected to the drug smuggling operations of the cult, but were not victims of the cult's rites as were the other 13. Unlike the bodies uncovered at <ORGANIZATION> Rancho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elena </ORGANIZATION>, the bodies found on the farm were not mutilated, said Mexican federal police group chief <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON>. Acting on a tip from some children, a 72-year-old man led police Sunday to the common grave in a clearing in an orchard on the farm, <LOCATION> Ejido </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Librada </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON> told reporters. The dead were identified as <PERSON> Moises </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON>, the son of the man who led police to the site, and <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuente </PERSON>, also known as `` El Guero'', or `` The Blond.'' Both were killed by machete chops to the back of the head, said <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Degadillo </PERSON>, an employee at <LOCATION> Funerales </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rosario </LOCATION>. Some of the victims found on the ranch last week also were killed by machete chops. `` It was a revenge type killing. It was a drug deal gone sour,'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said. The sheriff said the men apparently died in May. He said he knew about the men because of an ongoing investigation into the drug smuggling ring. However, a spokeswoman for the federal judicial police in <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION> said the two men were farmhands who had been missing since last May. The children told the 72-year-old man, <PERSON> Hidalgo </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON>, that they had seen some people burying a body in an orchard last October, <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Moises </PERSON>, 52, disappeared last May. <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON> said <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> had discounted the children's tale until the 13 bodies were dug up. The two bodies were stacked and appeared to be those of adults, investigators said. Neither had been positively identified as of Sunday night. Officials disinterred the second body just before sunset Sunday. <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON> searched through the pockets of a pair of black pants found on the second body and discovered 3,000 Mexican pesos and a $ 5 bill. Four suspects arrested in the slayings of the 13 discovered on <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elena </LOCATION> have told police they killed 13 or 14 people in bizarre rites intended to protect a marijuana smuggling ring. Among the victims were a 16-year-old boy and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON>, missing since March when he came here during spring break from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION>. Police said the suspects have been cooperative in pointing out the bodies and had not mentioned burying anybody on Ejido <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Librada </LOCATION>. Ejido means collective farm in Spanish. Officials said the group trafficked in drugs and believed the human sacrifice would protect them from police. In <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>, authorities found altars covered with black chicken feathers, burned turtles, cigars and other occult offerings. The bodies had been mutilated, some with their hearts or brains ripped out. Police in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are seeking alleged ringleader <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON> and three others, including <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON>, a college student identified as the `` godmother'' of the cult. In a related development, <ORGANIZATION> Notimex </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> government news agency, reported Saturday that a woman identifying herself as <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON> <PERSON> Villareal </PERSON> called a local radio station threatening to kidnap children as hostages and burn them if the four prisoners were not released. The news agency said local police in <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION> dismissed the report as a hoax.

 Federal and local police say they capped a two-year investigation by breaking up a drug cartel that brought as much as 440 pounds of cocaine into the violence-torn <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> area.

 Millions of dollars intended for AIDS research is instead being used to the drug AZT for needy AIDS patients because <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> reauthorized the free drug program without providing money for it. The program was to expire last September, but was extended without an appropriation. Congressional leaders subsequently made clear they expected <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> officials to tap other AIDS accounts for the money. Although the program is authorized at $ 15 million for the current fiscal year, the company that makes the drug _ <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION> _ is picking up $ 5 million of the cost by making that much of the drug available free.

<HEAD>Biography: JFK Left Behind Nuclear Codes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> once sneaked away for a sexual liaison without telling the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and without taking the list of codes he needed in the event of a nuclear attack, a new book says. The book also says that <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON>, in a telephone conversation with <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>, offered to divorce the president if the actress would agree to marry him and move into the White House. The biography by <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Heymann </PERSON>, `` A Woman Named <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON>,'' was to be serialized beginning today in the weekly Star, a supermarket tabloid. The Star reports in its April 18 edition that later excerpts will include disclosures about amphetamine use by the <PERSON> Kennedys </PERSON> in the White House. <PERSON> Heymann </PERSON>, also author of `` Poor Little Rich Girl: The Life and Legend of <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON>,'' said that he obtained <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> files through the Freedom of Information Act and that he and his researchers conducted 825 interviews. He also had access to the former first lady's <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> social files. Mrs. <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON>' spokeswoman, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuckerman </PERSON>, said Friday that Mrs. <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> had no comment. The charges about <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> sneaking away from the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> were made by <PERSON> Langdon </PERSON> <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a former defense consultant to <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. The book said <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> sneaked out of the Hotel Carlyle in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to attend a party at a townhouse across the street. `` Within minutes, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> had made his choice of partner and gone off with her to her apartment. Moments later, the Secret Service arrived. Where was the president? Nobody knew. The agent paled. `` On the street in front of the townhouse stood an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant with an attache case handcuffed to his wrist. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> was off making love, and the bagman with the black satchel had been left behind. `` The Russians could have bombed us to hell and back, and there would have been nothing we could have done about it,'' <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> was quoted as saying. The date of the alleged incident was not given. <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> died in 1987, according to <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Bodner </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the publisher, <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON>. `` We are not aware of any material that would support that allegation,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Rigg </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> also had illicit sexual liaisons on the night of his inauguration and before the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> debates, the book said. Miss <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>, who has been romantically linked with the president, told <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s brother-in-law <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawford </PERSON> that she had called Mrs. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, according to the first part of the series. `` According to <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> was n't shaken by the call. Not outwardly. She agreed to step aside. She would divorce <PERSON> Jack </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> could marry him, but she would have to move into the White House. If <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> was n't prepared to live openly in the <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION>, she might as well forget about it,'' <PERSON> Lawford </PERSON> was quoted as saying. `` Actually, <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> was infuriated by the call, and for some reason blamed <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> for it. She could n't easily blame me because I was family, so she took it out on him. <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> was no longer welcome at the White House, or in any of the other <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> bastions,'' said <PERSON> Lawford </PERSON>, who since has died.

<TEXT>
 A soccer-mad city poured out its grief for 94 dead at two of its prominent shrines _ the modern Roman Catholic cathedral and the home field of <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> football club. In the early hours today, people were still coming to the main gate of <LOCATION> Anfield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION> stadium, converging on a 100-foot expanse of steel fence and gate covered with clusters of flowers, club banners, scarves and hats. `` They only wanted to see their heroes ... `` began one long epitaph taped to the fence honoring <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> fans who died in a human crush Saturday at <LOCATION> Hillsborough </LOCATION> stadium 65 miles away in <LOCATION> Sheffield </LOCATION>. At the gate, a memorial to legendary manager <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Shankly </PERSON> adorned with the motto `` You Will Never Walk Alone,'' a man and woman stood locked together in love and grief, barely moving for more than half an hour while the woman's sobbing never ceased. Many others could be heard crying but few spoke. `` We're all so close. Everyone knows someone who died,'' said <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Travers </PERSON>, 20, who had come to put up a card for a 16-year-old friend who died in <LOCATION> Sheffield </LOCATION>. `` So sad, so sad,'' a strapping young man said brokenly as he walked along the barrier. Another clenched a fist and cried out `` Why?'' With the adjoining street closed to traffic, sometimes the only sound was people crying or the footfalls of people coming and going. At the Metropolitan Cathedral, which was filled to overflowing for an ecumenical requiem Mass, the red banner of <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Football </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> stood near the altar. At the Anglican Cathedral, the <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> tolled 94 times. Customarily rung for the death of a monarch, the bell's deep tone had last been heard on May 29, 1985, ringing for the 39 mostly Italian fans killed in a riot involving <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> fans at a Belgian stadium. <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION>'s match on Wednesday against <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> has been canceled. `` It is our view that all football matches involving our club should be suspended for the time being,'' club chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said Sunday. But the <LOCATION> Anfield </LOCATION> stadium was open during the day and fans came to place flowers on the `` Kop,'' the terrace behind one of the goals where thousands of fiercely loyal fans congregate. It was on a similar but smaller terrace at <LOCATION> Sheffield </LOCATION> that the 94 fans died. `` You Will Never Walk Alone,'' a song known to every fan on the Kop, was repeated on many of the messages left at the gate. Among the messages was one from a survivor, `` To those who carried me from the goalmouth yesterday, you never knew me but I'll never forget you. Other expressions of sympathy were left by fans of <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION>'s other big-league football club, <LOCATION> Everton </LOCATION> In many families, children grow up with split loyalties to the red and white of <LOCATION> Liverpool </LOCATION> and the blue and white of <LOCATION> Everton </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> is by far the more successful club _ four times European champion and a record 17 times English League winner _ but the rivalry with <ORGANIZATION> Everton </ORGANIZATION> is respectful and friendly. <ORGANIZATION> Everton </ORGANIZATION> qualified Saturday for the final of the premier English F.A. -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Football </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- Cup, its third final in six years. Soccer authorities will decide this week if and when to replay <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION>'s semifinal game.

<HEAD>More States Debate Ways to Insure the Working Poor</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 At least a dozen states are considering laws that would force companies to insure their employees as a way to stem billions of dollars in hospital losses and protect some of the 37 million Americans without health insurance. <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> in 1974 became the first state in the nation to adopt a mandatory insurance law, and it was followed last year by <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. This year, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and other states are debating bills that would order companies to cover workers, impose tax penalties on those that do n't and provide incentives for those that do. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and a few other states have adopted pilot projects to provide health care to the working poor. And last week in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., and Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., introduced federal legislation that would require employers to buy health insurance for all full-time Similar legislation failed last year. `` It is time to make health care a basic right for all, not just an expensive privilege for the few,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. More than 37 million Americans lack health insurance; about two-thirds _ 24 million _ are workers or their families. Their numbers have grown about 1 million a year since 1980, their ranks swelled by workers who once held well-paying factory jobs and now work in the service industry. Hospitals have been prime supporters of the effort on the state and federal levels to insure the poor. Small businesses oppose mandatory insurance, saying they can not afford to provide health care benefits. In 1980, hospitals lost $ 2.8 billion in health care costs for which they received no reimbursement, or about 3.6 percent of their total costs, said <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON>, a health project manager with the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Seven years later, losses for treating the poor rose to $ 7.2 billion, or 4.7 percent of total hospital costs, she said. Many workers are unable to pay their bills because their employers provide no insurance and they earn just enough to be ineligible for assistance through Medicaid, which has wage ceilings that vary from state to state. According to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a family of three in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> could earn only $ 1,416 per year to be eligible for Medicaid, while the same family in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> could earn $ 8,316. Fifteen years after <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> passed its mandatory insurance law, opinions differ on the program's success, and its applicability to mainland states. `` I would say to anyone looking, do n't use <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> as an example because it's a poor example,'' said <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Slom </PERSON>, president of Small Business <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. `` Neither employees or employers are satisfied.'' Employees are offered health insurance if they work at least 20 hours a week for four consecutive weeks. The law excludes government employees, family businesses and people who work on commission, such as real estate agents. Employees pay 1.5 percent of their monthly wage, or one-half the cost of the insurance premium, whichever is less, and the employer pays the balance. `` We think it's working well. The employers are attuned to the law and comply,'' said <PERSON> Tomio </PERSON> <PERSON> Anzai </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Prepaid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Branch </ORGANIZATION> of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> and Industrial Relations. <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>'s law would n't work elsewhere, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Weidman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, manager of state media relations for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Businesses </ORGANIZATION>. `` I would hasten to point out that <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> is neither a mainland nor a mainstream state,'' he said. `` It's more like <ORGANIZATION> Disneyland </ORGANIZATION>. It's easier to gouge tourists who will have to pay more for everything from macadamia nuts to shoeshines.'' <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Lipson </PERSON>, senior research associate at <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> InterGovernmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION>, agreed that <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> is a special case. `` You've got a unique situation in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>,'' she said. `` If -LRB- small companies -RRB- decide the cost of doing business is too high, they ca n't just jump over to the next state.'' Last year, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> went a step further with a law providing health security both to workers and the unemployed. The program, aimed at the one in 10 people in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> who have no insurance, is being installed in phases and will take full effect in 1992. The program could cost up to $ 1 billion over four years. <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> lawmakers are considering a measure that would provide basic health coverage to the poor, with its $ 150 million cost paid by a payroll tax on employees and employers. Companies providing insurance could get tax breaks.

<HEAD>Magazine Gives Details of Soviets Worst Space Disaster</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A magazine has published details of the worst disaster in the Soviets' space program, indirectly blaming the deadly launchpad explosion of an unmanned missile in 1960 on haste to catch up with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The weekly <PERSON> Ogonyok </PERSON> said in an article Sunday that workers ignored safety rules in the rush to launch the first Soviet intercontinental ballistic missile in the race with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to develop ICBMs. It said `` a significant number'' of people perished in the explosion and fireball of the R-16 missile at a launching pad at <LOCATION> Tura-Tam </LOCATION> near the <LOCATION> Aral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. The only victim identified by <PERSON> Ogonyok </PERSON> was Chief Artillery Marshal <PERSON> Mitrofan </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nedelin </PERSON>, serving as the first commander of the newly created Soviet rocket forces. It said he was about 60 feet from the missile when it exploded. The late <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>, who was premier at the time of the accident, said in memoirs published in the West that dozens of soldiers and workers were killed. Accounts of the disaster on Oct. 24, 1960, have circulated abroad but <PERSON> Ogonyok </PERSON>'s report was the first in the official Soviet media. It said: Launch of the R-16, which was to be the maiden flight of the Soviets' first ICBM, had been scheduled for Oct. 23 but was postponed because of an electrical defect in the engine that caused a fuel leak. In one of the `` gravest violations of safety precautions'' the hatches were removed and welding work undertaken on the fully fueled rocket. Late the next day the launch was scheduled in 30 minutes but workers were still installing an electrical distributor that somehow gave a command to ignite the rocket's second stage. Flames from the ignition burned through the fuel tanks of the first stage, touching off the fire and explosion. <PERSON> Ogonyok </PERSON> quoted a worker as saying, `` A stream of fire burst out of the rocket, inundating everything around it. People tried to escape by running to the covered area where cars and other equipment were, but the road literally melted in front of them, blocking the escape route.'' The magazine said the heat was so intense `` practically nothing was left _ only some metal change, keys, etc.'' In another development, the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said Saturday that scientists have abandoned efforts to re-establish contact with an unmanned satellite sent to examine Mars. That meant the Soviets have lost touch with both Phobos spacecraft launched at a cost of $ 480 million. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the decision to discontinue attempts to reach Phobos-2 was made by a commission investigating why contact had been lost March 27. Contact with the Phobos-1 Mars probe was lost in September because an erroneous command was beamed to the spacecraft from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. For many years the official news media did not report failures in the Soviet space program. <PERSON> Ogonyok </PERSON> said it now was possible to report the circumstances of the R-16 disaster because of the greater openness permitted under President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s glasnost campaign.

 The halter created by design student <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Teggatz </PERSON> does n't cover a lot of flesh, but it packs a lot of protection. The top and matching knee-length pants and gauntlet-style gloves are made of a bulletproof, fire-resistant material, Kevlar 29. `` I do n't think there are any practical uses, unless <PERSON> Cher </PERSON> might be interested, or maybe a punk rock group,'' said <PERSON> Teggatz </PERSON>, a senior at <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. But practicality is beside the point. The halter will be among many unusual items going on display next week at Focus, the university's annual arts festival that prizes the creative over the marketable. `` The idea is to show that at this highly technical institution there are quite a few original ideas,'' said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, coordinator of the exhibit at the school known mainly for business, engineering and agricultural studies. Ms. <PERSON> Teggatz </PERSON>, 22, says her halter will be displayed on a mannequin, although real live models have given it a try. `` They have laughed, but they've been pretty agreeable,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Teggatz </PERSON> also will display a wedding dress made from radiation-resistant fabric. `` It's really quite sturdy,'' she said. `` The material is thin like paper, but it does n't rip. It's quite easy to work with.'' The material, which like the Kevlar is made by <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>, is used for garments worn by workers in nuclear plants. After exposure to radiation, the garment is discarded. `` I've had people tell me that since the wedding dress is almost a papery-like substance that would get thrown away after use, maybe it could be used for all the disposable weddings in society anymore,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Teggatz </PERSON> cherishes the opportunity to stretch her creativity to bizarre extremes while she can. `` I'll have to settle down soon enough,'' she said. `` You ca n't make money being too creative.

<HEAD>Hard-Nosed Salinas Fights Corruption That Threatens His Power</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 By having <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s reputed No. 1 drug lord arrested, President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> again surprised cynics who had initially considered his pledge to fight high-level corruption an empty campaign promise. In what amounted to a coup against the oil workers union, <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> used the army to arrest allegedly corrupt union leaders in January. He jailed stockbrokers accused of fraudulent practices a month later. This month, alleged drug kingpin <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallardo </PERSON> was arrested. It is all part of <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>' battle to regain the confidence of Mexicans who blame corruption for seven years of lost economic opportunity. If he fails, some analysts say, his <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> could lose its hold on power. Such observers hold that <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> has been on the attack since taking office Dec. 1 because he has no choice. `` <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> has to go against his own government, its own collaborators, to regain legitimacy. He realizes that if the patronage system continues, it's going to collapse in upon itself,'' said <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Villar </PERSON>, a political scientist at the <ORGANIZATION> Colegio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION> and adviser to <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>' predecessor, former President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>' election in July was the most disputed in the history of the party, which has governed <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> since it was founded 60 years ago. He won just more than half the vote, but reports abounded of multiple voting, stolen ballot boxes and other fraud. `` The results of July 6 were as much a rebellion against corruption as they were against the government,'' <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Villar </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> faces a skeptical public; every Mexican president in recent decades has come into office boldly declaring their intention to battle corruption. He has inherited cynicism over the failure of his predecessors to tackle corruption fueled by the oil-boom years. Many still bitterly criticize <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Portillo </PERSON>, claiming he and his allies stole the country blind _ claims <PERSON> Portillo </PERSON> denies. He was followed in 1982 by de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, `` the last president who held public confidence that he could confront corruption, and he lost it,'' <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Villar </PERSON> said. De la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>'s campaign for honest government failed, `` so corruption spread extraordinarily,'' <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Villar </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> has been forced to attack the very elements that, with <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> patronage, have kept the party in power. Oil union chief <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON> and stockbroker <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Legoretta </PERSON> were considered untouchable before <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> jailed them. In drug trafficking havens, top dealers were sometimes called `` narco-politicians'' _ before April 8, when <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> had <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallardo </PERSON> thrown in jail. He also had army troops arrest hundreds of police in <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallardo </PERSON>'s home town of <LOCATION> Culiacan </LOCATION>, sweeping up officials who allegedly protected the so-called `` godfather'' of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s cocaine trade. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>' threat to follow up those arrests with more in other states where drug trafficking is strong sent dozens of law enforcement officials scurrying for cover, according to news reports. `` De la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> went after marginal people; <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> is going for the central figures,'' <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Villar </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> is up against a centuries-old mix of corruption that has infested <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s traditional authoritarian structure of government. In his recent `` La Capital: The Biography of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kandell </PERSON> writes of the turn-of-the-century: `` Gendarmes were forced to prey on the poor in order to cover kickbacks demanded from them by their higher officers. That system continues today, with cars with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> license plates favored targets for a quick shakedown.'' Decades later, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> police Chief <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Durazo </PERSON> recruited known drug traffickers, smugglers and car thieves to create `` a more proficient racketeering empire,'' <PERSON> Kandell </PERSON> says. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> also has staked his presidency _ and the continuation of his party's claim to authority _ on his ability to pull <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> out of seven years of economic crisis that has sliced paychecks in half. `` Corruption is worst where the economic activity is most strategic,'' <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Villar </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>, a Harvard-educated economist, jailed <PERSON> Legoretta </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON> because `` the brokerage firms, like the oil workers union, were n't filling a productive role in the economy.'' Indeed, Mexican officials hope to gain billions of dollars in extra profits from a more efficient, less corrupt petroleum industry. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>' crackdowns have earned <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> kudos from the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, whose help he needs to reduce <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s growth-strangling $ 107 billion foreign debt `` His credibility in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has soared,'' says political scientist <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguilar </PERSON> <PERSON> Zinser </PERSON>. Whether that translates into electoral gains at home remains to be seen.

 A winery worker sought in the killings of his wife, two daughters and four other people was an angry, jealous man who spied on his wife and had threatened `` to blow her head off,'' a friend said. <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON>, 28, was so possessive of his wife that he drove home from work several times a day to check on her, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON>'s next-door neighbor in <LOCATION> Boyes </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hot </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> and friend. Authorities on Sunday concentrated their search for <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON> north of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and alerted the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Border Patrol, fearing he could head for his native <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. `` The cost of this is substantial, but we'll pay anything to get this man into custody,'' said <LOCATION> Sonoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Michaelsen </PERSON>. `` His acts are those of a totally insane person.'' On Sunday, the owners of the Grand Cru Winery where <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON> worked as a forklift operator offered a $ 5,000 reward for information leading to his capture. `` These atrocities have caused fear and terror to invade an area known for its beauty and hospitality,'' <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bettina </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreyer </PERSON> said in a statement. On Friday, officers discovered the bodies of <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON>'s 24-year-old wife, <PERSON> Angela </PERSON>, at their home; his mother-in-law and her two young daughters at their home in <LOCATION> Cotati </LOCATION>; and a winery co-worker The girls had been raped and sodomized, and one was nearly decapitated, authorities said. The next day, the bodies of two of <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON>'s daughters were found at a dump with their throats slashed. The throat of his 3-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Carmina </PERSON>, also was cut but she survived and told police her father had done the slashings. On Tuesday, only three days before her death, his wife learned he had been married before and had another child born only a short time before their own oldest daughter, the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Times reported today. After learning of her husband's other life, Mrs. <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON> said she wanted to leave him, the newspaper said. `` ` Now I can get an annulment,''' next-door neighbor <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> quoted Mrs. <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON> as saying. <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON> also was a regular seller and user of cocaine and possibly amphetamines, the Times reported, quoting several of his acquaintances it did not indentify by name. On Thursday night, <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON> stayed out drinking until 2 a.m., then snorted cocaine with a friend, the newspaper said. Sheriff's investigators said detectives had no information that <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON> sold drugs. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> described <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON> as being extremely jealous. `` Anybody who was higher up than him or if he had a nicer car than he did _ he did n't like that. He wanted to be No. 1,'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. He also said the Salcidos had recently begun arguing loudly. Once, he said, he heard Mrs. <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON>, an aspiring model, cry out, `` Living with you is like living in jail! You wo n't let me go out!'' `` I could hear them yelling. ... I guess I knew -LRB- the killings -RRB- were coming. I heard him say, ` I'm going to blow your head off,''' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. `` He blew up _ I had a feeling he would,'' said <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>. `` He told me he had a gun and he was ready to use it if he ever needed.'' <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON> also was upset recently because he was served papers ordering him to pay nearly $ 6,000 in overdue child support and to make monthly payments of $ 511 for a 4-year-old daughter in <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. Despite reports of <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON>'s having problems at work, his boss, <PERSON> Dreyer </PERSON>, remembered him as `` very cooperative'' and `` quick to please.'' `` He never caused any problems for anybody,'' said <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Brunhagen </PERSON>, a patron at <PERSON> McNeilly </PERSON>'s bar in <LOCATION> Boyes </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hot </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON> was a regular customer. `` If we had had 30 bar patrons like <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON>, there'd be no problems.'' Investigators still have not determined a motive for the slayings and have n't worked out their sequence, <PERSON> Michaelsen </PERSON> said. `` We hope the young daughter of the suspect can put some light on it,'' the sheriff said. Money and gifts poured into a hospital where <PERSON> Carmina </PERSON> was recovering from surgery. `` I've been told she'll make a full recovery. It was reported to me her vocal cords were not cut,'' <PERSON> Michaelsen </PERSON> said.

 In one blood-drenched day, terror struck the lush, rolling hills of this famous wine-producing region as seven people were either shot to death, bludgeoned or had their throats slashed. <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON>, 28, is being sought in the carnage that included his wife and two young daughters, his mother-in-law and two of her daughters, and a winery co-worker. One of his daughters, 3-year-old <PERSON> Carmina </PERSON> <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON>, survived despite her throat being cut nearly ear-to-ear.

<TEXT>
 Over the objections of the regional army commander, political leaders ordered troops to break up a pro-independence rally in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> was quoted as saying. At least 19 people were killed in the April 9 clash in the Georgian capital, <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>. In the Baltic republic of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, thousands rallied Sunday to mourn the victims. And at a rally in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, human rights activist <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> led about 500 people in a minute of silence for the dead. In a report Sunday, Pravda quoted <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> as saying the curfew in the southern republic could be lifted today. <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> has generally been quiet, though tense, since the deaths. An 11 p.m.-to-6 a.m. curfew imposed after the demonstrations has been cut back to midnight to 5 a.m., local activist <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Dandurov </PERSON> said by telephone. During the unrest, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said the army `` marched and was stationed in certain places under orders given by the leadership of the republic,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Pravda reported. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said the decision to use troops to quell the protests was opposed by Col. Gen. I.N. <PERSON> Rodionov </PERSON>, commander of a region that includes <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. `` The commander said the function the troops were ordered to perform was not the responsibility of the army,'' Pravda quoted <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> as saying in a speech Friday to the <ORGANIZATION> Georgian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. On Friday, the republic's party chief resigned after accepting responsibility for the April 9 clash in a main square of <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>, and the republic's premier was also fired as a result. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> was sent to the region to help restore order. He is a native Georgian and former chief of the republic's <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. State-run <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> said 20 people died and more than 150 were injured in the April 9 clashe. The official Georgian news agency <PERSON> Gruzinform </PERSON> said the death toll remained at 19. In <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>, residents turned out Sunday for the final two funerals for the victims, said <PERSON> Gruzinform </PERSON>'s deputy director, <PERSON> Zurab </PERSON> <PERSON> Lomidze </PERSON>. About 30,000 people rallied Sunday in the Lithanian city of <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION> in memory of the dead, according to <PERSON> Valdas </PERSON> <PERSON> Anelauskas </PERSON>, a local journalist for the dissident paper Express-Khronika. Speaking in a telephone interview, he reported that protesters carried banners saying, `` The <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> is a band of headchoppers'' and `` Let the bloody communist system be cursed.'' No arrests or violence were reported. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, said during the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> rally that he blamed the bloodshed in <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> on measures adopted last summer in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> requiring advance permission for demonstrations. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, who is running for a seat in the new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, said he would fight to revoke the decrees if elected. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has witnessed a resurgence of regional nationalism under President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON>, who wrote the 1973 ruling legalizing abortion and will hear arguments next week on a challenge to that decision, said he's been getting lots of mail on the subject. <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON>, appearing at a symposium Saturday night, refused to comment on the possibility that the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> this term could overturn the decision that resulted from <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>. The high court is scheduled to hear arguments in Webster vs. <ORGANIZATION> Reproductive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> on April 26. The case involves a federal appeals court ruling that struck down key provisions of a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> anti-abortion law declaring that human life begins at conception. Last September, <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> told law students at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION>, `` there's a very distinct possibility'' that <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> will be overturned by the high court because `` you can count the votes.'' The associate justice said Saturday night he had been getting `` voluminous'' mail on the subject, with some people branding him `` morally rotten'' and `` responsible for the deaths of more babies in the history of world.'' Asked about his philosophy of law, <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> said, `` I think we need some compassion in judgments. Let me just leave -LRB- my constitutional philosophy -RRB- at that.'' The symposium marked the 50th anniversary of the late <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>' appointment to the high court. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> served longer than any other justice in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history.

<HEAD>Voters Uphold Amnesty For Troops Under Military Rule; Reject Prosecution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED McCULLOUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In a nationwide referendum, Uruguayans voted to retain an amnesty for soldiers and police accused of torture and murder during 12 years of military rule that ended in 1985, official returns showed today. The outcome of Sunday's vote was a victory for President <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanguinetti </PERSON> on an issue that had divided the nation for more than two years. He had predicted trouble if the amnesty, approved in 1986 after rumblings in the barracks, were rejected. Soldiers who faced similar prosecution in neighboring <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> have staged three revolts in less than two years. With 7,009 of 7,072 districts nationwide reporting, amnesty supporters tallied 1,008,925 votes, or 52.57 percent, while opponents numbered 770,221 or 40.13 percent. About 140,049 votes, or 7.3 percent, were blank, annulled or ruled questionable for technical reasons. <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> `` definitely has turned the page on the past,'' a relieved Vice President <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarigo </PERSON> said as the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> released official returns early today. `` There were no winners or losers.'' About 180 soldiers and police had been accused of crimes during the dictatorship's war against leftist rebels. Thousands of suspected leftist sympathizers were arrested and tortured, 150 were killed and 200 were never seen again. The governing <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> noted that in addition to the December 1986 amnesty for soldiers and police, leftist Tupamaro guerrillas were released from jail shortly after <PERSON> Sanguinetti </PERSON> took office in March 1985. Early today a co-president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> for a Referendum, a coalition of human rights and leftist political groups that collected more than a half-million signatures to bring about the referendum, conceded defeat. But a disheartened <PERSON> Matilde </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Larreta </PERSON>, whose politician husband was assassinated by security forces in 1976, also called for a `` national compromise'' on the issue. `` The country and all its institutions can not be insensitive to the circumstances that nearly one-half of the population disagrees radically'' with the amnesty, she told reporters. The decision was accepted quietly by the public. There was no gloating by the victors or caravans of honking cars or fireworks such as occurred in December, when the <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said the referendum would be held. <PERSON> Sanguinetti </PERSON> last year predicted the amnesty law would survive the referendum, saying overturning it carried the likelihood of a `` long, hazardous ... and dramatic period of confrontation'' between soldiers and civilians. The law was enacted as civil courts were about call military officers to answer charges of murder, kidnapping and torture. Officers indicated they would ignore requests to testify, setting up a potential clash with the government. The same issue in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> has led to three unsuccessful military insurrections there in the past 20 months against the government of President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>. Official figures indicated that more than 83 percent of the 2.3 million eligible voters cast ballots. Voting is mandatory and failure to do so is punishable by a small fine. Supporters of the amnesty cast yellow ballots; opponents cast green ones. The `` greens'' did best in <LOCATION> Montevideo </LOCATION>, which is home to almost half the electorate, the traditional stronghold of the leftist parties. In the countryside, `` yellows'' dominated by margins of 2-1 or more. <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, secretary general of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said the government intimidated citizens into voting for the amnesty. The government `` developed a campaign seeking to build up elements of fear and uncertainty of what would happen if the ` greens' won,'' he told reporters. `` This campaign did n't take hold in <LOCATION> Montevideo </LOCATION>, but it did in the countryside.'' <PERSON> Sanguinetti </PERSON>, who was elected in November 1984 after democracy was restored, said before the vote that the country should concentrate on the future, including national elections set for Nov. 26. Not all Uruguayans agreed. Standing in line waiting to vote in the upper middle class neighborhood of Pocitos, a well-dressed woman said: `` A country that forgets its past has no future. A future of peace and justice depends on overturning'' the amnesty. She declined to give her name.

<TEXT>
 The dollar declined against the Japanese yen for the third consecutive day today, while share prices rose to yet another record high on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The dollar closed at 131.83 yen, down 0.62 from Friday's close. It opened at 131.75 yen and ranged between 131.55 yen and 131.88 yen. The dollar has fallen 1.02 yen in the last three trading days. Currency dealers said the prospect of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates topping out worked against the dollar. `` Major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic indicators released last week were within the market's anticipated range, but now dollar-denominated interest rates such as -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- Treasury bonds will be in a downward direction in the long-term perspective,'' said a dealer at the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday the nation's trade deficit in February widened to $ 10.50 billion, up from a revised deficit of $ 8.68 billion for January. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said industrial production was unchanged in March from the previous month. Both figures were largely in line with advance estimates. Another dealer with a major Japanese bank said trading was `` relatively quiet'' ahead of the release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consumer price figures in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Tuesday. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues, an 86.50-point gainer Friday, added 157.89 more points, or 0.48 percent, closing at a record high 33,308.33 points. Dealers said some investors remained unenthusiastic because of uncertainty over <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s political situation, but heavy buying by trust fund managers toward late afternoon lifted the Nikkei index. `` It is a difficult time for investors to make new orders,'' said a dealer with <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` But the market's fundamentals are not so bad.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is boosting imports of shoes, boots, soap, toothpaste and small tape-players this year to make up for chronic shortages on store shelves, a newspaper report said. The weekly Arguments and Facts, in its April 15-21 edition, quoted Deputy Trade Minister <PERSON> Suran </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarukhanov </PERSON> as saying officials have added $ 8 billion to this year's $ 51.2 billion fund for imports of consumer goods. The money will go for 15 million pairs of leather shoes, 12 million pairs of warm women's boots, 300 million razor blades, 10 million compact cassette players, as well as clothing, soap and detergent, toothpaste and other goods, <PERSON> Sarukhanov </PERSON> was quoted as saying. `` Our partners were amazed ... at our uncharacteristic urgency,'' <PERSON> Sarukhanov </PERSON> was quoted as saying. Soviet officials have signed agreements with <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, he said.

<TEXT>
 Hundreds of students in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> marched today to mourn the death of former <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON>, an outspoken reformist toppled by conservatives two years ago. `` Long live <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON>, long live democracy, long live freedom, long live the rule of law!'' chanted more than 600 students from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s Political Science and <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. Marching behind a huge red flag bearing their school's name, the students laid wreaths in Hu's honor at the base of a monument to Communist martyrs in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, the symbolic seat of power in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hu </PERSON>, who died Saturday at age 73 after suffering a heart attack, was regarded by intellectuals as favoring greater artistic and scholarly freedoms than other Chinese leaders. While a crowd of several thousand looked on, the students sang the Internationale and chanted slogans for about half an hour before dispersing. `` We just want to express our grief over <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON>'s death because he was a great leader and his death is a loss to the nation,'' said one student. `` We are n't making any political statement.'' But another student, <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhixun </PERSON>, said the students were expressing `` an attitude'' of dissatisfaction with the failure of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leaders to institute democratic reforms. `` <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON> dared to speak out, and he said things we students supported,'' <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, more than 1,000 students marched late Sunday from <ORGANIZATION> Fudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Tongji </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, singing former odes to revolutionary leader <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON> but substituting <PERSON> Hu </PERSON>'s name. The demonstration lasted more two hours and broke up early this morning, said <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurpado </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, who is teaching English at <LOCATION> Fudan </LOCATION>. Students at three other schools in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, including the nation's leading school, <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, put up hundreds of posters on their campuses over the weekend to express sorrow over <PERSON> Hu </PERSON>'s death, demand that his ouster be reassessed and call for greater democracy. Authorities in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> have made no efforts to interfere with the student activities, the largest display of student unrest since the student marches of 1986-87 that led to <PERSON> Hu </PERSON>'s ouster. In the late 1970s Hu supervised the party's rehabilitation of thousands of people wrongly jailed during the far-left Cultural Revolution, including many scholars. He was ousted as party chief in 1987 for allegedly encouraging `` bourgeois'' Western influences in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and failing to quash nationwide student pro-democracy marches that year.

<TEXT>
 A group of dolphin-loving environmentalists recline on the sand with eyes closed and meditate, opening their minds to receive telepathic messages they say the playful marine mammals send them. `` We're offering a true and profound experience with nature,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, 28, who directs Project Delphinus Internaional from his rented seaside home 50 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. As a group of the intelligent sea mammals surfaces near kelp beds visible from his window, <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> lifts an 8-inch conch shell and blows, sending a deep bellow across the water. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> says the unorthodox group set up shop to document communication between dolphins and humans in hopes the information will further their environmental goals. He said if people truly believe they can communicate with dolphins they will treat the animals with greater respect. `` Once you do that, how can you throw a beer can on the beach, or shoot a dolphin because he's eating your squid?'' <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> asked. The project was founded in 1987 by <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurley </PERSON> with the goal of filming a documentary on dolphins to help end their slaughter by fishermen. Group activities include meditation sessions on the beach, wilderness excursions and dolphin-watching boat trips and environmental talks. They also send a quarterly newsletter to about 3,000 people statewide. Project members believe the rituals of Australian aborigines, Polynesian natives and other ancient cultures can help modern man reunite with nature. To honor those rites and pay homage to dolphins during boating trips, group members sound the conch shell horns and beat drums lined with goat bellies to duplicate the way some ancient tribes called the seagoing mammals that are renowned for the grace and intelligence.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> today brushed aside an offer by communist rebels to declare a cease-fire if she pledges to close <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases, and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador called the proposal a bid to weaken her government. The rebel <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> offered Sunday to declare a unilateral cease-fire in the 20-year insurgency and open peace talks if Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> vows to close the six <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases when their lease expires in 1991. `` As I have said, if we want a cease-fire then let's have a cease-fire first without any conditions,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, who has refused to say if she will support an extension of the lease. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> also raised doubts about who really was authorized to speak for the rebels: `` Until we can find out once and for all who is the leader who can speak for all of them, it is really very difficult to sit down with anybody.'' The rebel statement, which was delivered to news organizations, was signed by <PERSON> Satur </PERSON> <PERSON> Ocampo </PERSON>, one of two rebel negotiators in short-lived peace talks in 1986. <PERSON> Ocampo </PERSON> made similar proposal in an interview last month. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Sison </PERSON>, founder of the banned <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philippines </ORGANIZATION>, also gave the same statement in a videotaped interview from <LOCATION> Utrecht </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, where he has sought asylum. <PERSON> Sison </PERSON>'s interview was broadcast over local television two weeks ago <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> said today that the rebel offer was aimed at undermining U.S.-Philippine relations and weakening the Aquino government. `` They realize that these bases and these facilities perform a very important economic role, and they want to do anything they can to weaken the government,'' <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> said in an interview with radio station <ORGANIZATION> DZRH </ORGANIZATION>. `` And so they are working hard to try and arrange for this relationship to end,'' he added. <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would close the bases if the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> government wants them out. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> maintains <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> and Subic Bay Naval Base, two of its largest facilities overseas, and four smaller installations in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. More than 60,000 Filipinos are employed at the bases, where about 40,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops and their dependents are stationed. The rebel statement said that if the Aquino government were to close the bases by 1991 and promise no further agreements for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases, `` the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> would not hesitate to immediately declare a unilateral cease-fire and enter into negotiations for a comprehensive political settlement and a peaceful end to the civil war.'' But if the government refuses, the rebels said they were determined `` to make <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imperialism pay dearly for the continued stay of its bases and its increasing intervention in our people's affairs.

<DATELINE>LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A 10-foot-high bullet barrier is being built alongside a schoolyard to protect teachers and students from frequent street gunfire. Construction of the 300-foot-long concrete wall at <ORGANIZATION> Lindbergh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Junior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> begins this week, its $ 160,000 cost financed by the school district and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. `` It's really sad that something like this has to be done. But it's needed in today's society,'' said <PERSON> Principal </PERSON> <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Fraley </PERSON>. One side of the school, where the recreation areas abut the 713-unit Carmelitos Housing Project, has been vulnerable to gunfire. Physical education teachers say the wall is long overdue. When it is completed, teacher <PERSON> Trish </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said, she will celebrate by hanging a sign reading: `` The Great Wall of <LOCATION> Lindbergh </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, another physical education teacher, said she has seen beer bottles and even bicycle handlebars tossed at students during her 25 years at the school. But, she added, `` now, it's not what they're throwing but what they're shooting.'' Last week, students were evacuated from the recreation fields twice because of gunfire. Two years ago, in the only shooting in which someone was hurt, a student playing basketball after school was hit in the chest by a bullet and seriously hurt. `` We got angry. This is ridiculous. This is enough, we said. We're taking our classes out there and we have to convince the kids that it's OK, when we are not sure it's OK,'' <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said. `` Anything for the safety of the kids, but I think that $ 160,000 in law enforcement would do more to ease crime,'' said <PERSON> Carmelitos </PERSON> resident <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, 28. Describing the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> projects, police Sgt. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillissie </PERSON> said, `` We're there all the time'' because of drugs and gang-related activities. <PERSON> Wesley </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, chief of police for the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unified </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>, said the wall was `` a novel idea, but I do n't know if it is the solution to the problem.''

 A cold front driving into the nation's midsection spread rain and thunderstorms from <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> to the lower <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> and produced light snow further north. Temperatures dropped sharply in some northern states as cold Canadian air moved down behind the front.

<HEAD>Dollar Falls on Signs U.S. Economy Slowing, Gold Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar fell against all major currencies in early European trading today on growing signs that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic growth is slowing, dealers said. Gold prices were also lower. `` The dollar is low and calm,'' said one Italian trader, attributing the dollar's steep decline over the weekend to the market's perception that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates have peaked. Last week's figures showing the growth rate in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> producer prices slowed in March and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit widened in February were interpreted as a signal for slower economic growth and perhaps lower <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates, dealers said. `` Major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic indicators released last week were within the market's anticipated range, but now dollar-denominated interest rates such as -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- Treasury bonds will be in a downward direction in the long-term perspective,'' said a dealer at the Bank of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> in the Japanese capital. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar fell 0.62 yen to a closing 131.83. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted higher at 132.15 yen. Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Friday: _ 1.8595 West German marks, down from 1.8725 _ 1.6405 Swiss francs, down from 1.6510 _ 6.2910 French francs, down from 6.3350 _ 2.09625 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1145 _ 1,363.90 Italian lire, down from 1,374.25 _ 1.1855 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1875 In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound rose to $ 1.7080, compared with $ 1.7000 Friday. Bullion dealers said gold failed to get support from the weaker dollar. `` Gold is in a bearish mood at the moment,'' one <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> dealer commented. `` There is a lack of faith in the market after its recent dismal performance.'' Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 385.50 a troy ounce, down from $ 386.50 bid late Friday. At midmorning today, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $ 385.15 In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, gold was selling at a bid $ 385.20, down from $ 387.00 late Friday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold rose 71 cents to close at a bid $ 386.74. Silver was quoted in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> today at a bid price of $ 5.81 a troy ounce, down from Friday's $ 5.87.

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A court today ruled Solidarity legal again, officially ending a futile seven-year attempt by Communist authorities to eradicate the Soviet bloc's first independent workers' movement. A three-judge panel in a <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> provincial court handed down the decision to register Solidarity in the same room where the union movement led by <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> had its original charter approved in November 1980. There was thunderous applause when the court completed the about-face approved by Polish leader Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, who had tried to dissolve Solidarity in a December 1981 martial-law crackdown but now seeks the movement's help to pull <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> out of economic crisis. Several Solidarity sources hinted that a meeting might take place between <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> and <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> on Tuesday. `` I am happy that we've just returned on the road of democracy and freedom,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said after hearing the decision at his home in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, where he is recovering from a bad cold. He planned to travel to <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> later in the day. With Solidarity registered, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> planned to fly Wednesday morning to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> to thank Polish-born Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> II for the Roman Catholic church's role in helping to broker the agreement with authorities. The last step in the long bid for restoration of the union movement followed intensive negotiations between authorities and the Solidarity-led opposition that ended April 5 with far-reaching accords. The bargain grants Solidarity and other long-banned groups legalization in exchange for opposition participation in party-dominated parliament elections in June. It also creates the first freely elected legislative chamber in the Soviet bloc _ a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> which will have veto power over the current unicameral parliament, or Sejm, where authorities will maintain a majority. As the court session ended, hundreds of hands lifted in the `` V'' for victory sign and chants of `` Solidarnosc, <ORGANIZATION> Solidarnosc </ORGANIZATION>'' filled the room. The Solidarity leaders beamed and the judges shook hands with the participants. Two long Solidarity banners were held up through the hearing before Presiding Judge <PERSON> Danuta </PERSON> <PERSON> Widawska </PERSON>, about a dozen key Solidarity activists and 300 spectators. Outside the courtroom another 100 supporters waited. `` Today means for me the restoration of justice,'' said <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, the senior Solidarity adviser who led the delegation that submitted the application. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, who was on hand for Solidarity's first legalization in 1980, added, `` I hope I will not have to come here a third time.'' The Rev. <PERSON> Henryk </PERSON> <PERSON> Jankowski </PERSON>, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s close adviser, said he came from his <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> church to `` verify'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s words at the funeral of pro-Solidarity priest <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Popieluszko </PERSON>, slain by the secret police: `` You gave your life so Solidarity could live.'' Solidarity had a stormy 16-month legal existence before it was suspended by <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>'s martial-law decree of Dec. 13, 1981, which led to the interning thousands of activists and the 11-month detention of <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>. The union that once claimed the membership of one in three Poles officially was banned in October 1982 but never ceased to function _ first as an underground organization and then more openly after a 1986 political amnesty took effect. The Communist party says its decision to legalize Solidarity again results from changes in the political situation over the years that open the possibility for a more responsible union devoted to trade union issues and not politics. Party and government officials also admit they hope that legalizing the union will encourage the West to reschedule <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s massive foreign debt and ease the pressure on the struggling economy President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> scheduled a speech today in the heavily Polish-American community of <LOCATION> Hamtramck </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, to unveil new economic package for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrov </PERSON>, an artist and photographer denied permission to emigrate for eight years, said today he is being allowed to leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` I have my passport in my hand,'' <PERSON> Petrov </PERSON>, 36, said by telephone.

 Americans overwhelmingly believe that outlawing abortion would do little to curtail it, and half want the operation to remain legal and unrestricted in early pregnancies, a poll has found. The <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General-Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> poll of 1,108 adults also found broad opposition to <ORGANIZATION> Operation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION>, whose members have been blocking entrances to abortion clinics around the country. With the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> poised to reconsider its 1973 <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> decision that legalized abortion during the first three months of pregnancy, 53 percent in the random-sample survey said they favored that landmark ruling. Moreover, if the court were to reverse itself and let each state make its own abortion laws, 57 percent said they would want abortion legal in their state. Thirty-seven percent would want it illegal and 7 percent were unsure. The poll posed the issue in a variety of ways because the wording of questions on a sensitive issue can affect the results. The findings on basic attitudes toward abortion were similar in other recent polls. But in a new finding, large majorities said outlawing abortion would fail to prevent it. Abortion proponents argue that many women would have unsafe illegal abortions if the procedure were banned. The poll asked: `` If abortion were illegal in your state, do you think that would stop most women there who want abortions from having them, or would most of them go to another state where it was legal?'' Eighty-seven percent said the women would go to another state. The poll then asked whether banning abortions nationwide would stop most women from having them, or if those women would have illegal abortions or go to a country where abortion is legal. Seventy-three percent said women would find a way to have abortions. The survey found its closest split on the question of a constitutional amendment to make abortions illegal except in cases of rape, incest or to save the life of the mother. Fifty percent were opposed and 44 percent in favor, a division within the poll's 3-point error margin No such amendment is before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, but those are the terms President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he would support. In another question on conditions under which abortion may be permitted, the poll asked: `` Should abortion be legal as it is now; legal only in such cases as rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother; or should it not be permitted at all?'' Fifty percent said legal as now; 39 percent said only in certain cases; 7 percent wanted it banned outright and the rest were unsure. That question has been asked since 1985 by the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll, which has found a slight increase in support for current law. Depending on the questions, however, other polls have found slight declines in support for abortion, and others still have found no movement. In a question outside the legal context, the Media General-AP poll asked: `` If a woman wants to have an abortion and her doctor agrees to it, should she be allowed to have an abortion, or not?'' Sixty-five percent said yes, 25 percent said no and the remaining 10 percent had no opinion. The CBS-Times poll has found a similar and steady response to that question since 1980. Opposition to abortion was greatest among older, less wealthy and less educated respondents, and Republicans and conservatives. There was no significant division in opinions between men and women. The federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> say 1.3 million abortions are performed annually in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, making it one of the nation's most common surgical procedures. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> next week is to hear a case that could enable it to review its 1973 ruling legalizing abortion. The Media General-AP survey also found: _ Sixty-seven percent were opposed to demonstrations by Operation Rescue _ Narrow opposition to use of federal funds to help poor women with their medical bills if they want an abortion Forty-nine percent were opposed to such spending, 41 percent in favor. The rest did not answer. _ Support for legalization in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of a new pill, RU 486, which halts a pregnancy by cutting off a hormone necessary to keep an egg implanted in the uterus Anti-abortion activists call the drug an abortion pill, and have threatened boycotts against its producers. Supporters of the pill, which is available in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, call it simpler and safer than surgical abortion. In the poll, 51 percent said it should be legal here; 24 percent said it should not; 25 percent were unsure. The poll was conducted March 6-15 by the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a communications company based in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, that publishes the Richmond Times-Dispatch, the Richmond News Leader, the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> -RRB- Journal, and operates TV stations <ORGANIZATION> WXFL </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, WCBD in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> WJKS </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>.

 Thieves have returned one of three <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON> paintings they stole from a museum in hopes of obtaining a $ 2.5 million ransom, police said today. No ransom was paid for `` The Loom,'' which was taken from the <ORGANIZATION> Kroeller-Mueller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> in December and recovered unharmed April 6 from the trunk of a car parked near the home of the museum's director, police spokesman <PERSON> Theo </PERSON> <PERSON> Reus </PERSON> said. The return of the painting and dealings with the thieves had been kept secret but police decided to publicize the events today because a newspaper learned of the negotiations, <LOCATION> Reus </LOCATION> said. The thieves returned `` The Loom'' to prove they were possessed the other two stolen art works, `` Wilted Sunflowers'' and an early version of `` The Potato Eaters.'' He said no ransom has been paid and the whereabouts of the remaining two paintings is unknown. The total value of the three works has been estimated at $ 100 million to $ 125 million. On Dec. 12 the thieves smashed a museum window and stole the paintings. The three works were not insured by the state because of the high premiums that would be required. Police and art experts have said it would be nearly impossible to sell the paintings because they are so well known.

<HEAD>Couple Charged with Prostitution Say Sex Is Their Religion</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A couple offering sex to followers of their Church of the Most High Goddess say their arrests on prostitution-related charges violate their religious freedom. Will and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> were arrested last week, Mrs. <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> for investigation of prostitution and her husband for investigation of pimping. Both are free on $ 2,000 bail. Mrs. <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON>, 46, said she and other `` priestesses'' absolve the sins of male followers with sex acts in what she claims is a revival of ancient Egyptian religious rites. Her husband said followers must contribute money or services to take part in the rituals. `` Anything God wants from me, I will give him,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> said. `` If he wants me to be monogamous, I'll be monogamous. If he says go have sex with 20,000 men, I'll do it.'' <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON>, 51, said he will ask that the charges be dismissed on grounds of freedom of religion. `` If you accept money for a sex act, it's prostitution,'' said Detective <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanderpool </PERSON>. The couple live in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clarita </LOCATION>, 30 miles from downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, but operate their church out of a four-bedroom, Spanish-style rented house near <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>. The sparsely furnished house has no pews or pulpit. The few wall hangings include posters of movie stars and a nude photograph of Mrs. <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON>. The priestesses wear strapless red-sequined dresses, fish-net hose and black spiked heels.

 Authorities were investigating the cause of a suspicious fire that swept through a historic, century-old loft building, destroying millions of dollars worth of art and at least eight galleries. All that remained today of the six-story, block-square warehouse designed by the noted <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> architect <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> was a brick shell. Witnesses said Saturday's fire began in at least two spots, `` and very seldom do two fires break out simultaneously,'' said Fire Department spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheppard </PERSON>. Gallery owners said the <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> art district should recover quickly from the fire. `` The major galleries will be back in business,'' said dealer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Straaten </PERSON>, who lost $ 3 million in prints in the blaze, including works by Americans <PERSON> Jasper </PERSON> <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Rauschenberg </PERSON>. The fire struck as dealers were preparing for the annual Art Expo spring exposition next month at <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pier </ORGANIZATION>, which attracts art dealers from around the world and is considered the most important annual show for <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s art community. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Straaten </PERSON> estimated that the combined loss to all the galleries in the building could total as much as $ 50 million. `` I am totally wiped out,'' said <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Santlofer </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> artist who spent two years on the 13 paintings and drawings he had hanging in one of the galleries when the fire struck. `` I may try to do something like it again, but I wo n't be able to do it exactly the same,'' said <PERSON> Santlofer </PERSON>, whose abstract paintings used religious motifs. The building was constructed in 1885 and had been recommended for landmark status by the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Landmarks </ORGANIZATION>. In recent years, it was the linchpin of the burgeoning <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> area, which is filled with restaurants, nightclubs and dozens of galleries.

 The 100th anniversary of the birth of <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>, whose work brought him fame but not acceptance by the art world's elite, received a spirited celebration in his home state. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>'s admirers cut cake and drank toasts Sunday on the lawn of the <LOCATION> Nelson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gallery </LOCATION>, where a major retrospective opened. `` <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> is still speaking to a large crowd,'' curator <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said as 4,000 to 5,000 people toured the exhibit of almost 90 paintings. `` This is a very bold show, in that it maintains that <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> was a major force in <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> art that has been overlooked,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said.

 Former hostage <PERSON> John-Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON> today accused <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> of weakness for refusing to negotiate the release of journalist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> and other British citizens held captive in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` Put yourself in his place,'' <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON> told a meeting to mark the third anniversary of the kidnapping of <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, 32, a television reporter abducted on his way to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> airport. `` His country, <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, has abandoned him. British officials say they wo n't negotiate because it will only lead to the taking of other hostages. I say you can negotiate without giving in.'' The French and West German governments managed to secure the release of their hostages without being brought to their knees, <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON> said at the meeting organized by British and <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> journalists. <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON>, a magazine writer and French citizen, was freed in May 1988 after more than three years' captivity. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, which was under constant pressure to get back its hostages, has denied paying ransom. It complied with several Iranian demands, including banishing the main Iranian opposition group from <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON> said he recently helped mark the start of the fifth anniversary in captivity of <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 42, the chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> and the longest held of 15 Western hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` There's something cruel in these anniversaries,'' he said. Today's meeting at <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION> headquarters was organized by British and French journalists. Those at the meeting issued an appeal to all with influence `` to do whatever they can immediately to help secure their release.'' Organizer <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Brock </PERSON>, a British writer, said the appeal would be sent to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> and the Iranian and Syrian embassies in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> influences Moslem extremists holding the hostages, while <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> is the main foreign power broker in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. A group working for <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>'s release ran cinema, television and newspaper advertisements today. One asked movie goers in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to close their eyes and think of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> because <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> has `` done nothing else for the last three years.'' In a message with Arabic voice-over on Lebanese television, the hostage's mother, <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON>, said: `` Three years of fear, grief and loneliness is a long time. Three years is a long time in a young man's life.'' His father, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON>, told his son, `` Whatever you do, old chap, keep your spirits up.'' They published similar messages in the <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> daily As-Safir. Another message in the newspaper, signed `` Jill'' and apparently from <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>'s girlfriend, <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> Morell </PERSON>, said: `` I wish more than anything that you could be back home with us. But until then, I'm sending you all my special love.

<TEXT>
 Two men found buried one atop the other on a communal farm were killed by the same cult of drug smugglers that sacrificed 13 people and buried the mutilated corpses at a ranch nearby, authorities said. The two bodies found Sunday were in an orchard two miles from <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elena </LOCATION>, where the other corpses were dug up last week. The 72-year-old father of one of the two victims led police to the bodies. He said some children had told him last fall they had seen people burying a body, but he discounted the story until the 13 corpses were dug up, authorities said. Police believe <PERSON> Rancho </PERSON> <PERSON> Santa </PERSON> <PERSON> Elena </PERSON>, about 20 miles west of <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>, was where a cult performed sacrifices and other rites to protect their drug smuggling from police and rivals. The bodies found last week had been dismembered, and their hearts, brains and other organs removed for use in rituals, police said. The bodies found at the communal farm Sunday had not been dismembered, said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON>, a federal judicial police group chief who supervised Sunday's exhumations. A sheriff's deputy in <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> city across the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>, said the deaths apparently were drug related. <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON> said police had long suspected the two men of selling drugs. That suspicion, plus the proximity of the grave to the ranch, led <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON> to believe they had done business with the cult before it turned to committing human sacrifices. Four men being held in <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION> in the 13 other slayings had not been questioned about the newly found bodies, <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON> said. He added they were to be interrogated after a court appearance today. <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON> said police then would determine whether to search for more bodies. <PERSON> Serafin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, <PERSON> Elio </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Serna </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> were to be formally charged today with murder, kidnapping and drug and weapons possession, authorities said. The cult's leaders, <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON>, 26, and <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON>, 24, were still being sought, police said. <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON> allegedly ran a marijuana-smuggling ring that sneaked a ton of the drug into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> weekly, officials have said. Federal police in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> said they were investigating possible links between the killings and recent slayings in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, but had found nothing yet. On Sunday, officers inspected a garden across the street from <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON>'s luxurious house in <LOCATION> Atizapan </LOCATION>, 13 miles north of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, for signs that bodies might have been buried, but found nothing. `` They would n't be stupid enough to bury them here anyway,'' said one officer who spoke on condition of anonymity. On Friday, federal police searched <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON>'s Atizapan house and the apartments of two associates who are fugitives. They found a couple of marble altars, but no signs of human sacrifice. Neighbors said three to five young men suddenly fled the house in late-model luxury cars early Tuesday, the day the first 12 bodies were found. One of the four suspects captured that day led police to a 13th body Thursday. Like most of the victims found at <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elena </LOCATION>, the two men found Sunday had been struck in the back of the head with a machete, said <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Delgadillo </PERSON>, an employee at the <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION> funeral home where the bodies were taken. <PERSON> Delgadillo </PERSON> had watched while a doctor examined the remains Sunday night. `` The bones were whole. They were not dismembered,'' <PERSON> Delgadillo </PERSON> said. `` One ca n't tell if the hearts and other organs were removed, because the bodies were decomposed. It's pretty revolting.'' <PERSON> Delgadillo </PERSON> dug up the bodies as police stood around, took pictures and cracked jokes. The bottom body was clad in black pants and snakeskin boots. A pants pocket contained a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> $ 5 bill and 3,000 Mexican pesos. Little was left of the remains but bones.

 <PERSON> Toni </PERSON> <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> is a former Austrian ski champion and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> national downhill champion, but he says he is remembered most for one legendary mad dash down <PERSON> Tuckerman </PERSON> <PERSON> Ravine </PERSON> 50 years ago. `` I got more mileage out of that race than all the rest of them put together,'' he said Sunday on a nostalgic return to the mountain on the 50th anniversary of his famous schuss in the Inferno Race. <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> said he `` never skied anything like it and I do n't think anyone else has either ... because it drops off so fast.'' <PERSON> Tuckerman </PERSON> <PERSON> Ravine </PERSON>, on 6,288-foot <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, is only a small portion of the four-mile race. Its most notable feature is the headwall, with a 1,000-foot drop at angles that reach 65 degrees. <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> made a straight run down the ravine. <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, the late broadcaster who witnessed the event along with 2,000 spectators, described it this way: `` The first racers took a good three or four swinging, high-speed turns on the headwall to check their speed. But when <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> came bolting over the edge, because it was so steep, he knew a turn would n't slow him down _ he schussed the wall like a lead plummet hitting 85 miles per hour as he came streaming off the bottom, his skis shattering the icy snow.'' <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> reeled through the bottom of the trail, just missing a tree before finishing the run in 6 minutes, 29.4 seconds. That was a full minute faster than runner-up <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Durrance </PERSON> and smashed the previous record of more than 13 minutes. World Cup downhill races last about two minutes, and racers average about 75 mph. `` I do n't remember anything about it,'' said the 69-year-old <PERSON> Matt </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Pawling </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> `` It goes so fast. It only takes a few seconds from time you see the headwall and you're halfway down, and before you know it, it's all over. `` I was n't frightened. I was used to speed, although not that fast, and I was in good shape,'' he said. The race was discontinued after <PERSON> Matt </PERSON>'s 1939 feat because of unpredictable weather.

<TEXT>
 A third auto maker halted production today in response to a wave of strikes by workers seeking higher wages. Officials said the job actions threaten the nation's economy. <ORGANIZATION> Daewoo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a joint venture between the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Daewoo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, stopped its assembly line today after a walkout at its parts suppliers. Similar protests forced two other car makers _ <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Kia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> _ to stop production last week. Government officials said the actions by the three manufacturers will slash <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s auto exports, projected at 650,000 cars this year. Also today, 5,000 taxi drivers rallied in a park to press demands for higher wages and improved working conditions. The drivers threatened to strike next week unless their demands are met. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has been hit by 431 worker strikes for higher wages and benefits so far this year and 133 are still in progress, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said today. Government officials said strikes were spreading to nearly all manufacturing industries and small firms. Police raided offices of labor activists and dissidents today and seized thousands of leaflets in a crackdown on strikes. About 50 labor activists have been arrested. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Kun </PERSON>, head of the state-run <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Korea </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is unlikely to achieve its economic growth target of 8 percent this year, partly because of the strikes. Average wages in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> increased by 20 percent in 1987 and 1988, harming the international competitiveness of Korean products, he said. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> registered a trade surplus of $ 94 million for the January-March period, far below $ 1.35 billion in the same period last year. In March alone, imports exceeded exports by $ 1 million, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s first monthly trade deficit in 19 months. In the worst labor unrest this year, thousands of riot police stormed <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heavy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s largest shipyard, on March 31 to end a 109-day strike. The police action in the southeastern industrial city of <LOCATION> Ulsan </LOCATION> triggered violent protests by angry workers that lasted about two weeks and left hundreds of workers and policemen injured.

 Gov. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON> called the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> back to work today to take up a measure that would protect <ORGANIZATION> Parole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> members from being sued for crimes committed by freed inmates. Lawmakers during the three-day special session will also consider a $ 79 million building program. The two proposals died in the closing days of the 1989 regular session, which ended two weeks ago. The new <ORGANIZATION> Parole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> would have five full-time members with immunity from liability. The current board has four part-time members and a full-time chairman who meet several days a month. Momentum for restructuring the board built after a state judge last year ordered three members to pay $ 3 million to a banker shot and paralyzed by a parolee. The judgment is being appealed. The restructuring measure died on the last day of the regular session after <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON> threatened a veto if it included an amendment barring appointment of anyone who contributed $ 500 or more to any campaign of the appointing governor. A proposal to issue bonds for capital improvements and property purchases failed partly because some legislators were reluctant to add to the state's indebtedness.

<HEAD>Court to Decide if States May Tax TV Evangelists Sales of Merchandise</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to decide whether states may tax television evangelists' sales of religious books, tapes and other merchandise. The justices said they will review rulings that forced the Louisiana-based <ORGANIZATION> Jimmy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swaggart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION> to pay <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> $ 183,000 in back taxes and interest for the years 1974 through 1981. Lawyers for <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s organization argue that the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> tax, as applied, violates religious freedom. A state appeals court rejected that argument, and the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> turned down an appeal by <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s lawyers last Nov. 17. The disputed state sales and use tax is imposed on `` retailers'' for the privilege of selling personal property in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, and on the consumption of products. The tax was imposed on sales by the <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> ministry during crusades in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and sales made through the mails. For the years at issue, mail-order sales from <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> consumers totaled $ 1.7 million. Sales of merchandise at <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> crusades totaled $ 240,000. The appeal acted on today argued, `` What could be a clearer violation of the free exercise of the religion of the religious adherent than to tax that adherent for exercising the right to use the religious material distributed by the evangelist.'' The appeal relied heavily on a 1943 ruling in which the nation's highest court overturned the convictions of <PERSON> Jehovah </PERSON>'s Witnesses who violated a city ordinance requiring all people engaged in door-to-door canvassing to get a license and pay a fee The <PERSON> Jehovah </PERSON>'s Witnesses were distributing religious literature. The court said in its 1943 ruling, `` This form of religious activity occupies the same high estate under the First Amendment as do worship in the churches and preaching from the pulpits.'' The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> appeals court acknowledged the 1943 ruling and said, `` Evangelism, whether by age-old methods or by new technologies, is protected by ... the First Amendment.'' But the appeals court said the 1943 decision and other past <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rulings have banned flat licensing taxes on religious endeavors. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> did not equate a financial burden in and of itself with an unconstitutional burden on the exercise of religion,'' the state court said. The appeals court noted that in a 1983 decision striking down a <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> tax as discriminatory against certain newspapers, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said, `` Our cases have consistently recognized that nondiscriminatory taxes on the receipts or income of newspapers would be permissible.'' The state court concluded: `` A religious organization which seeks to disseminate its religious message through sales ... should not enjoy rights to communicate and distribute their message superior to those of other organizations having social, political or other ideological messages to proselytize such as newspapers.'' The case is <ORGANIZATION> Jimmy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swaggart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> vs. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equalization </ORGANIZATION>, 88-1374.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Accepts California Tax Case on Multinationals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to settle some key questions involving the ability of multinational corporations to challenge state taxes in federal court. What the justices decide sometime next year in a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> case could carry big-money significance for most states and many big businesses. The court, granting an appeal by <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> officials, said they will review a ruling that allowed two multinational corporations to challenge a state tax in federal court. In a 1984 ruling seen as a major victory for states, the justices ruled that <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> may tax multinational corporations based on the businesses' worldwide income. But that decision applied only to multinationals whose parent company is located in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The case acted on today involves multinationals whose parent company is based in a foreign country. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s business tax _ the same levy upheld in the 1984 ruling _ was challenged by <ORGANIZATION> Alcan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aluminium </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Limited </ORGANIZATION>, a Canadian corporation, and <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, a British corporation. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> taxed subsidiaries of the multinationals doing business in the state. The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> tax employs what is known as the unitary system. The method bases the tax on a share of worldwide earnings, payroll and property value of each multinational and its subsidiaries. At issue in the appeal acted on today is whether multinationals based abroad have legal standing to challenge such unitary state taxes in federal courts in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Alcan </ORGANIZATION> and Imperial challenged the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> tax in a federal court in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Franchise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> has an office. A federal judge threw out the suits on grounds that the parent companies claimed they were injured only in their capacity as shareholders of their subsidiaries _ and therefore lacked legal standing. Generally, shareholders are barred from suing in such cases unless they can demonstrate `` a direct and independent injury'' from the corporation. The 7th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> last October overturned the judge's decision againt <ORGANIZATION> Alcan </ORGANIZATION> and Imperial, reinstating their suits. The appeals court said there is grounds for the parent companies to assert a direct and independent injury. `` Shareholders with direct, personal interests in a cause of action can bring suit even if the corporation's legal rights and obligations are also implicated,'' the appeals court said. The asserted injuries to <ORGANIZATION> Alcan </ORGANIZATION> and Imperial are direct and independent, the appeals court said, because `` the unitary tax diminishes the attractiveness of owning <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> subsidiaries in comparison with entering into contracts with independent companies as a means of engaging in foreign commerce.'' The appeals court added: `` The potential for the unitary tax to penalize foreign ownership of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> assets distinguishes'' it from other forms of state regulation _ environmental or safety rules, for example _ that `` would presumably affect foreign and domestically owned operations fairly equally.'' The appeals court said taxes like the one imposed by <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> `` have fueled a simmering trade controversy which has raised concerns about foreign retaliation and the -LRB- <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' -RRB- ability to speak with one voice on matters of foreign commerce.'' Most states and the <ORGANIZATION> Multistate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> joined in supporting <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s appeal. The commission said the 7th Circuit court ruling's effect is to permit multinational corporations to `` forum shop'' around the country for a sympathetic federal judge who will permit the businesses to challenge the state taxes. The case is <ORGANIZATION> Franchise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Alcan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aluminium </ORGANIZATION>, 88-1400.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, in an important banking industry case, today asked the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration for its view on whether <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks with branch offices overseas must pay depositors after foreign governments seize or freeze those accounts. The court invited <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers to comment on rulings that required <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> to pay depositors. The justices are not expected to say whether they will grant full review to the case until hearing from the government lawyers, which could take months. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>, a former federal judge whose <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> nomination was defeated by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1987, is representing <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION>. If the court were to grant review, <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> might become the first defeated nominee in the court's history to later argue a case before the justices. In the appeal acted on today, <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> said billions of dollars are at stake. There are more than 900 branches of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks operating in 73 countries, with some $ 225 billion in deposits. The cases acted on today stem from the fall of <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, to the <LOCATION> Vietcong </LOCATION> in 1975 and economic troubles in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> in 1983. The Vietnamese case involves an account at <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION> office opened in 1974 by <PERSON> Quang </PERSON> <PERSON> Quy </PERSON> <PERSON> Trinh </PERSON>, a retired South Vietnamese government official. The account, which paid annual interest of 19 percent compounded daily, was for <PERSON> Trinh </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Ngoc </PERSON> <PERSON> Quang </PERSON> <PERSON> Trinh </PERSON>, a student in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> at the time. The deposit agreement between <PERSON> Trinh </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> said the bank did not accept responsibility for any loss due to `` government orders, laws ... or from any other cause beyond its control.'' <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> closed its <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION> branch on April 24, 1975, on the eve of the city's fall to communist troops. The elder <PERSON> Trinh </PERSON> was placed in a re-education camp by the new regime, and after he was released in 1980 sent the <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> passbook to his son in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. The younger <PERSON> Trinh </PERSON> sued the bank to recover the deposits. The 6th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> last July upheld a ruling that <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> must pay Trinh $ 3,196.36, including $ 1,792.69 in interest. The appeals court rejected <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION>'s argument that its deposit agreement excused it from paying deposits lost because of political revolution. The agreement the elder <PERSON> Trinh </PERSON> signed did not mean he was `` aware that he had given up his right to proceed against the home office -LRB- of <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- in the event the branch was no longer in existence and could not pay its depositors,'' the appeals court said. It added that both <PERSON> Trinh </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> are innocent parties in the case, but one must suffer a loss. In the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> case, <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Limited </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> deposited $ 2 million with the <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> branch in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> in June 1983. The money was to be repaid with interest six months later. But on Oct. 15, 1983, the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> government of <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> _ who was deposed and fled to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> in 1986 _ froze the accounts of foreign banks. The move prevented <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> from repaying the <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> deposits to <LOCATION> Wells </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> <PERSON> Fargo </PERSON> sued to recover the money, and <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> later paid it $ 934,000. <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> withheld the balance of the original deposit. A federal judge in 1987 ordered <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> to repay the balance in 1987, and the 2nd <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upheld the ruling last July. The appeals court relied on an agreement between the two banks that suggested <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION>'s home office in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> had the duty to pay the money. The cases are <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> vs. Trinh, 88-1031, and <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> <PERSON> Fargo </PERSON>, 88-1260.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to consider reinstating the murder conviction of a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> man who confessed to killing his former girlfriend after police illegally arrested him at his home. The court said it will review a ruling that threw out <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' conviction because his confession was used as evidence against him. The ruling is being appealed by <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> prosecutors. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> last October ruled that <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> is entitled to a new trial on charges stemming from the stabbing death of <PERSON> Thelma </PERSON> <PERSON> Staton </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Staton </PERSON>'s body was found in her apartment Jan. 11, 1984. Police were told by Ms. <PERSON> Staton </PERSON>'s daughter that <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> had kidnapped the victim several days earlier and had raped her before letting her go. Police said they went to <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' apartment five days after discovering Ms. <PERSON> Staton </PERSON>'s body, with probable cause to believe <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> was the killer. But they did not have an arrest warrant. After knocking on <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' door and receiving no answer, one officer went down a fire escape to a window and announced that the police had arrived. Other officers at the front door, with guns drawn and badges displayed, then were allowed by <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> to enter. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> was given his so-called <PERSON> Miranda </PERSON> warnings that he had a right to remain silent and have a lawyer's help. Police said <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> then poured himself a glass of wine and confessed to killing Ms. <PERSON> Staton </PERSON>. He was arrested and taken to the stationhouse where, about one hour later, he gave police a written confession. A trial judge ruled that <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' confession at the apartment could not be used as evidence because his arrest _ made without a warrant and in violation of his privacy rights _ was unlawful. But the judge permitted prosecutors to introduce as evidence the stationhouse confession, ruling it was not tainted by the illegal arrest. The connection between the arrest and the stationhouse confession was sufficiently `` attenuated'' to permit its use, the judge ruled. But the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, the state's highest court, ruled that the stationhouse confession was a direct byproduct of the unlawful arrest. The state court relied heavily on a 1980 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that said police must have a warrant to arrest someone at home unless some emergency exists. The justices in that case barred from being used as evidence a bullet casing found at a murder suspect's home. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> court said the 1980 ruling means `` the fruits of illegal entries must be suppressed even though the police might have probable cause to conduct a search or effectuate an arrest outside the home without a warrant.'' The case is <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> vs. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, 88-1000.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to study a `` strike'' by lawyers in the nation's capital who sought higher pay to represent penniless criminal defendants. The court said it will hear an appeal by federal officials who say the lawyers violated antitrust law. The <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> here organized a boycott in 1983 to pressure the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> government to increase hourly compensation the city pays attorneys who represent indigent criminal defendants. Some 100 lawyers who represent most of the city's poor criminal defendants had been receiving $ 30 an hour for time in court and $ 20 an hour for out-of-court work. They won a $ 25 per hour increase after a two-week boycott in which nearly all them refused to accept new cases. The boycott created a crisis for the city, swamping the the city public defender's office with criminal cases. The city government agreed to the higher hourly rate at an annual cost to taxpayers of more than $ 4 million. The private lawyers who boycotted represent 85 percent of the poor defendants. The remaining defendants are represented by the public defender service, third-year law students or, in a small number of cases, lawyers volunteering to work without pay. After the so-called strike, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> ruled that the lawyers engaged in price-fixing and an illegal boycott. The <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> ordered the lawyers not to engage in similar conduct in the future. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> here set aside the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> decision and ordered the agency to restudy the case to determine whether the lawyers had exerted `` market power'' in their boycott. Alleged antitrust violators are considered to be exerting market power if they are capable of exercising economic control over a relevant market. The appeals court here said it was unclear whether the boycott succeeded because the lawyers exercised market power or political clout. `` Power of some sort was surely exercised,'' the appeals court said. `` The city council approved a rate increase it had long refused two weeks into a boycott that disrupted the court system and generated significant publicity.'' The appeals court said the lawyers may have succeeded, even though they lacked market power, by changing public attitudes and making it politically safe for the city council to raise their pay. The boycott may have succeeded because it was persuasive rather than coercive, the appeals court added. Also, the appeals court said, the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> must judge the lawyers `` with a special solicitude'' because free-expression rights protected by the Constitution are involved. The lawyers said the boycott was an exercise of their First Amendment rights to petition the government for a redress of grievances. In appealing to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> said the appeals court ruling sets a dangerous precedent. The ruling `` erects formidable new barriers against antitrust challenges to publicly conducted price-fixing boycotts,'' the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The tax-paying public, no less than private parties, is entitled to have its monies spent in markets in which all participants obey the laws of competition.'' The cases are <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, 88-1198, and <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION>, 88-1393.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Upholds Federal National Guard Training in Massachusetts
Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today refused to bar the federal government from requiring certain peacetime training for any state's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> troops without first getting the governor's consent. The justices, without comment, left intact a 1986 federal law prohibiting governors from withholding permission for such training missions. The law had been challenged by <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> officials. Today's action does not preclude the possibility that the issue could some day return to the nation's highest court. Since 1933, each person joining the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> simultaneously enlists in two distinct organizations _ the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> of a particular state and the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The first organization serves as the state's militia; the second as a reserve component of the national armed forces. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 passed the so-called Montgomery Amendment after several governors voiced opposition to the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's Central American policy and said they would withhold their consent to <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> training missions in that region The 1986 law prohibits any governor from withholding consent to a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> unit's active duty outside the country because of an objection to the location, purpose or schedule of such duty. A <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> unit in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> was designated to participate in a <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> training mission in mid-1988, but Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> objected. State officials sued the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> in federal court, alleging that the 1986 law is unconstitutional. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keeton </PERSON> upheld the law, and the 1st U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> agreed last Oct. 25. The dispute centered on seemingly competing provisions in the Constitution. One enpowers <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` to raise and support armies,'' including `` calling forth the miltia.'' The other leaves to individual states the `` training of the militia.'' Judge <PERSON> Keeton </PERSON> ruled that a state's authority to train <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> members must yield to `` the legitimately exercised power of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to raise and support armies.'' <PERSON> Keeton </PERSON>'s ruling relied, in part, on a 1918 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision that upheld <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' authority to draft members of a state militia into the national armed forces during World War I. The judge discounted arguments by <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> authorities that a state's authority to supervise the training of <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> members is absolute during peacetime, and can be taken over by the federal government only in times of national emergency. A three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> declared the Montgomery Amendment unconstitutional after the law was challenged by <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON>. That ruling currently is under review by the entire 8th Circuit court. Urging the justices to reject <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' appeal, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration lawyers said, `` It would be incongruous to hold that the Constitution gives <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> the power to establish these reserves as components of the national armed forces but ... withholds -LRB- federal -RRB- authority ... to conduct their training.'' The administration lawyers added, `` Such a view would not only undercut the effectiveness of the national defense but would also inject the states into matters of foreign policy that the Constitution reserves to the federal government.'' As of 1986, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> members provided 46 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s combat units and 28 percent of its support forces. For fiscal year 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> members provided 73 percent of the nation's air defense interceptor forces and 25 percent of its tactical fighter forces. The case is <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>, 88-1223.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today ordered the dismissal of a challenge to a rule that generally requires <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> city court employees to speak only English while at work. The justices instructed the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> to take such action after being told that the woman who challenged the rule no longer works for the city court. The rule was adopted by the southeast judicial district of the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1984. The rule bars court employees from speaking any language other than English, except when acting as translators or during breaks and lunchtime. The regulation was challenged by <PERSON> Alva </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON>, a Hispanic-American who was a deputy court clerk. Ms. <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON> is bilingual, and one of her duties was to translate for Spanish-speaking members of the public that have business before the city court. She said the English-only rule discriminates against her and other minority group members based on their race and national origin. The 9th Circuit court last year upheld a federal judge's injunction barring enforcement of the rule pending further developments in Ms. <PERSON> Guitierrez </PERSON>' suit The appeals court also rejected arguments that the city judges who adopted the rule are immune from being sued. The appeals court said while some employees who speak only English may feel threatened by conversations in Spanish between other workers, that is no legitimate basis for a discriminatory policy. `` Existing racial fears or prejudices and their effects can not justify a racial classification,'' the appeals court said. The fears of people who do not understand Spanish do not amount to a `` business necessity'' warranting the ban, the appeals court said. It noted that the federal <ORGANIZATION> Equal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opportunity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> properly has warned that barring workers from speaking their native tongue on the job may contribute to racial tension. Acknowledging that the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Constitution has been amended to recognize English as the state's official language, the appeals court said the amendment is primarily symbolic and does not mandate that English be the only language spoken by public employees. The case is <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON>, 88-1395.

 A jailhouse lawyer whose litigation helped transform the <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penitentiary </LOCATION> is free after 21 years behind bars. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> `` Bud'' <PERSON> Balla </PERSON> was released from the prison south of <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION> on Friday. He was not scheduled for release until August, but Corrections Director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> said <PERSON> Balla </PERSON> had found a job and a place to live, so officials let him go. In 1984, <PERSON> Balla </PERSON>, who had only a high school education, and fellow inmate <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartzmiller </PERSON> won a federal court victory declaring the 680-inmate prison overcrowded and lacking in basic services. The suit brought about improvements at the prison and construction of a new maximum-security facility. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> lawyer <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Pevar </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> called the court-mandated reforms `` the single most important thing that has happened'' to <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> prisons. Corrections officials reluctantly agree, although they dismiss most of <PERSON> Balla </PERSON>'s prison-rights suits as frivolous. `` Every state has their <LOCATION> Balla </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> said. `` He just happened to be <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>'s.'' <PERSON> Balla </PERSON>, 44, was sent to the penitentiary in 1968 for robbery. He escaped and was recaptured three times and was serving time for slashing a guard's throat during a breakout in 1978. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Kodiak </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, contractor who knew <PERSON> Balla </PERSON> when they were teen-agers in <LOCATION> Medford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, told officials that the inmate would have a job and a place to live if he came to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Balla </PERSON> was granted early release. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said he had forgotten <PERSON> Balla </PERSON> until a few months ago when he read about an inmate complaining about the prison cable TV system failing during the Super Bowl. `` He's got capabilities,'' <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said. `` It's too bad he's spent so much of his life wasting away in prison.'' Between connecting flights in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Balla </PERSON> called The <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Statesman </LOCATION> to say, `` I'm free and I do n't know how to act.'' `` I've got an opportunity and I'm going to make it work,'' he said.

 Fires burned out of control in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s devastated streets today after artillery and rocket exchanges between Christian and Moslem fighters killed 41 people in less than 48 hours Police said 156 people were wounded in the bombardments that began at dusk Saturday between army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s largely Christian army units and his Syrian and Druse adversaries Police said the bombardment was the heaviest since the battles broke out March 8, plunging <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> into a fierce round of fighting some fear may be the `` final battle'' in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year-old civil war. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON>, called for an emergency meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> council to take `` urgent measures ... to stop the massacre in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' The sheik, who heads an <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> mediation committee on <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, called the meeting after three cease-fire appeals by his six-man panel failed to curb the hostilities. The latest casualties raised the overall toll from 41 days of almost non-stop bombardment by both sides to 258 killed and 913 wounded, by police count. <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> was without electricity and the water-pumping system came to a standstill after the capital's main power plants were shut down at noon Sunday when they ran out of fuel. Among those killed during the weekend was <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s ambassador, <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Aristegui </PERSON>. The 61-year-old diplomat died Sunday along with his wife's Lebanese father and sister and a bodyguard when his villa suffered a direct hit. The envoy's wife, <PERSON> Jomana </PERSON>, suffered severe head wounds when the 240mm shell struck their home in the <PERSON> Hadath </PERSON> suburb of Christian east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. She was hospitalized in critical condition. <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> residents had hardly emerged from basements and bunkers during a brief lull this morning when the guns and rocket launchers thundered into action again, sending people scurrying back to their shelters. A few bakeries opened today, but there was not enough bread for residents who ventured out to replenish food supplies. Hundreds of burned-out cars lay smoldering on streets littered with broken glass and severed power cables. Hundreds of shops and other buildings were gutted. Fires burned out of control in several residential districts of <LOCATION> Christian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, where police said more than 1,200 autos were destroyed by shellfire in the latest blitz. Many buildings burned down because fire engines had no water to battle the fires. The nine-story <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> building, which also houses the state-run Radio <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> station, was gutted by a barrage of 30 artillery shells. The station remained off the air for a second day. The smoke-blackened building is next door to the office of acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, who heads a mostly Moslem Cabinet that is vying for legitimacy with a <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> military <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> headed by <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> met today with <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s visiting Minister for Humanitarian Assistance, <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kouchner </PERSON>, who is trying to arrange a mercy mission to evacuate casualties and bring in fuel and medical supplies. A source close to <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a dozen Moslem victims of the fighting might be evacuated from west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> hospital ship, <PERSON> Rance </PERSON>, at nightfall `` if security conditions permit.'' Fourteen Christians were ferried to the Rance on Friday. The fighting was touched off by a blockade <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> clamped on illegal militia-run ports that have cost the government about $ 100 million a year in lost customs revenue. The <ORGANIZATION> Druse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> retaliated by shelling the Christian enclave. The Syrians, who maintain 40,000 troops in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Moslem areas under a 1976 Arab League mandate, soon joined the Druse in fighting the Christians.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s slightly altered plan to protect deposits in failed savings and loans will consume the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s attention this week, while Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s troubles and the recommended closing of 86 military bases dominate House action. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan would cost a minimum of $ 157 billion, two-thirds of it from taxpayers, over the next 10 years to shore up the government's deposit insurance funds after raids on it by often-fraudulent savings and loan operators. The S & amp; L insurance fund is at least $ 25 billion in the hole because of overly speculative loans, insider deals and in some cases outright thievery by thrift operators using federally protected deposits. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee charged today that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> violated official rules of conduct 69 times by not disclosing thousands of dollars in alleged gifts and by skirting rules on speaking fees through bulk book sales. The committee also cleared <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> of several allegations, including one that he improperly intervened with <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L regulators on behalf of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> thrift operators and friends. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> also is scheduled to vote Tuesday on a resolution by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> lawmakers to reject a federal commission's recommendation last year to close 86 military bases. Among the base closings that would begin in 1990 unless the resolution is approved are the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dix </LOCATION> and Presidio bases in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Chanute </LOCATION> training base in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. Lawmakers hope to make this a shortened work week, taking off on Thursday to mark Passover. But with the S & amp; L deficit growing by an estimated $ 600 million to $ 1 billion a month, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, has vowed to bring them back on Friday if they do not complete action on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s package before the holiday. Lawmakers and presidential candidates in both parties closed their eyes to the problem during last year's election campaign while the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> was committing some $ 38 billion to close or merge more than 200 insolvent S & amp; Ls, half of them in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The bailout package before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would come up with the balance needed to pay for that, $ 50 billion more needed to handle another 350 institutions now or near insolvency plus another $ 33 billion to cover losses of additional thrifts expected to go under by 1999. Together, the costs _ none of which will ever be recovered _ are more than double the amount of aid, repaid loans and loan guarantees that the government put up for the <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> Plan to rebuild <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> after World War II and the <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> bailouts combined. Toward <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s stated goal of `` never again,'' the president's plan also would require S & amp; Ls effectively to double _ from $ 3 to $ 6 _ their own capital at risk for every $ 100 they lend as an inducement to be more prudent The legislation also replaces the independent and traditionally industry-friendly <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> with the stricter bank-insuring <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and a new <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> office as the industry's regulators. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> last week weakened <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s reform proposals somewhat by continuing to allow a variety of non-owner assets to count as capital through government-approved though widely criticized accounting practices. <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, the bank board's chairman, would keep his job under <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee's bill, but likely would lose it in a version moving through the House. Challenges to <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>'s continuance in office and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s financing plan, and an effort to set aside for poor and low-income families some of the housing that has fallen into the government's hands through <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L loan defaults, may surface on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor this week. Under <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan, the bailout will be financed with $ 50 billion raised through 30-year bonds to be issued by a new quasi-government corporation. This lets <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> avoid having to include the costs in his federal deficit calculations, while taxpayers pick up about $ 5 billion and the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L industry $ 300 million of the annual interest costs of the bonds. An on-budget, up-front financing plan by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Banking Chairman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, D-Mich., was defeated in committee last week despite <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>'s contention that it would have saved taxpayers $ 4.5 billion in interest costs over the next 30 years

<TEXT>
 A court today convicted a 23-year-old Palestinian of spying for the Moslem guerrillas who are trying to overthrow the country's Soviet-backed government. Meanwhile, guerrilla reports in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> claimed the insurgents had breached the southern defenses of the eastern Afghan city of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> after a six-week siege. However, diplomats in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, the Afghan capital, said the government may have succeeded in reopening the highway from the capital to <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>. The U.S.-backed guerrillas had destroyed a bridge to close the road during their offensive. In the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> trial, the <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> said the defendant, <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Razaq </PERSON>, deserved the death penalty. However, the court said it commuted his sentence to 16 years in prison because he asked for mercy. The court said he could appeal. The three-judge panel found the man guilty of illegally entering <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, military spying, collaborating with insurgents, and trying to persuade government soldiers to defect to neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Razaq </PERSON> admitted entering <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> illegally, but he said he came only to preach Islam. `` I am not a professional killer,'' he told the court. `` I came to make peace between two -LRB- guerrilla -RRB- commanders. I am not a spy. My objective was to remove tension between two disputing sides.'' He was arrested last December by government troops who stormed a guerrilla hideout in northwestern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, prosecutors said. He said his home was a Palestinian refugee camp in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. On April 5, the court convicted two Pakistanis of spying for their government. One was sentenced to 16 years in prison, the other to 18 years. The most powerful anti-government forces are based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, which supports their fight. The Afghan News Agency, mouthpiece of the seven-party guerrilla alliance based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, today quoted a guerrilla commander identified as <PERSON> Fazli </PERSON> <PERSON> Haq </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhajid </PERSON> as saying the insurgents had broken <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>'s stiff southern defenses. <ORGANIZATION> Al-Bunyan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, linked to the guerrillas' fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Ittehad-i-Islami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said battles raged around the headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> Afghan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s 81st Brigade south of the city. However, there were no immediate reports of casualties and no independent confirmation. The diplomats in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, gave no details in reporting the highway from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> may be open again. However, they said a convoy of about 65 trucks with weapons and ammunition left today for <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>. The city, where an estimated 100,000 people now live, was the guerrillas' first major objective since Soviet troops withdrew from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> two months ago. They had intervened nine years before in support of Marxist rulers. The city's capture would be a major morale boost for the guerrillas, who earlier predicted that the country's government would quickly collapse without the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s help. In other fighting today, government troops battled for the fifth day to dislodge guerrillas who had cut the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> highway running north from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The blockade has prevented hundreds of trucks carrying food and fuel from reaching the capital. The guerrilla reports also said there was heavy fighting near <LOCATION> Khost </LOCATION>, another eastern garrison town about 78 miles south of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>. They claimed guerrillas killed or wounded 350 government troops and captured five tanks, two armored personnel carriers, and some heavy weapons over the weekend. Those reports were also impossible to confirm.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, in a case involving a notorious Mexican drug-smuggling operation, today agreed to decide whether <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law enforcement agents need a warrant before searching on foreign soil someone who is not an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizen. The court said it will hear <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration arguments that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agents did not violate the Constitution when, without a warrant, they searched the home of a suspected Mexican drug smuggler. <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Verdugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Urquidez </PERSON> was convicted in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> last year of taking part in the 1985 kidnapping, torture and murder of Drug Enforcement Administration Agent <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> and his pilot, <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Zavala </PERSON> <PERSON> Avelar </PERSON>. <PERSON> Verdugo </PERSON>, identified as a top lieutenant to Mexican drug kingpin <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON>, is serving a sentence of 240 years plus life. He is not eligible for parole for 59 years, when he would be 96. <PERSON> Verdugo </PERSON>'s conviction and sentence in the murders is not at issue in the case the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> acted on today. His appeal centered on a separate drug-smuggling conviction. In other cases acted on the court: _ Agreed to decide whether states may tax television evangelists' sales of religious books, tapes and other The justices said they will review rulings that forced the Louisiana-based <ORGANIZATION> Jimmy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swaggart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION> to pay <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> $ 183,000 in back taxes and interest for the years 1974 through 1981. - Refused to bar the federal government from requiring certain peacetime training for any state's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> troops without first getting the governor's consent The justices left intact a 1986 federal law prohibiting governors from withholding permission for such training missions. The law had been challenged by <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> officials. - Asked the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration for its view on whether <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks with branch offices overseas must pay depositors after foreign governments seize or freeze those accounts The court invited <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers to comment on rulings that required <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> to pay depositors. At issue in the Verdugo case is whether the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> properly suppressed evidence obtained by the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> in its search of <LOCATION> Verdugo </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mexicali </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, home in 1988. <PERSON> Verdugo </PERSON> was arrested by Mexican police in 1986 and was turned over to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. While he was awaiting trial, the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> got permission from <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> authorities to search the home. The agents seized a tally sheet they said shows the quantities of marijuana smuggled into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by <LOCATION> Verdugo </LOCATION>. A federal judge in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> ruled that the evidence is inadmissible because the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agents failed to obtain a warrant in a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> court. The judge also said the search was unreasonable because it was too general, occurred after midnight and the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> failed to leave an inventory in <LOCATION> Verdugo </LOCATION>'s home of the evidence seized. The 9th Circuit court upheld the judge's ruling. The appeals court said the agents had a legitimate goal and praised them for `` aggressive and laudable pursuit'' of drug smugglers. But the appeals court said the agents are not free to ignore the Constitution's Fourth Amendment, which generally requires a court warrant before any government search of a home is conducted. While <PERSON> Verdugo </PERSON> is a foreign citizen who lived outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` he is being prosecuted for alleged violations of <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> law in a <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> court,'' the appeals court said. `` We can discern no conceivable reason why he should be denied the protection of the Fourth Amendment.'' The appeals court acknowledged that a search warrant issued by a judge in this country has no legal authority in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Nonetheless, the appeals court said, `` We can not relieve the government from its obligation to obtain a search warrant simply because the place to be searched ... is outside this country.'' A search warrant issued by a judge in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> demonstrates that an impartial magistrate believed there was probable cause to conduct the search, the appeals court said. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers said the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agents received assurances from <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> government officials that the search was lawful there without a warrant. The government's appeal said the 9th Circuit court ruling could have serious consequences for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law enforcement efforts on foreign soil. The <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> has offices in 45 nations, and last year helped in investigations that led to 1,200 arrests of suspected drug smugglers in foreign countries. The case is <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vs. Verdugo-Urquidez, 88-1353.

 Here, at a glance, is a rundown on the 69 instances of ethics violations which the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Standards of Official Conduct alleged Monday against <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>: _ That <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s friend and business partner, <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, real estate developer and investor <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>, improperly provided $ 145,000 worth of gifts over a 10-year period The committee found that <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> had a direct interest in legislation before the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, making it a violation of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules for <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> to accept more than $ 100 in gifts in a calendar year. _ That <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> failed to report the benefits he received from <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> as gifts on his annual financial disclosure forms The items deemed `` gifts'' by the ethics committee included free housing from 1979 through 1984 in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, valued at $ 31,698; cut-rate housing from 1985 through 1988, valued at $ 21,790; an $ 18,000-a-year salary paid to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON>, from 1981 through 1984, totaling $ 72,000; and the use and maintenance of a 1979 Cadillac from 1983 through 1988, valued at $ 19,391. _ That <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> had `` an overall scheme'' to evade <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> limits on outside earned income by, in seven instances, selling bulk quantities of his book `` Reflections of a Public Man'' to groups to which he had delivered speeches The panel said that action, in effect, converted money that should have been speaking fees _ limited under <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules _ into book royalties, which are not under the limits. In an eighth instance, the panel said, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> received an undisclosed gift because books paid for by a private individual were not delivered. Of the 116 total allegations of rules violations originally raised by the committee's outside counsel, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>, 47 were dismissed. Those involved <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s alleged lobbying on behalf of a constituent with whom he had an interest in oil and gas wells, lobbying of federal savings and loan regulators, using congressional staff members to produce his book, use of campaign funds to pay for the book's publication and loan transactions involving Mrs. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Marlene </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 President-elect <PERSON> Janez </PERSON> <PERSON> Drnovsek </PERSON> said today the spread of democracy in this communist nation can not be stopped and suggested the country could join a west European trade organization within five years. <PERSON> Drnovsek </PERSON>, a 38-year-old economist elected in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s first Western-style election, said a suggestion <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> join the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> was `` not realistic'' now. The call came from the official <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> youth union last week. But he said he could envisage membership in the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, whose members are <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> could adapt its terms of trade to those of the six-nation grouping over a five-year period, said <PERSON> Drnovsek </PERSON>. In a 90-minute meeting with reporters, <PERSON> Drnovsek </PERSON> took a largely conciliatory but anti-Serbian stance when answering questions about how to solve ethnic tensions and an economic and political crisis. <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, under its communist leader <PERSON> Slobodan </PERSON> <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>, wants to maintain a centralized, one-party system, measures it says will bring down the 400 percent inflation and a $ 21 billion foreign debt. In contrast, <PERSON> Drnovsek </PERSON> stressed that `` the concentration of economic power ... should not be confused with political centralization.'' He also spoke out against `` nationalist tendenices'' complicating the situation in the <LOCATION> Serbian </LOCATION> province of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, where riots killed at least 24 people last month. <PERSON> Drnovsek </PERSON> said his direct election as <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>'s representative to the nine-member collective presidency shows democratization `` has begun and will not stop.'' The spread of democracy `` may stop for a short while in one place or another ... but it can not be halted altogether,'' he emphasized. `` I am convinced that very soon we will arrive at a more liberal development in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. Anything else is unacceptable and could have tragic consequences.'' <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> hopes new liberal laws will encourage foreign investment, but <PERSON> Drnovsek </PERSON> said the country will continue trying to reschedule or write off debt repayments. He blamed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> budget deficit for high interest rates that he said complicate repayments. <PERSON> Drnovsek </PERSON> and the new representative from <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s smallest republic, <LOCATION> Montenegro </LOCATION>, were the only people directly elected to the collective presidency in Western-style elections. In <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Croatia </LOCATION>, representatives were named by the party and approved in rubber-stamp legislatures. The country's other two republics, <LOCATION> Bosnia-Herzegovina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Macedonia </LOCATION>, still are considering how to elect their representatives, who sit for five years. <PERSON> Drnovsek </PERSON> will serve one year as president.

 <LOCATION> COLUMBUS </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ An inmate who escaped from prison 28 years ago and lived under his father's name has returned to serve out his term. `` When I die, I want my own name on my tombstone,'' <PERSON> Sylvan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, 61, said in an interview in today's The Columbus Dispatch. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> surrendered at a <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> TV station last week and is being held at the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Correction Institution pending further action, <PERSON> Tessa </PERSON> <PERSON> Unwin </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correction </ORGANIZATION>, said today. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, convicted of possession of a burglary tool _ a crowbar _ in 1960, was sentenced to one to five years in prison. He walked away from an honor farm at the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> prison 30 miles west of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> in 1961. If convicted of escape, he could receive three years in jail. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said he has lived in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> since his escape and was known as <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. But after the death of his brother and his wife, he decided to turn himself in. `` What I really wanted to do was wait until the corn around <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> got 6 foot high and go into the cornfield and come out at the prison and tell everyone I got lost -LRB- for 28 years -RRB-. But I thought better of that idea,'' he said.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Bars New York Man from Pauper Appeals in Ohio Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 For only the second time in its history, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today permanently barred someone from appealing to it as a pauper after ruling that he failed to prove he can not afford the filing fees. The justices, by a 6-3 vote, ruled that <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Wrenn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Drum </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, may never again submit a so-called pauper's petition _ unless he can show his financial circumstances have changed significantly for the worse. Unless granted pauper status, anyone who appeals to the high court must pay $ 200 in filing fees plus significant printing costs. The court, in a four-page, unsigned opinion, noted that <PERSON> Wrenn </PERSON> has filed 22 appeals to the court since 1986 and the court has denied him pauper's status 19 times. One one occasion, <PERSON> Wrenn </PERSON> paid the $ 200 fee. <PERSON> Wrenn </PERSON>, who is black and works in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Wilcox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION>, said he was a victim of racial discrimination by the <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Wrenn </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> officials first refused to hire him as an assistant programs superintendent in 1978. Later, he was hired but said he then was fired in 1980 because of racial bias. In legal papers accompanying his appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Wrenn </PERSON> said his yearly salary is $ 27,700 and he is $ 60,000 in debt. The court once before issued a similar previous opinion, on Feb. 21 denying pauper status to a man who had appealed to the justices 73 times since 1971. The justices said today they have a responsibility to allocate the court's limited resources in the interest of justice for all. `` We do not think justice is served if the court continues to process -LRB- <PERSON> Wrenn </PERSON>'s -RRB- requests to proceed -LRB- as a pauper -RRB- when his financial condition has not changed from that reflected in a previous filing,'' the court said. In a dissenting opinion, Justice <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said the court was wasting more time by preparing and enforcing the order resticting <PERSON> Wrenn </PERSON>'s ability to appeal than would be `` consumed by the routine denial of frivolous'' appeals. Also dissenting were Justices <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>. They repeated past concerns that denying pauper status could be a dangerous precedent that cuts off worthy appeals. The court receives some 2,300 appeals a year by people who say they are too poor to afford the filing fees. The cases are <PERSON> Wrenn </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>, 88-6494, and <PERSON> Wrenn </PERSON> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, 88-6497.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> commemorated today as the 14th anniversary of the date it took power in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, and the communist guerrilla group also pledged to keep fighting Vietnamese invaders who later ousted it. Fears of a return to power by the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, which killed hundreds of thousands of people during its three-year reign, have heightened since <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> announced this month it will pull out its 50,000 troops by Sept. 30. `` Today ... our entire people put on their best clothes and joyously celebrate their national day ... with the firm conviction that their struggle will score final victory against the Vietnamese enemy aggressors,'' <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> radio said Sunday. The text of its broadcast was available today in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> ousted the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> when it invaded in late 1978 and installed a new communist government in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>. That government also marked the anniversary _ but not as a <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> triumph. Instead, <ORGANIZATION> Phnom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penh </ORGANIZATION> radio called the day a `` historic victory over the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imperialists and their lackeys'' in a broadcast monitored in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. It went on to say that <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> leaders betrayed this victory and `` plunged the Cambodian motherland into a deep ravine of deat.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> entered the capital, <ORGANIZATION> Phnom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penh </ORGANIZATION>, on April 17, 1975, toppling the U.S.-backed government of <LOCATION> Lon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nol </LOCATION>. Today, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> are key supporters of the <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> resistance, which unites the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> with two non-communist factions. After entering the capital, the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> dragged many residents to labor camps in the countryside. It eventually killed hundreds of thousands of Cambodians in its attempt to create a model agrarian society. In its broadcast, the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> station said <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> should bow to guerrilla demands and allow the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to monitor its withdrawal. The guerrillas have said the Vietnamese-installed government should step down. The station said <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>'s pledge to remove its troops was merely an attempt to deflect international criticism. It claimed <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> is hiding thousands of troops in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> by dressing them as Cambodian soldiers. <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Linh </PERSON>, chief of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, will go to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Thursday for talks with President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s pullout from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> news service reported today in a dispatch from <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is the main backer of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. In a letter today, about 1,000 survivors of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>'s labor camps and torture chambers asked leaders of the warring factions to incorporate human rights provisions into any peace settlement They said pledges are needed to ensure the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> horror is not repeated. The letter was sent to <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>, prime minister of the Vietnamese-backed government in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>; and to the two leaders of the non-communist guerrilla groups, Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> and Son <PERSON> Sann </PERSON>.

 In using his wife's career as a line of defense against ethics charges, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has struck a sensitive chord among his colleagues who fear they could be subject to the same scrutiny. `` Every member who has a spouse that works'' is concerned, says <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Majority Whip <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif. A major charge leveled by the 12-member <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee against <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> is that he accepted improper gifts from a business partner with interest in legislation, according to the committee's report released The panel viewed the $ 18,000 a year that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON>, received from a <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> business partner, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>, not as a salary for part-time investment advice but as a gift. House rules prohibit members from accepting more than $ 100 a year in gifts from anyone with direct interest in legislation. In a counterattack last week, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> described his wife's lengthy career, including her job with the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and cited the scores of other congressional spouses who work `` Some members' wives are attorneys. Some of them sell real estate. Some of them teach school. Some of them work for local school boards and local units of government. Some work for the executive branch of government. Some work for other members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' said the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> raised the specter of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> examining spouses' work, and the concern among members was evident. `` I think that saying any money to a spouse is a gift, as a woman that offends me. Most spouses I know that work, work,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, D-Colo. `` I do think that spouses' income is something that we need a very clear guideline But I am offended that anybody would make the supposition that any income to a spouse is a gift.'' <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Regula </PERSON>, wife of Rep. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Regula </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ohio </LOCATION>, and president of the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> made up of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> spouses, wondered whether it was possible to set definite rules. `` How could you limit the life of another person's career?'' <PERSON> Regula </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from her home in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. `` How could you even put together a bill without getting into constitutional rights?'' The <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> has not conducted an official survey on whether member spouses work, but <PERSON> Regula </PERSON> estimates about 70 percent are employed either part-time or full-time. Careers cover a wide range of fields and <PERSON> Regula </PERSON> wondered why the emphasis was on wives rather than husbands. `` <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>'s husband practices law. He has a lucrative practice.

The teen-agers both died in violence in the occupied territories stemming from funerals for victims of earlier clashes. The girl was killed in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, the boy in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>.

The army confirmed the death of the man without giving its cause, and a spokesmen said they were checking the other reports. <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports also said six Palestinians were wounded during today's clashes. The victims included a 9-year-old boy shot in the leg at the Faraa refugee camp in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, the reports said. With today's deaths, 438 Palestinians have been killed in the 16-month Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories. Eighteen Israelis also have died. Today's killing in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> occurred at the Dheishe refugee camp outside <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, where several hundred angry youths, some carrying outlawed <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> flags, burned tires and stoned Israeli cars at the end of a burial ceremony.

<TEXT>
 A federal judge today separated <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> from a $ 100 million racketeering case because of ill health, leaving his wife to stand trial without him. Prosecutors reversed themselves earlier this month and conceded the 71-year-old deposed <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> president was too sick to stand trial for the forseeable future. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> has been hospitalized since Jan. 15 in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, where he has lived in exile since his ouster in 1986. He suffers from heart, kidney and lung problems. Prosecutors withdrew their objection to separating <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> from the case April 6 after a government doctor examined him for the second time. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> signed an order placing the case against <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> in limbo. <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> did not dismiss the charges. The judge noted that the government could resume its case against <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> if his health improved. Most people close to the case say a recovery is unlikely. No trial date has been set for his wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>. The Marcoses, eight others and the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Overseas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> are accused of siphoning more than $ 100 million from the Philippine treasury and funneling it into this country for the purchase of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> real estate and art.

<HEAD>Report Alleges Ethics Violations by Wright</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Inserts 3 grafs new Wright quotes after 2nd graf pvs, The committee</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee charged today that <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> violated official rules of conduct 69 times by not disclosing thousands of dollars in alleged gifts and by skirting rules on speaking fees through bulk book sales. The committee _ six Democrats and six Republicans _ unanimously approved the statement of alleged violations, announced the chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Calif. Less than two hours later, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> defended himself in a speech to a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> labor meeting and asked for a speedy end to the matter `` I know in my heart I have not violated any of the rules of that institution,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. `` I have today requested very urgently that ... I be given the privilege of coming this afternoon, today, right now or tomorrow or the next day, surely within a week to confront them, to confront the allegations head-on, face-to-face.'' The charges, divided into five counts, and an accompanying report by <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>, the attorney who conducted the committee's investigation, could jeopardize <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s future as speaker. The statement `` represents a determination by the committee that in 69 instances, there is reason to believe that Rep. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> violated the code of official conduct and other <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules which apply to him as a member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said. He emphasized that the committee's action is similar to an indictment _ based on a comparatively low standard of proof _ and not a conviction. `` The speaker of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> has not been found guilty of any violations but from a review of the evidence the committee has found a reason to believe'' violations may have occurred, <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said. `` We have not reached any final conclusions on the matters that are still under investigation,'' he said, telling reporters that, for further proceedings, the standard will be `` clear and convincing evidence.'' The committee, under its rules, will next allow <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> to respond within 21 days. After that, the committee has 30 days to decide whether to hold a `` disciplinary hearing'' on whether <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> indeed violated rules and what punishment, if any, it should recommend to the full House. The panel cleared <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> of several accusations filed against him last year when the inquiry began, including alleged use of a staff member to write the book, improper use of campaign funds and improper lobbying on behalf of constituents. The most controversial lobbying effort by <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was the pressure he put on federal regulators to go easy on <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> thrift institutions that were failing due to a weak economy. Although the speaker `` may have been intemperate'' in his efforts, the committee was not persuaded, <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said. In all, <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> found 116 alleged violations, and the committee dismissed 47 of those. The committee will continue its investigation into an allegation surrounding the investent in an oil and gas well by <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>. The committee has issued subpoenas in that case, he said. `` I am prepared to appear as early as Monday afternoon, but certainly the committee should be able to schedule a hearing within seven days,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said in a letter sent to the committee Sunday night. `` I continue to believe that I have not violated any House rules, and I am absolutely certain that I have never knowingly or intentionally done so,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said in the letter. But <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> told a news confrence the committee had just received the letter and did not know when <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> would appear. As for the 69 charges, the committee determined that apparent gifts from <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s business partner, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>, appeared to be improper because the <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, developer had a direct interest in legislation'' and had not been properly reported to the House. `` The nature and extent of the apparent gifts from Mr. <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> indicates that Rep. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> did not exercise reasonable care to avoid even the appearance of impropriety, which is the hallmark of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> gift rule,'' <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said. The committee said the $ 145,000 in gifts included free or cut-rate use of a condominium in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, an $ 18,000-a-year salary paid <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON>, and free use of a car. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said the committee also charged that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> skirted <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> limits on speaking fees through the sales of his book, `` Reflections of a Public Man.'' `` In the committee's view, seven bulk sales of the Rep. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s book ... demonstrated an overall scheme to evade the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> outside earned income limit because -LRB- speaking -RRB- honorarium payments were recharacterized as royalties. The House will ultimately be <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s jury, and <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> last week launched an effort to blunt the impact of the charges and keep his majority Democrats in line. Following news reports that the committee had concluded it had `` reason to believe'' that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> violated <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules in dozens of instances, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> on Thursday gathered his top lieutenants for a half-hour-long statement in the Capitol. The speaker gave his version of the main charges against him, and with quivering voice vowed to fight for his reputation and that of his wife. He appealed to other <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members with working spouses by strongly stating that Mrs. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> earned the salary she was paid by <PERSON> Mallightco </PERSON>, the partnership the <ORGANIZATION> Wrights </ORGANIZATION> had with <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> and his wife. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s second in command, Majority Leader <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., went on television Sunday and urged people not to judge too quickly Asked if <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> would be crippled politically even if he beat the charges, <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said: `` No, I do n't believe that and I think we have to be terribly careful that we do n't let accusation bring about its own taint of guilt.'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> appeared on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Week With <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>'' opposite Rep. <PERSON> Vin </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>, R-Minn., a close ally and adviser to the man who first brought the charges against <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, R-Ga. <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>, while saying that judgment should be withheld, said he believed the charges against <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> were `` much more substantive'' than just `` some technical violations that any member might have inadvertently committed The investigation of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was triggered by a complaint filed with the ethics committee last May by <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, a persistent critic of Democratic leadership in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> in particular who is now the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> minority whip. Although Common Cause, a good government group, was in his corner, <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>'s maneuver at first was seen mostly as a political tactic. Many expected it would quickly be brushed away by the panel, perhaps even before last July's Democratic National Convention. However, the committee undertook a sweeping investigation led by <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> attorney it hired for the case. A Democrat, <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> dispelled <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> suspicions that he would go easy on the speaker. His probe, which lasted through the winter and cost an estimated $ 1.5 million, presented the committee with a voluminous report on the speaker's dealings. Even if the committee votes against sanctioning the speaker, <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> leaders have promised to keep <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> a political issue. House Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., has said he would use House rules to force a vote on the committee report Republicans would try to use that to portray themselves as anti-corruption and anyone who votes against them as corrupt.

 Does `` The Big Chill'' leave you cold? Tired of hearing `` oldies'' older than you on TV commercials? Three exasperated young upstarts say, `` Right on!'' The reminder that the calendar says 1989 comes from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Time _ three guys in their 20s who say `` We want to end the'60s in your lifetime.'' `` Let's make nostalgia a thing of the past!'' say these fellows who've had enough of the baby boom _ that huge post-World War II generation whose sheer bulk spurred creation of the retail market for teen-agers, divided the nation over <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and now is taking up space discovering adulthood _ marriage, careers and babies destined to grow up hearing stories about <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION>. Anti-nostalgia crusader <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Dillenburg </PERSON> dismisses baby boomers as `` 50 million teenagers who never grew up.'' But they wo n't go away. `` There's so many of them. If they want to live in their past, that's fine _ but they're forcing ME to live in their past,'' gripes <PERSON> Dillenburg </PERSON>, 29, of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. He founded NAFTAT with friends <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Keeney </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Here's a sampling from <LOCATION> Dillenburg </LOCATION>'s long list of complaints: Movies _ `` The Big Chill.'' Theater _ the revival of `` Hair.'' Television _ `` The Wonder Years.'' Print Media _ <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>'s nationally syndicated <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> column. Books _ volumes on the riotous 1968 Democratic National Convention in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, `` as insignificant an event as ever happened in this country.'' <ORGANIZATION> NAFTAT </ORGANIZATION> is part of a natural anti-boomer backlash, according to <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> sociologist <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Beck </PERSON>, who says any cultural statement that lasts too long `` seems to generate resentment.'' By failing to step aside `` the way it's supposed to,'' the baby-boom generation has `` thrown out of kilter the ordinary succession of generations,'' <PERSON> Beck </PERSON> said. `` There always has been disdain toward this generation because there's so many of us in it,'' observed <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>, singled out by <PERSON> Dillenburg </PERSON> as a sort of arch-boomer. <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> defends nostalgia, saying readers of all ages respond to his columns about the past. But when <PERSON> Dillenburg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> got together in 1987 and discovered their mutual exasperation with `` oldies'' radio, they decided it was time to get the <ORGANIZATION> Monkees </ORGANIZATION> off their backs. Preserve what is worth remembering from the'60s _ the Beatles, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON> and the civil rights movement, for example _ and scrap the rest, <PERSON> Dillenburg </PERSON> suggests. NAFTAT cranks out leaflets calling on sympathizers to `` fight for the present and annoy a lot of self-important ex-hippies in the process.'' Today's young people may not go in for demonstrations, but they care about apartheid and other issues, he said. <ORGANIZATION> NAFTAT </ORGANIZATION>'s feelings about the baby boomers are not altogether different from the reaction the post-war generation got from their `` silent majority'' elders 20 years ago, <PERSON> Beck </PERSON> said. Many parents waited through the Depression and World War II to have children, and their offspring `` grew up being told by everyone around them _ and believing _ that they were the most important thing in the world,'' he said. `` They are endlessly fascinated with their own lives,'' he said, and their vast numbers make every setback `` central cultural business.'' The message baby-boomers send to others, <PERSON> Dillenburg </PERSON> said, is: `` You missed the'60s _ your life is meaningless. Your life is irrelevant because it came after mine.''

 A radio bomb confiscated from suspected <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> terrorists exploded at federal police headquarters today as experts tried to defuse it, killing one officer and critically injuring another.

The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> initially reported two officers were critically injured in today's explosion. Bundeskriminalamt spokesman <PERSON> Arno </PERSON> <PERSON> Falk </PERSON> said later that one of policemen had died. <PERSON> Brunhilde </PERSON> <PERSON> Spies-Mohr </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the federal police bureau or Bundeskriminalamt, said in <LOCATION> Wiesbaden </LOCATION>: `` During investigation of a suspicious device suspected of containing explosives, a detonation occurred. `` The material that exploded was a device obtained during investigation of Palestinian terrorists.'' The explosives were hidden in a radio receiver, she added. The blast occurred in a basement room of the federal police headquarters, Ms. <PERSON> Spies-Mohr </PERSON> said. Part of the Bundeskriminalamt building was evacuated after the explosion while bomb disposal experts disarmed a second device, she said. An identical radio-bomb containing plastic explosives and an air pressure-sensitive detonator was seized during an Oct. 26 raid on an apartment used by suspected Paletinian terrorists in the city of <LOCATION> Neuss </LOCATION>. It was not immediately clear where the bomb that exploded in the federal police headquarters came from. One unofficial source who did not want to be identified said it was the same bomb confiscated in the <LOCATION> Neuss </LOCATION> raid. But that device has been handled repeatedly by West German and foreign investigators in their probe of the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> crash, and was presumed disarmed long ago.

 <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> still gives the impression that he could be spending his days repairing electric carts at the <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipyard </ORGANIZATION>. Instead, he is usually to be found negotiating with the interior minister, meeting with foreign heads of state and leading the Solidarity movement that has changed his country's course. The story of <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> scaling the shipyard fence to inspire strikers in forming the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc's first independent trade union is often repeated, but should not lose its significance: <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> has not been the same since that day in August 1980. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, 45, has never lost the authenticity with which he drew millions to his vision of workers' solidarity. On Monday, he chalked up his latest victory, leading Solidarity through seven years of repressions to regain its legal status, just as he vowed to do. The winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, a man of deep Roman Catholic faith, intended to travel to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> on Wednesday to thank Polish-born Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> II for the church's role in helping to bring about the agreement with authorities. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> wears a suit and tie these days, but always with a picture of the <PERSON> Black </PERSON> <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Czestochowa </LOCATION> icon and a Solidarity pin on his lapel. He usually also sports a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vice-presidential tie pin given him by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in 1987. But he remains a modest person, often answering his home telephone himself and riding the early morning train from <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> on his frequent trips to <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> for high-level meetings with Polish authorities. When in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, he stays in a small cloister cell at the church episcopate. After a long night of negotiations, he sometimes travels the four hours back to <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> to sleep in his own bed. Complaining of a bad cold, he decided to stay in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> on Monday when a court in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> formally registered Solidarity again as a legal trade union independent of the government. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s autocratic leadership style bothers some in the union. And although he is a spell-binding orator, his statements to reporters can sometimes be as cryptic as an oracle's pronouncements. A natural politician who goes with his gut, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> ignored warnings that he was giving in too easily in September when he put his reputation with workers on the line by ending a series of strikes nationwide in return for a vague promise of talks from the government. Although some youthful militants chanted `` Down with <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>!'' in the months that followed, he never seemed to doubt the decision. Many Solidarity activists point to <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s convincing showing in a nationwide TV debate in October as the turning point that brought about the talks which won Solidarity its legalization. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> apologized for his poor performance. Much has changed in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> during the eight months since the August strikes, but not <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>. He marked his conclusion of an historic accord with the government on April 5 not at the celebratory cocktail party at a government palace, but by eating dinner in a nearly deserted hotel dining room with an aide. `` I am exhausted and I do n't like eating standing,'' he said.

<HEAD>Poll: Abortion Ban Won't Stop Abortion</HEAD>

 Though a sizable minority of adults oppose abortions, Americans overwhelmingly believe that banning them would do little to curtail them, a <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General-Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> survey has found. With the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> poised to reconsider the issue next week, the national poll found support for legal abortion ranging from 50 percent to 65 percent of the 1,108 adults polled, depending on the question posed. Fifty-three percent, for example, were in favor of the court's 1973 ruling legalizing abortion in the first three months of pregnancy And if the court reversed itself and let each state make its own abortion law, 57 percent would want abortion legal in their state. Moreover, large majorities said outlawing abortion would fail to prevent it from occurring _ an argument used by those who argue many women would have unsafe illegal abortions if the operation were banned. The poll asked: `` If abortion were illegal in your state, do you think that would stop most women there who want abortions from having them, or would most of them go to another state where it was legal?'' Eighty-seven percent said the women would go to another state. The survey next asked if making abortions illegal nationwide would stop most women from having them, or if those women would have illegal abortions or go to a country where abortion is legal. Seventy-three percent said most women would find a way to have abortions. The survey nonetheless found its closest split on the question of a constitutional amendment to make abortions illegal except in cases of rape, incest or to save the life of the mother: Fifty percent were opposed and 44 percent in favor, a division within the poll's margin of error. No amendment with those provisions is before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, but they are the terms President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he would support. Because the wording of questions on such a sensitive issue can affect the results, the poll posed the matter in a variety of ways. The findings on basic attitudes toward abortion were similar in other recent surveys. One question asked: `` Should abortion be legal as it is now; legal only in such cases as rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother; or should it not be permitted at all?'' Fifty percent said legal as now, 39 percent said legal in some cases, 7 percent wanted it banned and the rest were unsure. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> have asked the same poll question since 1985, tracking a slight increase in support for current law. Depending on the questions, though, other polls have found slight declines in support for legal abortion, and others still have found no change. In another question, outside the legal context, the poll asked: `` If a woman wants to have an abortion and her doctor agrees to it, should she be allowed to have an abortion, or not?'' Sixty-five percent said yes, 25 percent said no and the remaining 10 percent had no opinion. The CBS-Times poll has found a similar response to that same question. Opposition to abortion was greatest among older, less wealthy and less educated respondents, and Republicans and conservatives. There was no significant division in opinion between men and women. The federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> say 1.3 million abortions are performed annually in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, making it one of the nation's most common surgical procedures. Next week, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is to hear a case that could enable it to review its 1973 ruling legalizing abortion, with a decision expected later in the year. On related issues, the Media General-AP survey found: _ Widespread opposition to protests by <ORGANIZATION> Operation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION>, the anti-abortion group whose members have been blocking entrances to abortion clinics around the country. Sixty-seven percent opposed those demonstrations, 22 percent supported them and 11 percent were unsure. _ Narrow opposition to the use of federal funds to help poor women with their medical bills if they want an abortion. Forty-nine percent opposed such spending, 41 percent were in favor. The rest did not answer. _ Fifty-one percent support for legalization in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of RU486, a drug developed in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> that stops very early pregnancy by preventing the fertilized egg from being implanted in the uterine wall. Anti-abortion groups call the drug an abortion pill and threaten boycotts against any drug company that produces it. Supporters call it simpler and safer than surgical abortion. In the poll, 51 percent said it should be legal here, 24 percent said not and 25 percent were unsure. The poll was conducted March 6-15. <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a communications company based in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, publishes the Richmond Times-Dispatch, the Richmond News Leader, the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> -RRB- Journal, and operates TV stations <ORGANIZATION> WXFL </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, WCBD in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> WJKS </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>.

 This <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General-Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> poll is based on telephone interviews March 6 to 15 with 1,108 adults in the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Phone numbers were selected randomly and interviews were conducted with the adult who had the most recent birthday. The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the sample. The poll has a 3-point margin of error, meaning that if every adult American were asked the same questions, the results theoretically would be the within 3 points of the poll's results, 19 times out of 20. The error margin is larger for subgroups. There are other sources of potential error in polls, including the wording and order of questions. These are the questions and responses in this poll; because of rounding, sums may not total 100: 1. If a woman wants to have an abortion and her doctor agrees to it, should she be allowed to have an abortion, or not? Yes: 65 percent. No: 25 percent. Do n't know or no answer: 10 percent. 2. Should abortion be legal as it is now; legal only in such cases as rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother; or should it not be permitted at all? As now: 50. In cases: 39. Not at all: 7. DK-NA: 4. 3. Would you favor or oppose a constitutional amendment that would make abortions illegal except in cases of rape, incest or to save the life of the mother? Favor: 44. Oppose: 50. DK-NA: 5. 4. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled in 1973 that states can not prevent a woman from having an abortion if she wants one at any time during the first three months of pregnancy. Do you favor or oppose that ruling? Favor: 53. Oppose: 41. DK-NA: 6. 5. If the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> reversed its 1973 ruling and let each state make its own abortion laws, abortion could become legal in some states and illegal in others. Would you want abortion to be legal or illegal in your state? Legal: 57. Illegal: 37. DK-NA: 7. 6. If abortion was illegal in your state, do you think that would stop most women there who want abortions from having them, or would most of them go to another state where it was legal? Stop: 7. Go: 87. DK-NA: 6. 7. If abortion was illegal in every state, do you think that would stop most women who want abortions from having them, or would most of them have illegal abortions or go to another country for abortions? Stop: 20. Go: 73. DK-NA: 7. 8. A group that opposes abortion has been holding demonstrations where its members block the entrances to abortion clinics until the police arrest them and carry them off. How do you feel about these demonstrations _ support them strongly, support them, oppose them, or oppose them strongly? Support strongly: 4. Support: 18. Oppose: 37. Oppose strongly: 30. DK-NA: 11. 9. A pill is now available in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> that stops pregnancy by preventing the fertilized egg from becoming implanted in the uterine wall. Do you think this drug should be legal in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, or not? Yes: 51. No: 24. DK-NA: 25. 10.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Actions at a Glance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Here, at a glance, is a rundown of Monday's major actions by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> DRUG SEARCH WARRANT The court, in a case involving a notorious Mexican drug-smuggling operation, agreed to decide whether <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law enforcement agents need a warrant before searching on foreign soil someone who is not an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizen. The court said it will hear <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration arguments that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agents did not violate the Constitution when, without a warrant, they searched the home of a suspected Mexican drug smuggler. <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Verdugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Urquidez </PERSON> was convicted in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> last year of taking part in the 1985 kidnapping, torture and murder of Drug Enforcement Administration Agent <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> and his pilot, <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Zavala </PERSON> <PERSON> Avelar </PERSON>. <PERSON> Verdugo </PERSON>'s conviction and sentence in the murders is not at issue in the case the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> acted on Monday. His appeal centered on a separate drug-smuggling conviction. The case is <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vs. Verdugo-Urquidez, 88-1353. NATIONAL GUARD - GOVERNORS The court refused to bar the federal government from requiring certain peacetime training for any state's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> troops without first getting the governor's consent. The justices, without comment, left intact a 1986 federal law prohibiting governors from withholding permission for such training missions. The law had been challenged by <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> officials. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 passed the so-called Montgomery Amendment after several governors voiced opposition to the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's Central American policy and said they would withhold their consent to <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> training missions in that region The case is <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>, 88-1223. EVANGELISTS - TAXES The court agreed to decide whether states may tax television evangelists' sales of religious books, tapes and other merchandise. The justices said they will review rulings that forced the Louisiana-based <ORGANIZATION> Jimmy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swaggart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION> to pay <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> $ 183,000 in back taxes and interest for the years 1974 through 1981. Lawyers for <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s organization argue that the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> tax, as applied, violates religious freedom. The case is <ORGANIZATION> Jimmy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swaggart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> vs. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equalization </ORGANIZATION>, 88-1374. MURDER CONFESSION The court agreed to consider reinstating the murder conviction of a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> man who confessed to killing his former girlfriend after police illegally arrested him at his home. The court said it will review a ruling that threw out <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' conviction because his confession was used as evidence against him. The ruling is being appealed by <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> prosecutors. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> last October ruled that <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> is entitled to a new trial on charges stemming from the stabbing death of <PERSON> Thelma </PERSON> <PERSON> Staton </PERSON>. The case is <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> vs. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, 88-1000. PAUPER APPEAL For only the second time in its history, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> permanently barred someone from appealing to it as a pauper after ruling that he failed to prove he can not afford the filing fees. The justices, by a 6-3 vote, ruled that <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Wrenn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Drum </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, may never again submit a so-called pauper's petition _ unless he can show his financial circumstances have changed significantly for the worse. Unless granted pauper status, anyone who appeals to the high court must pay $ 200 in filing fees plus significant printing costs. The court, in a four-page, unsigned opinion, noted that <PERSON> Wrenn </PERSON> has filed 22 appeals to the court since 1986 and the court has denied him pauper's status 19 times. One one occasion, <PERSON> Wrenn </PERSON> paid the $ 200 fee. The cases are <PERSON> Wrenn </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>, 88-6494, and <PERSON> Wrenn </PERSON> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, 88-6497.

 A gatekeeper said today he refused police orders to open an outer gate and allow thousands of late arrivals to pour into a soccer stadium where 94 fans were crushed to death. Fans and officials said police opened the barrier. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yorkshire </LOCATION> police, who were in charge of Saturday's club semifinal at <LOCATION> Hillsborough </LOCATION> stadium, came under mounting attack as <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> ordered a week of mourning for victims who came to watch the city's team play play <ORGANIZATION> Nottingham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. Fans and officials said officers responded inadequately and far too slowly when spectators were crushed against a steel anti-riot fence in a standing-room-only area. <PERSON> Gatekeeper </PERSON> <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Yorkshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> he refused police orders to open a 16-foot-wide outer gate. Survivors said about 4,000 fans outside were pushing at turnstiles. Stone would not confirm survivors' reports that police officers opened the concertina gate. But he told the newspaper: `` You know as well as anyone whose fault it was.'' <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> fan <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitton </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> television: `` The steward put his hand on the gate and said, ` Do n't open it. The police said, ` Open the gate. There's going to be a crush.' Then two police officers opened the gate.'' New arrivals poured in, pressing those inside against the 10-foot fence. Mounted police herded them into the overcrowded center terrace, some fans said today. The crush was so great, <PERSON> Mitton </PERSON> said, that fans fell on the floor and people climbed over them. `` All the police were doing was standing up saying ` get back, get back.' There was already people dead then. I climbed on them to get over the fence.'' <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yorkshire </LOCATION>'s Chief Constable <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said Saturday a senior officer decided to open the gates `` to save people's lives and to relieve the crush outside.'' He said he was not aware of any connection between the gate being opened and the surge on the standing section, where many victims died. One of those being trapped in the front of the terrace, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendry </PERSON>, 19, said: `` People were screaming at the police to open the gate -LRB- at the front of the terrace -RRB- and three fans managed to climb over the fence, but no sooner had they got out than one of them was thrown back over by a copper.'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Middup </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> representative, said today the growing public criticism of police actions was `` grossly unfair.'' `` They were faced with a situation for which no amount of training could prepare them,'' he said. In Parliament today, Home Secretary <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> announced an independent inquiry to determine the cause of what Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> called `` a disaster of immense proportions.'' <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said major soccer clubs may be told to replace standing-room terraces with seats _ as lawmakers and sports officials are demanding. `` We owe a duty to these passionate supporters of football -LRB- soccer -RRB- to examine urgently and thoroughly the causes and background and to do all in our power to prevent such a thing happening again,'' <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said. `` We have to set our sights high and find a better way for British football.'' Lord Justice <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> will lead the inquiry starting Tuesday, he said. Police released the names of all 94 victims today, ranging from a 10-year-old boy who was trampled and the 67-year-old brother of a former <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> soccer player to two sisters who died before their father's eyes. Businessman <PERSON> Trevor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON>, 43, tried to resuscitate his two daughters, <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON>, 19, and <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION>, 15, after they were pulled from the crush of bodies. `` Football was the one thing we did as a family and now we are not a family anymore,'' he said. All the victims were British. Thirty-four were teen-agers and 33 were in their 20s. Seven were women. Of the 170 injured, 47 remained hospitalized today, including 17 in intensive care. <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> soccer team members visited some of the injured fans, as did <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> and his wife, Princess <PERSON> Diana </PERSON>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yorkshire </LOCATION> police, whose crowd-control measures will be at the core of the inquiry, handed over the police investigation to neighboring <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Midlands </LOCATION> police. Authorities will want to determine why thousands of fans still were outside as the match began and examine charges that many entered the sold-out stadium, which has a capacity of 54,000, with forged tickets or no tickets at all. Sir <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Livermore </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> lawyer and former Lord Mayor of <LOCATION> Liverpool </LOCATION>, released a statement from a policeman whom he refused to identify calling the police operation disorganized, `` pathetic'' and `` amateurish.'' The <LOCATION> Liverpool </LOCATION> city council today called an official week of mourning and discussed ways of helping the bereaved and injured. It was the third major soccer tragedy in four years involving English teams, which have been barred from <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> soccer competition since a May 29, 1985, rampage by <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> fans at <LOCATION> Heysel </LOCATION> stadium in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> that killed 39 people. <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s soccer authority last week lifted the ban on English clubs playing in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in the 1990-91 season, pending a review next April.

 A helicopter plucked a drug kingpin from a prison yard today but crashed as it took off, seriously injuring the inmate and pilot, officials said. The helicopter went down about 10 a.m. after a propeller caught concertina wire atop the wall at the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center, authorities said. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> `` Barry'' <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>, a champion powerboat racer serving a life sentence, and the pilot, whose identity was n't immediately known, were taken to <ORGANIZATION> Jackson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> after the escape attempt, said <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Marshal <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Horgan </PERSON>. `` Prison guards immediately extracted <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> and the pilot out of the wreckage and administered first aid. They were hurt quite seriously,'' <PERSON> Horgan </PERSON> said. `` Ironically, they were taken by helicopter to the hospital,''' <PERSON> Horgan </PERSON> said. Initial reports indicated the pilot suffered head, neck and back injuries and <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>, 34, fractured his left ankle, authorities said. <ORGANIZATION> MCC </ORGANIZATION> is the major prison for drug traffickers and others arrested for federal crimes in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Among some 1,000 inmates are <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> policemen convicted of running a drug ripoff ring and others convicted of large-scale cocaine and marijuana trafficking or awaiting trial. Warden <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said that the helicopter reportedly hovered just above the recreation yard and that <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> grabbed onto a ski and was either climbing into the craft or was aboard when it crashed. Some witnesses said a second inmate may have tried to climb aboard, he said. `` It appears he was ready,'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. `` According to witnesses, he ran to the helicopter and jumped on as soon as it swooped down.'' The pilot was holding an identification for <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Sterns </PERSON>, but the warden said authorities suspect the ID may have been for <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> was convicted in October in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> federal court of running a continuing criminal enterprise and was sentenced to life without parole under the `` drug kingpin'' law, <PERSON> Horgan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> was brought here in December in connection with federal charges in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> for distribution of marijuana. <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> was exercising in a portion of the prison for escape risks, including anyone serving a life term, authorities said. The wrecked helicopter was a two-seat, Bell-model bubble type, authorities said.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today announced new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic help for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, praising the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> government's move toward reform and saying `` we can and must answer this call to freedom.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> traveled to the Polish-American city of <LOCATION> Hamtramck </LOCATION>, which is surrounded by <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, to extoll the communist government's agreement to reinstate the Solidarity trade union movement and to hold the first free elections in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> since before World War II While the president announced a series of steps aimed at helping <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> restore its battered economy, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said continued aid would depend on consistent moves by the communist government toward reform. `` We will not act unconditionally,'' he said. `` We will not offer aid without requiring sound economic practices in return. We must remember that <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> is still a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION>. We must take no steps that compromise the security of the West.'' The concessions could open the way for a flow to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> of up to $ 1 billion in new loans, loan rescheduling and trade and investment relief, according to administration and international monetary sources. Later, in a <LOCATION> Polish </LOCATION> restaurant in <LOCATION> Hamtramck </LOCATION> where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had lunch, he was asked by reporters whether his package was intended to send a message to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` It's a good, strong meessage and I hope it was heard there and in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Administration officials, who declined to be identified, also said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> may travel to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in July, immediately before or after the seven-nation economic summit in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. The trip would underscore <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>'s landmark April 5 steps restoring the legal status of the union Solidarity and scheduling the first open elections in the communist-run country since before World War II. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke to a crowd of several hundred people outside the <LOCATION> Hamtramck </LOCATION> city hall. He received rousing applause when he said that `` today, this very day, the free trade union Solidarity was formally restored.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the new agreements by the Polish government with the Solidarity movement that it banned in 1981 should help <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> arrange new loans from multinational lending organizations such as the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>. The sources said in advance of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s speech that could amount to rescheduling up to $ 700 million in existing loans in an effort to help <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> make a dent in its $ 39 billion international debt. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s package also called for a lowering of tariffs on selected Polish imports through the Generalized System of Preferences, a move that requires congressional approval. This system of preferential tariffs traditionally is used by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government to assist less-developed nations. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also announced that he will seek congressional approval for a program of U.S.-guaranteed loans, through the <ORGANIZATION> Overseas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, to stimulate private investment in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. He also said he would propose negotiations that could lead to joint ventures between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Polish businesses. Sources said that some of the proposed inducements would be linked to future steps by <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> to liberalize its markets and make changes in its long-troubled economy. `` If <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s experiment succeeds, other countries may follow,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` While we must still differentiate among the nations of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> offers two lessons for all.'' `` First, there can be no progress without significant political and economic liberalization,'' he said. `` Second, help from the West will come in concert with liberalization. Our friends and <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> allies share this philosophy.'' `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has never accepted the legitimacy of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s division,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` We accept no spheres of influence that deny the sovereign rights of nations.'' Yet, the president said, `` the winds of change are shaping a new Europen destiny.'' `` The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the Polish-American community, the American labor movement, our allies and international financial institutions, must work in concert if Polish democracy is to take root anew and sustain itself,'' he said. `` We can and must answer this call to freedom.''

 <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Popadiuk </PERSON>, a presidential spokesman, said he was aware of the $ 1 billion figure that other administration officials had put on the package, but that the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would refrain from assigning a pricetag because there were too many variables. The full impact of the aid package could only be realized if other creditor governments went along with the proposed loan rescheduling. <PERSON> Popadiuk </PERSON> said of the $ 39 billion in outstanding Polish debt, only $ 2.4 billion is owed to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. He said congressional approval of the plan to give <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> tariff relief could provide benefits ranging from $ 3.5 million to $ 25 million, depending on what products are selected and on how aggressively <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> makes use of the new opportunity to export more goods to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. This nation imported $ 417 million in merchandise from <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> last year, including textiles, steel, fish and ham; and exported to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> $ 304 million in goods, much of it in grain. A fact sheet distributed by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> said that the administration would work closely with Solidarity in deciding which additional credits to grant the Polish government. The April 5 agreement called for free elections in June, and for creation of a two-house parliament. The newly created 100-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would be the Eastern bloc's first freely elected legislative chamber The government also promised to make 35 percent of the seats of the existing 460-member Sejm elective. An elective post of president would become available in six years. The government also conferred full legal status on the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s package further eases <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions imposed against <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in 1981 and 1982 following declaration of martial law and the outlawing of Solidarity. Some of the original sanctions were lifted in 1987 after the Polish government moved toward reconciliation with the union. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials reacted positively to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s steps to grant its citizens mor freedom. White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> called the Polish movement toward new liberties `` a historic step'' and `` a great day for the Polish people.'' Still, administration officials have voiced caution. `` <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> has taken a step away from totalitarianism, although democracy is far from having been achieved,'' Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said Friday. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> as vice president in September 1987 during a nine-nation European tour.

<TEXT>
 Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> is trying to uproot decades of populist political tradition and restructure <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s tax system in a test that may be a barometer of his political future Opposing him are anti-tax lawmakers, including former <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, and a tradition of making business pay the bulk of the bills. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> says the state must lighten the tax burden on business to create new jobs and get away from dependence on the petroleum industry. An April 29 referendum is scheduled on a proposed constitutional amendment authorizing the Legislature to make basic changes in the tax structure. A new tax code approved by legislators during a special session in late February and early March will take effect if the amendment is approved. The <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> convened Monday for its 85-day regular session, but no major action is expected until after the election, when lawmakers will have an idea of how much money will be available. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> wants a combination of personal income tax increases, sales tax decreases and business tax breaks, along with a $ 1.5 billion improvement program for highways, airports and ports to be funded by a net increase in gasoline taxes of about 1 cent per gallon. Taxes on cigarettes and wine would go up. The plan also includes a new balanced-budget measure in the state constitution and a trust fund that would set aside mineral revenue should oil prices boom again. The proposed changes chop at the roots of a populist tax system that began evolving during the 1930s. Now, homesteads valued at $ 75,000 are exempt from parish property taxes, businesses pay 95 percent of property taxes and annual auto license plate fees are $ 3. Petroleum companies have historically footed much of the bill for state programs through severance taxes and leases on state land. In the early 1980s, oil and gas revenue amounted to more than 40 percent of the total state budget and the good times rolled in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. But when prices fell and production was curtailed, the state was thrown into one budget crisis after another. The state now gets only 20 percent of its revenue from petroleum. Opponents claim <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>'s plan constitutes a $ 621 million tax increase that will guarantee nothing for the state's economy, plagued by the nation's highest unemployment rate at more than 11 percent. A recent statewide poll by <ORGANIZATION> Mason-Dixon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> indicated that voters were about evenly split among support, opposition and indecision. The total state budget is about $ 7.7 billion. If the tax revision plan passes, <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> says $ 234 million in reductions will be needed to balance the budget. Without the plan, an additional $ 485 million will have to be cut from the budget. The governor says he's too busy trying to rally public support for his tax plan to worry about possible political implications. `` I'm not in this to be safe, to sit at home and say, ` Well, you know I could n't try it because it's too risky,''' <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> said. But Rep. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, a supporter of the tax plan, said the package is `` clearly a Buddy <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> tax package and, in a way, it becomes a referendum on the governor.'' On the other side is <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, elected in February on an anti-tax plank. `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> -RRB- has said it will not hurt citizens on the lower end of the income scale, but the increases will actually begin at $ 25,000,'' said <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>. The governor counters that state income tax figures for 1987 showed that more than 70 percent of those filing returns made less than $ 25,000. The <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, a government watchdog group, said the first-year increase in state taxes would total $ 116 million. Personal taxes would increase in 1989-90 by $ 171 million and business taxes would decline by $ 55 million. By 1992-93, businesses would enjoy a $ 219 million decrease from current tax levels, <ORGANIZATION> PARC </ORGANIZATION> said. Personal taxes would rise to $ 218 million by 1992-93, leaving total state tax revenues at virtually the same level as under the current structure, <ORGANIZATION> PARC </ORGANIZATION> said.

 Lottery officials waited today for the holders of four tickets to step forward and claim a world-record jackpot of $ 69.9 million. Holders of the tickets, whether it's one person, a couple or a group, will split the pot, which was raised from $ 69 million today after final sales were tallied. Two people, one in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and one elsewhere in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, contacted state officials Sunday to report they held winning tickets, but Lottery Director <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> said the tickets would have to be validated before the millionaires could be annointed. Officials today tentatively identified one winner as a man from west central Illinois who planned to share the winnings with his two sisters from <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. He was on his way to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to have his ticket validated, said lottery spokeswoman <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Worley </PERSON>. `` For all of you who said it's easier to be struck by lightning than to win the Lotto, four people were struck last night and they struck gold,'' Ms. <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> said Sunday at a news conference. Each winner would get a $ 17.25 million share of the grand prize, paid over 20 years, said Lottery spokeswoman <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rem </PERSON>. The total could rise after final sales figures are tallied, she said. The winning numbers were 3, 14, 32, 40, 46 and 54. Hopeful players from around the country and world descended on <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> last week, buying record numbers of tickets that enabled lottery officials to boost the prize. Some rerouted flights, others called from as far away as <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to find out how to get a piece of the action. Losers said they were disappointed but took their losses in stride. `` I just got one ticket because ... if you're going to win, you'll win with one,'' said <PERSON> Lonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, a systems engineer from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. In addition to the four big winners, Ms. <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> said Saturday's drawing produced 1,220 players who matched five of the six numbers to win prizes of $ 2,316.50, and 73,452 who will receive $ 76.50 for matching four of six The jackpot beat the old world record of $ 61.98 million set in October in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. That pot was split among three winning tickets, one bought by an individual and the others bought by groups of co-workers. The previous Illinois record jackpot of $ 40 million was won by <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> printer <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Wittkowski </PERSON> in 1984. Ms. <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> said sales for the week _ $ 56.5 million _ eclipsed totals for the week leading up to the $ 40 million jackpot in 1984. She said sales on Saturday reached 27,000 tickets per minute. `` It was a little hairy there for a while,'' she said. Forty cents on every dollar in Lotto proceeds goes to the state for the Common School Fund, Ms. <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> said. But since the amount of money spent on schools is determined by state budget figures, the additional revenue from last week's record sales will go into state coffers not specifically slated for education, she said. If only one person had matched the numbers, the jackpot would have been the largest paid to a single winner. But with four ticketholders sharing the pot, the largest single winner in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history remains <PERSON> Sheelah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Winter </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, who walked away with $ 55.16 million in the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> lottery in September. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s Lotto jackpot is on the rise again, to an estimated $ 37 million in next Saturday's drawing, its second highest level after Ms. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>'s winnings, because nobody won this weekend's $ 23 million prize, <ORGANIZATION> Lottery </ORGANIZATION> secretary <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> announced Sunday. `` We're urging players to purchase their tickets early this week to avoid the possiblity of longer lines Friday and Saturday,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, who helped <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> set up its lottery before she moved south to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The inquest jury that exonerated British soldiers in the killing of three alleged Irish terrorists in <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> was acting on incomplete evidence and sometimes conflicting testimony, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> says. In a report published Tuesday that is likely to refuel the controversy over the killings on March 6, 1988, the human rights movement renewed its demand for a judicial inquiry, saying the inquest failed to allay suspicions of `` an official policy of deliberate planned killings of suspected members of armed opposition groups.'' It said the inquest was conducted properly, but believed that the verdict, although reached fairly, was based on `` evidence which from the outset was incomplete.'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s office said it had seen the report. `` As far as we are concerned the whole matter has been fully considered -LRB- by the inquest -RRB- and we see no grounds for opening up a fresh inquiry,'' said a spokesman, requesting anonymity. The government has faced persistent questions over the killing of <PERSON> Mairead </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> McCann </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> by a secrecy-shrouded military unit believed to have been flown in from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. The government said it acted on intelligence the three were armed and plotting to detonate a car bomb in the tourist-packed center of the British colony on the southern Spanish coast. The Irish <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> acknowledged the three were members sent to <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> `` on active service.'' But it quickly emerged the three were unarmed and that their car contained no bomb, and witnesses later said at least two of the suspects appeared to be trying to surrender to the plainclothes officers confronting them. The government said it feared they might have remote-control devices to detonate the explosives if they were given too much time to surrender. Angrily rejecting <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>'s call for an inquiry, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said an inquest would answer the questions. Seven months later, the inquest jury ruled 9-2 that the killings were lawful. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> sent three observers to the inquest, led by <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, a lawyer and ombudsman of the <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> province of <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. Its report comes two weeks after a British trial lawyer, <PERSON> Hilary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kitchin </PERSON>, who also observed the inquest, wrote that it fell short of international legal standards and raised questions about the legality of the killings. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>'s report said: `` Details about government policy, the planning of the operation, and the quality of the intelligence were not revealed.'' It said <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> police, who had been involved in tracking the three to the <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> border, did not testify. Spanish testimony could have helped establish whether they were known to be without guns or explosives. The absence of this testimony also made the evidence incomplete, the report said. It said much forensic evidence was destroyed `` because standard procedures were not followed,'' while the state pathologist was denied adequate post-mortem facilities and ballistics reports. `` Most of the key independent civilian eye witnesses were discovered by media journalists and not by the police,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>. `` The organization is also concerned that discrepancies between witnesses' testimonies had not been resolved and that many questions remained unanswered such as, for example, from what exact position the soldiers had fired, and whether the suspects had made attempts to surrender,'' the report said. Recalling past shootings in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> in which police were accused of killing when they could have made arrests, it said: `` The inquest has again failed to alleviate public concern that these suspects were killed rather than arrested.'' In an interview, <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> faced the challenge of `` keeping its composure in the face of sometimes intolerable violence.'' He said he was not accusing the British of stepping beyond the law. `` I'm saying doubt remains that has to be resolved ... and doubt is potentially very damaging to a representative democracy.'' The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to rid <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> of British rule and unite it with the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Group Says Drug Linked to Sudden Death Syndrome Shouldn't be Sold
without Prescription</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A drug commonly prescribed for sedation and relief of cold symptoms is linked to sudden infant death syndrome and should not be sold without a prescription, a public interest research group said Monday. <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> urged the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to reverse its decision allowing over-the-counter sales of the drug known by the trade name Phenergan. `` Over-the-counter availability implies <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> designation of a margin of safety which, in this case, is not justified,'' said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>, physicians with the health research group, in a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>. The group filed a petition with the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> four months ago to block over-the-counter sales of the drug, but no action has been taken. The group said the matter now deserves `` urgent attention'' because nonprescription doses of the drug are scheduled to reach pharmacy shelves in June. <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruzan </PERSON> said the group's petition is under review. The agency has 180 days to review such petitions, she said. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> last August decided that promethazine hydrochloride, the active ingredient in Phenergan, could be used in over-the-counter cough-cold products `` based on the fact there has n't been a safety problem to justify keeping it under prescription when used as labeled and it is labeled not for use in children under 6,'' <PERSON> Cruzan </PERSON> said. The drug is a phenothiazine, a class of major tranquilizers, with antihistamine properties that offer some relief from cold symptoms by drying the upper airways. It is manufactured by <ORGANIZATION> Wyeth-Ayerst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION>. Company spokeswoman <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashby </PERSON> said `` the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> carefully reviewed all data'' before making its decision and `` was satisfied the products are suitable for over-the-counter sales.'' She added that `` in their 35 years of marketing, these syrups have been remarkably problem-free.'' But the health group noted that although Phenergan is not recommended for children under 2 years old, doctors wrote 175,000 prescriptions for the drug for that age group in 1985. It is often prescribed for children with colic, <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> said. A study in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, where the drug is available without a prescription, linked use with sudden infant death syndrome, or SIDS, and found that it can cause obstruction of infants' breathing passages during sleep, the health group said. The study found that children who died of SIDS were 10 times more likely to have been given Phenergan or a related drug recently than children in a control group. About 5,000 infants die of SIDS each year in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Its cause is unknown, but Phenergan is believed to be a contributing factor, the research group said. `` Even if only a small percentage of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> SIDS deaths are caused by prescription Phenergan, the increase in such deaths expected with OTC -LRB- over-the-counter -RRB- availability adds up to a senseless and avoidable tragedy,'' the letter said. Dr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Naeye </PERSON>, chairman of the pathology department at the <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, has done extensive research on SIDS and is one of the six experts who wrote the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> supporting the health group's petition. He said that while studies have not proven a connection between SIDS and Phenergan they have found an association between the two that needs more study. `` It's an unresolved issue, but I do n't think it's good to resolve it by putting it on the market over the counter,'' he said. <PERSON> Naeye </PERSON> said that while he generally endorses the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s push to make more drugs available without prescription, `` in this case, it's not prudent.''

 About a mile south of the tiny Tohono O'odham Indian village of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguel </LOCATION>, a pickup truck crossed from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> through an open gate in the barbed wire that constitutes the international border. The truck, carrying 500 pounds of cocaine, started along a winding, dirt road known as Indian Route 19. It then headed north for <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> and to major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities for distribution. As the truck continued its journey, two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs agents, both Tohono O'odham Indians, popped onto the road in a four-wheel-drive vehicle and chased it. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agents took a .357 - caliber Magnum, the $ 45 million cocaine cache and the truck and charged 21-year-old <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Loya </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chihuahua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, with conspiracy and other The March 23 arrest was similar to one played out almost daily as federal, state and local law enforcement officers fight a narcotics flood pouring across the border. The 360-mile-long <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> border has become the latest chessboard in the deadly game of drug trafficking, primarily because of the success of anti-drug task forces in southern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. `` We have seen a tremendous increase in the amount of drugs coming into <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, chief agent for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>. `` We're able in many instances to trace it directly back to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> offers a variety of advantages to traffickers. `` It's a very porous border and then there is the human connection because of family contacts'' on both sides that `` makes it an ideal situation for the smuggler,'' he said. Other factors include the rugged terrain and sparse border population _ only <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nogales </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luis </LOCATION> have populations of more than 1,000; and the logistics _ one major <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> highway runs 25 yards south of the border. `` They can throw a package over the fence, and it's in this country,'' <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> said. An unprecedented rash of violence has accompanied the new drug trade, authorities said. During the last three weeks, the bodies of five men, bound, tortured and stabbed, were found in a <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> shed; and in <LOCATION> Agua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prieta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, about 125 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, the bodies of nine men and three women were discovered similarly bound, tortured, mutilated and shot. All had been dumped in a well or covered with lime in a septic tank. <LOCATION> Pima </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Dupnik </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Agua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prieta </LOCATION> slayings `` are directly connected, with the same persons responsible.'' They have been characteristic of some of those of the notorious Colombian <PERSON> Medillin </PERSON> cartel, said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> McDermott </PERSON>, the head <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agent in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. `` We've seen that sort of brutality in south <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>.'' Authorities have not drawn any connection between the slayings and the mutilations of 15 people near <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The increased volume in drug trafficking and violence prompted Sen. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>., to vow last week to press <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to fund the remaining $ 1.9 billion promised in last year's omnibus drug bill `` I'm prepared to raise taxes'' and to cut other programs, he said. Border Patrol chief agent <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Dowdy </PERSON>, whose sector includes most of the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> border, said his agents seized 85,000 pounds of marijuana in fiscal 1988. `` To date, we have exceeded 107,000 pounds for fiscal'89, which began Oct. 1,'' he said recently. <PERSON> McDermott </PERSON> said the step-up in violence was anticipated as cocaine seizures in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> soared from 100 pounds in 1985 to almost 10,000 pounds a year currently. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bagley </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> special agent in charge in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, said his office now routinely gets numerous drug-related queries weekly from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and elsewhere on cases that `` all lead back to <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> as the focal point, the funnel from which the supply is coming. It's not so much <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> any more but <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. This is the distribution center.''

 <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> `` C.K.'' <PERSON> McClatchy </PERSON>, who lambasted some fellow publishers for putting profit over news, was remembered upon his death as a leader with `` the very highest standards.'' The 62-year-old editor and chairman of the board of <ORGANIZATION> McClatchy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION> collapsed Sunday afternoon while jogging in a park, said <PERSON> Erwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Potts </PERSON>, president of the company. He was pronounced dead a short time later at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, apparently of heart attack. <PERSON> Potts </PERSON> said <PERSON> McClatchy </PERSON> had no history of heart problems. `` He was a very healthy guy and he took good care of himself. ... It's just a shock to all of us. `` He was a hell of a newspaper man and he was a hell of a guy. We're just going to miss him an awful lot,'' said <PERSON> Potts </PERSON>, who had known <PERSON> McClatchy </PERSON> for 13 years. <PERSON> McClatchy </PERSON> was heir to a news empire that dated to the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Gold Rush. His family's newspaper group publishes 12 West Coast newspapers, including The Sacramento Bee; the <ORGANIZATION> Anchorage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, which won this year's Pulitzer Prize for public service; The <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION> Bee and The Modesto Bee; and The Morning News Tribune in <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Tri-City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, publisher and chief executive officer of the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, called <PERSON> McClatchy </PERSON> `` a splendid newspaper leader who represented the very highest standards of editorial and managerial excellence. `` He was uncommonly dedicated to quality in his newspapers,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. `` His passing is a major loss to our profession.'' <PERSON> McClatchy </PERSON> blasted fellow publishers in a January 1988 speech, saying many paid more attention to profit margins than quality journalism. He told an audience at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION>, that some media groups used their publications as `` ever-faithful cash cows for the owners.'' `` C.K. represents everything that was good about journalism and newspapering,'' said <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Favre </PERSON>, executive editor of The Sacramento Bee. `` His values, his concerns, his integrity, his gentleness and his toughness, his generosity, his intellect, his curiousity and his caring created an environment which inspired all around him to do their best,'' <PERSON> Favre </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON>, managing editor of the <ORGANIZATION> Anchorage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, said that since <PERSON> McClatchy </PERSON>'s purchase of the paper a decade ago, the company provided it financial support `` to literally go from being on its deathbed to being the state's leading newspaper.'' <PERSON> McClatchy </PERSON>'s company became embroiled in a legal dispute in 1984 with then-Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON>, a close friend of <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and one-time <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate for president, after The Sacramento Bee and two other newspapers in the group published a story in 1983 on the <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON> family's ownership of a hotel-casino in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> during the 1970s It said federal agents believed someone had illegally skimmed profits from the casino to cut its tax liability. <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON> filed a $ 250 million libel suit against the McClatchy newspapers. When the suit was settled in 1987, the papers issued a statement saying `` extensive discovery'' found no evidence of skimming. Both sides claimed victory. <PERSON> McClatchy </PERSON>, born March 25, 1927, in <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION>, earned his undergraduate degree at <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in 1950. He served in the Army from 1951 to 1953, and reported for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> from 1953 to 1955. The next two years, he was assistant press secretary to <PERSON> Adlai </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON> in the Democrat's second unsuccessful presidential campaign against <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>. In 1957, <PERSON> McClatchy </PERSON> returned to reporting, with <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. He joined The <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> Bee in 1958, starting as a reporter and working his way to associate editor in 1962. He was named editor of <ORGANIZATION> McClatchy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION> in 1974, elected company president in 1978, replacing his aunt <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> McClatchy </PERSON> and made chairman in 1988. In Feburary 1988, <ORGANIZATION> McClatchy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION> offered public stock for the first time, but control remained under <PERSON> McClatchy </PERSON> and six other family members and several family trusts. <PERSON> McClatchy </PERSON> was the great-grandson of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McClatchy </PERSON>, an Irish immigrant who came to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in 1857, became a reporter on the newly founded <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bee </LOCATION>, and purchased the newspaper a short time later. He passed the newspaper to son, C.K. <PERSON> McClatchy </PERSON>, who was editor and chairman of the company for 53 years until his death in 1936. His daughter <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> was the next president. <PERSON> McClatchy </PERSON> also was a member of the Pulitzer Prize Board, the <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advertising </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors, <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journalism </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> board of trustees and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors executive committee.

 Soldiers dislodged Moslem guerrillas blocking the highway that connects the Soviet border to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, and convoys of food and fuel are expected to reach the capital soon, the government said Monday. <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Amani </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, also said the insurgents had new weapons and planned increased attacks on <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, 75 miles east of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. A special security court in the capital convicted a 23-year-old Palestinian of spying for the guerrillas trying to oust the Soviet-sponsored government. <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> told reporters government troops overcame blockades the insurgents had established at two points on the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION>, which runs north for 260 miles through the <LOCATION> Hindu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kush </LOCATION> mountain range to the Soviet border. Although insurgents had virtually closed the highway, about 100 supply trucks broke through last week, becoming the first convoy to arrive in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> since April 6. <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said he expected 600 trucks stranded on the road to arrive soon, but gave no details. About 65 trucks left <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, which the rebels besieged March 6 in their first major offensive after Soviet military forces completed their withdrawal Feb. 15. He said reconnaissance flights showed the insurgents to be planning a new offensive around the city, which is about 45 miles from the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> border, but did not elaborate. <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said rockets and heavy artillery rounds hit <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, wounding a civilian. He claimed 32 guerrillas, including five commanders, were killed in a retaliatory strike by government forces. Each side in the war exaggerates the other's casualties and the conflicting estimates can not be reconciled. Guerrilla spokesmen in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> reported heavy fighting outside <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> after a weekend in which the insurgents claimed to have have captured seven government outposts. They and <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> also reported fighting at <LOCATION> Khost </LOCATION>, another eastern garrison town about 75 miles to the south. The Afghan News Agency of the seven-party guerrilla alliance based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> quoted a commander named <PERSON> Fazli </PERSON> <PERSON> Haq </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhajid </PERSON> as saying insurgents breached <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>'s southern defenses for the first time in the offensive. In <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, the national security court convicted <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Razaq </PERSON> of spying for the guerrillas. The three-judge panel said the young Palestinian deserved the death penalty but was sentenced to 16 years in prison because he asked for mercy. <PERSON> Razaq </PERSON> was found guilty of illegally entering <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, military spying, collaborating with insurgents and trying to persuade soldiers to defect. He admitted entering <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> illegally, but said his purpose was to preach the Islamic faith. `` I am not a professional killer,'' he told the court. `` I came to make peace between two -LRB- guerrilla -RRB- commanders. I am not a spy. My objective was to remove tension between two disputing sides.'' Soldiers who stormed a guerrilla hideout in northwestern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> arrested <PERSON> Razaq </PERSON> in December, prosecutors said. <PERSON> Razaq </PERSON> said his home was in a refugee camp in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. On April 5, the court convicted two Pakistanis of spying. One was sentenced to 16 years, the other to 18 years. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> are major supporters of the guerrillas, who began fighting after a communist coup in April 1978. Soviet forces entered the war in December 1979 and withdrew nine years later under a U.N.-mediated agreement.

 The nation's tobacco farmers are hoping to boost production this year, and one of the reasons is the thriving overseas demand for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cigarettes and unrolled leaf. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, almost one of every six cigarettes made in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1988 went to foreign buyers. More than two of every five pounds of tobacco leaf produced by farmers last year were exported. Sustained increases in foreign demand have more than offset the continued decline in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cigarette use, meaning that the department's annual quotas for flue-cured and burley tobacco have been increased for the 1989 season. In response, tobacco farmers have indicated they intend to plant 713,000 acres this year, up 13 percent from 1988. With average yields, this year's total tobacco harvest could increase by about 15 percent. The department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> says in its latest analysis that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cigarette production rose about 1 percent in 1988 to an estimated 695 billion `` pieces.'' Americans smoked 562.5 billion cigarettes last year, about 2 percent fewer than in 1987. But cigarette exports rose more than 18 percent last year to 118.5 billion pieces, while shipments of leaf rose 12 percent to an equivalent of 578 million pounds farm sales weight _ about 17 percent of the 1988 tobacco output of 1.35 billion pounds. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is the world's leading tobacco exporter as well as the largest importer,'' the report said. Back in the early 1960s, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> exported about 30 percent of its tobacco. In recent years, exports accounted for 38 percent of the crop. However, there has been a rise in competition, and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> share of the world market has dropped by half _ from a 28 percent share in 1970 to 14 percent in 1987. Last year, the report said, the value of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tobacco exports was a record $ 4.15 billion, up 22 percent from calendar 1987, the previous high. The total included $ 1.25 billion worth of unmanufactured tobacco and $ 2.9 billion in products, mostly cigarettes. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, some 105 countries bought <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tobacco last year. About 60 percent of the cigarettes went to <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> countries, while <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> traditionally is the largest buyer of leaf, which is used to blend into domestically produced products. Despite the recent pickup in leaf exports, they continue to hold below the annual levels during most of the 1970s and early 1980s. Higher excise taxes are reducing or slowing the growth of cigarette sales in some countries, the report said. And the high costs of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tobacco, together with the dollar's strength in the early 1980s, prompted some to shift to other sources, notably <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>. Even with comparatively lower <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prices since 1985, there is still `` stiff competition from less expensive foreign stocks,'' the report said. Last year, for the first time since 1980, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> was the leading buyer of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tobacco leaf, followed by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, which was the No. 1 market the previous seven years. But that was mainly because <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> reduced 1988 imports after buying unusually large quantities the previous year.

 A toll-free consumer meat and poultry hotline operated by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> generated about 50,000 telephone calls last year, most of them asking for information about food safety. <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Burkholder </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the agency that handles meat and poultry inspection programs, reports that the number of calls during the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 increased 6 percent from 1987. <PERSON> Burkholder </PERSON> said about 30,000 of the calls came in during <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s regular business hours, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. EST After hours and on weekends, callers heard taped educational messages, such as tips on safe food preparation, suggestions for transporting foods or information on product recalls. `` Approximately 70 percent of callers asked about basic food safety,'' she said in the spring issue of <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s Food News magazine. `` These questions concerned how long a specific meat or poultry item could be safely stored, how to minimize the risk of illness from eating raw or lightly cooked eggs or how to judge when turkey is done.'' About 5 percent of the calls were about salmonella, with most wanting to know how the bacteria cause food poisoning, while others were interested in federal programs designed to control salmonella. Repeat callers accounted for 12 percent of last year's calls, <PERSON> Burkholder </PERSON> said. The number of the toll-free hotline, now in its fourth year, is 1-800-535-4555.

<HEAD>Officials Unveil New, Progressive Tax Structure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> introduced a new, progressive income tax that will abolish payments by the poor and increase rates threefold for wealthier citizens. Finance Minister <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gostev </PERSON> said the new tax structure reflects growing differences in income. In an interview published Monday in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Pravda, <PERSON> Gostev </PERSON> said the new tax structure becomes effective in January and is the first change in 46 years. On Sunday, Pravda published the tax structure in the form of a draft law. The draft must be approved by the government before it becomes law. Soviets currently pay a flat 10 percent of their income in taxes if they make less than the equivalent of $ 320 a month. The rate increases a few percentage points for higher incomes. Under the draft, people making more than $ 2,400 a month will pay 50 percent of their earnings to the treasury. <PERSON> Gostev </PERSON> said only 3.4 percent of Soviet workers make more than the equivalent of $ 800 a month, and that most Soviets wo n't be affected by the new tax structure. The new structure calls for abolishing tax payments by people who make less than $ 130 a month _ just above the amount government officials consider the minimum necessary to get by in Soviet society. It also provides for reduced taxes for earners of less than $ 160 monthly, with officials determining later how big the reduction should be. Most industrial workers make $ 347 a month. The structure sets a tax rate of 12.2 percent for incomes of $ 1,120 a month increasing progressively to the 50 percent ceiling. Most taxes are withheld at the workplace, and workers do not need to file annual tax returns. The finance minister said cooperatives, individuals who have struck out on their own to produce goods and services and other reforms fostered by President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> `` have raised the level of material security of Soviet citizens and at the same time raised the differentiation of the population's income.'' They need a new tax structure to reflect those changes, he said. Wage-earners with four or more dependents are eligible for a tax cut of 30 percent of the new rates, according to the published report. Soviet taxpayers who earn money from several difference sources now must pay separately on each of the sources. <PERSON> Gostev </PERSON> said the new law unifies all income sources so people pay on total income. It includes stiff penalties for tax evaders, he said. In October, several Soviet economists said an overhaul of the tax structure was essential to distribute income more equitably and expose those who have made fortunes on the black market. `` To search for some kind of scientific approach in our system of taxation is useless,'' Deputy Finance Minister <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> Semyonov </PERSON> told the weekly <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. Another economist, <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaroshenko </PERSON>, said a yearly report of income and expenditures `` would serve as a means of strong economic and psychological action most of all against the system of organized crime.''

 It's only a student body vote, but state officials will be watching closely this week when <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> holds the first election by computer in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. If voter turnout is as big as organizers hope, the election Tuesday and Wednesday could be the largest in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ever conducted on computers and a harbinger of general elections in the 21st century. The Stanford computers will be programmed with a variety of safeguards to discourage hackers and vote fraud. If the voter tries something funny with the keyboard, for example, the computer will make noise to summon a poll watcher. `` We're observing the <LOCATION> Stanford </LOCATION> election as an interesting experiment,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mott-Smith </PERSON>, coordinator of voter outreach programs for the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> secretary of state's office. `` Computers are becoming increasingly useful in a variety of ways. One of those ways could be elections.'' An election last week at <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> drew 3,159 voters, believed to be the largest turnout at a computer election so far in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION>'s enrollment of 13,000 is smaller than BU's, but a typical <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> election draws about 5,000 voters, organizers said. `` It was very simple, a lot easier than the old system,'' said BU senior <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, who used a Macintosh `` mouse,'' a hand-held device that transmits instructions to the computer, to make his choices instead of a pen or pencil. Though though system at <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> got generally good reviews, a disk failure caused 248 votes last week to go uncounted. A computer scientist is checking to see whether the missing votes can be retrieved, but they were n't enough to have affected the outcome of any of the races there anyway. Although <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> has no plans to hold computerized elections, officials are intrigued by <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION>'s experiment and hope to see how secure and `` user-friendly'' the system proves to be. The election is expected to cost at least $ 3,000 less than the $ 13,000 spent last year, and allow votes to be counted within two hours instead of five days. `` It's interesting for us to see how the bright minds of <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, in conjunction with <LOCATION> Silicon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, are going to deal with the questions of how voters interact with the equipment,'' <PERSON> Mott-Smith </PERSON> said. omputers are n't completely unknown on Election Day, of course. In many locations, voters use a stylus to punch holes in cards that are then counted by computers, like the keypunch cards that were a staple of computer departments until the last decade or so. But with that kind of voting system, or the old-fashioned paper ballots, the paper remains as a backup if there is a problem or a call for a recount. `` How a computer can duplicate that integrity is an interesting question,'' <PERSON> Mott-Smith </PERSON> said. `` The bottom line is the people have to have confidence that the system is accurate.'' Stanford student election officials think they've got a fraud-proof system that's easy to use and should take each voter only about three minutes. The software was developed by a student, sophomore <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON>. `` If the computer detects that it's being tampered with in some manner, it will make a lot of loud noises and alert the poll watcher,'' said elections commissioner <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Krauss </PERSON>, also a sophomore. But paper ballots will still be used by students at <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION>'s three overseas campuses, for absentee ballots and for those who refuse to use the Macintosh computers `` There will probably always be people on campus who do n't know how to use a ` Mac' and are dreadfully afraid of using the machine,'' <PERSON> Krauss </PERSON> said. `` For those who fall into that category _ who would like to vote but there's no way on God's green earth they're going to touch one of these machines _ we will have paper and pencils available.''

<TEXT>
 The defense rested Monday without presenting any witnesses in the murder trial of a <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> couple accused of letting their 7-year-old diabetic daughter die without medical attention. Former banker <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hermanson </PERSON>, 42, and his wife, <PERSON> Christine </PERSON>, 38, are charged with third-degree murder and felony child abuse. <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION> Circuit Judge <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dakan </PERSON> said he expected the six jurors to begin deliberations Tuesday after closing arguments and his instructions. <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hermanson </PERSON> was aided by spiritual healers but not doctors before her death in September 1986. The Hermansons' attorneys claimed the couple were acting legally under a 1975 <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> law allowing parents to withhold medical treatment from their sick children if they are `` legitimately practicing'' their religious beliefs. <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> tenets rely on prayer and spiritual practitioners rather than on medicine to heal illness. There are no church sanctions, however, for followers who seek medical aid. The couple have a right to practice their religion `` but not the right to allow a child to die,'' Assistant <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION> State Attorney <PERSON> Deno </PERSON> <PERSON> Economou </PERSON> said during the week-long trial. On Friday, defense attorneys successfully blocked the testimony of a family friend who said out of the jury's presence that <PERSON> Amy </PERSON>'s parents had in the past obtained medical care for themselves but did n't get the insulin injections that expert witnesses said could have saved their child's life Attorney <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> said the surprise testimony by <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Christman </PERSON> violated trial rules requiring lawyers to notify the other side of damaging testimony expected to be introduced. The prosecutors acknowledged their inaction but gave no explanation, and the judge ruled the testimony inadmissible.

<HEAD>As Costs Rise for Poor, Number of Available Homes Shrinks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Despite increases in federal spending and the number of families being helped, poor families face an ever-growing shortage of low-rent homes and apartments, according to a private study of government data released Monday. More of the poor were forced to pay more for housing because of soaring costs from 1978 to 1985, said the study, entitled `` A Place to Call Home.'' The study was produced by two advocacy groups that generally advocate increased resources for social programs, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and the <ORGANIZATION> Low </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Income </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The authors used data from a 1985 housing survey. The various findings of the study are captured in one statistic: The proportion of poor renting families who pay at least 60 percent of their income for rent and utilities rose from 44 percent in 1978 to 55 percent in 1985. Among poor owners, the proportion rose from 31 percent to 38 percent. Half of all poor renting households paid at least $ 266 a month in 1985, up from the 1978 figure of $ 229. In the 1970s and 1980s, housing demand increased while supply shrank, the study said. The number of households with cash incomes below the official poverty line rose 25 percent from 10.5 million to 13.3 million from 1978 to 1985. That line was $ 8,573 for a family of three in 1985. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> guidelines consider housing `` affordable'' if it takes no more than 30 percent of family income. The number of houses and apartments available for a monthly rent of $ 250 or less _ 30 percent of the income of a family making $ 10,000 a year _ was 9.7 million in 1970, or 2.4 million more than the comparable number of families. In 1978, there were still 370,000 more units than familes, but by 1985 the number of families had risen to 11.6 million while the number of houses and apartments available at $ 250 or less had fallen to 7.9 million _ a deficit of 3.7 million affordable housing units. Of the 7.9 million, 800,000 were vacant and 1.5 million were occupied by families with incomes above the poverty line. The primary cause of the disappearance of low-cost housing, according to <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Zigas </PERSON>, executive secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Low </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Income </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, was `` upgrading, abandonment and changes in use,'' including gentrification in some cities, as well as `` substantial cost escalation in housing.'' `` Our housing resources are filtering up rather than down'' the income scale, he said.

<TEXT>
 Here are the major features of the package President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> unveiled Monday to reward <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> for its recent steps toward democracy and to encourage further political and economic reforms. _ Trade concessions The administration will submit to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> legislation to lower <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tariffs on a variety of Polish goods. This would be accomplished by putting <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> under the Generalized System of Preferences, which gives this form of trade relief to selected countries with low per-capita incomes. The administration estimates the value to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> at $ 3.5 million to $ 25 million annually, depending on what products benefit from tariff reductions and how aggressively <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> reacts to the lowered tariffs. _ Old loans <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called for other wealthy western nations to join the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in giving <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> easier terms for paying back its $ 38 billion foreign debt, only $ 2.4 billion of which is owed to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But the debt stretch-out would be conditioned on economic reforms by the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> government. Administration sources said the step could lead to the rescheduling of up to $ 700 million in existing debt. _ New loans The administration said it would support conditional new loans to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> from the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, but suggested they should be tied to movement toward `` market-oriented economic policies.'' The White House did not put a dollar value on the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> loans. Some official sources have suggested the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> loans could total $ 300 million if <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> meets all the requirements, followed perhaps by $ 250 million more from the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. _ Business investment The package provides a variety of incentives to encourage more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> business investment in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, along with joint ventures with Polish businesses. These overtures would be made conditional on <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s progress in carrying out the political and labor reforms it has promised, including recognizing Solidarity and holding free and open parlimentary elections. _ Debt-equity swaps The government proposed that <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> be permitted to reduce some of its international debt by giving <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks or other investors shares in Polish enterprises in exchange.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> on Monday told a union conference `` the president is against us'' in efforts to raise the minimum wage and urged the delegates to confront President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> when he speaks to them Tuesday. `` Maybe you can ask him this question,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> told about 3,000 delegates of the AFL-CIO Building and Construction Trades national conference. `` How is it that the president can propose a tax cut of $ 30,000 a year for the very richest Americans and yet at the same time say that 30 cents an hour for the poorest Americans is too much? I say that is wrong and that is unfair.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, was referring to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal to cut capital gains taxes and the 30 cents an hour difference between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s offer to raise the hourly minimum wage to $ 4.25 by 1992 and the $ 4.55 target contained in legislation passed by both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The White House and congressional proposals also differ on whether employers should be able to pay newly hired workers a subminimum wage. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he will not sign any increase unless there is a six-month `` training wage'' covering all new employees, while both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bills include a two-month training period with significant eligibility restrictions. A conference committee is resolving differences between the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bills before the measure can be given final passage and be sent to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has promised to veto it. The president appears to have enough votes to sustain a veto, but Democrats have decided on a vigorous campaign in favor of the bill in hopes of gaining a political edge should <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> hold fast to his veto threats. `` We're going to fight,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. `` The president is against us.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> delivered a lengthy defense of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and questioned <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign call for a `` kinder, gentler'' nation. `` We've made mistakes,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said of the Democrats. `` We've gone too far in some cases But if this is a kind and gentle nation it is Democrats who made it so, and if it is to become kinder and gentler it is Democrats who will make it so.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> also said that `` with or without'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the Democrats planned to move forward with their domestic agenda, including programs for the homeless, environment, health care and infrastructure. `` We've got a public agenda that wo n't wait and we're not going to wait,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Poll Indicates Californians Support Tighter Border Restrictions</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Californians overwhelmingly support tighter border security and immigration restrictions to stem the flow of illegal migration across the U.S.-Mexican border, according to a poll released Monday. The poll of 800 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> voters and another 272 <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego-area </LOCATION> residents showed support for a four-mile drainage ditch the federal government plans to build along the border to stop <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> motorists from driving into southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> illegally. `` Californians are strongly concerned about legal and illegal immigration into that state,'' said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reform </ORGANIZATION>, which commissioned the poll conducted April 6-9 by <ORGANIZATION> Tarrance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Associates of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. The telephone survey, showing increased concern about drug smuggling across the border and continuing illegal immigration, means that `` we may be looking at a political time bomb for elected officials,'' he said. The poll showed that 69 percent of Californians statewide supported limits on the number of legal immigrants each year. It also found that 60 percent supported the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s plan to build a four-mile drainage ditch in a desert area of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> to stop motorists from speeding across unpatrolled border areas. The ditch was supported by 57 percent of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego-area </LOCATION> residents, while 31 percent of this group said they opposed the plan. Statewide, 28 percent were opposed. The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> sample had a margin of error of 5.9 percent. The poll was released two days before the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> debates a proposed resolution to oppose the ditch. A number of Hispanic political groups have lined up against the proposal. But <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> says the poll shows Hispanic Californians support the ditch by a 61-33 percent margin and that Hispanics generally support tougher measures to stem illegal immigration. `` Hispanics, like all other Americans are concerned about competition on the bottom of the job ladder,'' <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> said. But the poll also showed that Hispanics split 52-44 percent when asked if they supported erection of secure fences and barriers to thwart illegal border crossings. In January, FAIR issued an extensive study proposing construction of sunken concrete walls and secure fences to tighten border security. The organization's membership includes <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>'s former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> governor, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamm </PERSON>, former Sen. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Huddleston </PERSON>, D-Ky., and former Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> French </PERSON> Of those surveyed in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> area, 31 percent said they opposed the ditch while 12 percent said they were unsure. Statewide, 28 percent opposed construction of the ditch while 11 percent said they were unsure. The poll also found overwhelming support among Californians for increased border security to curb drug smuggling. Sixty-eight percent of those surveyed statewide said they strongly felt that tighter security was needed to stop cross-border drug trafficking. Among the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> sample, the figure was 73 percent. The poll showed that 71 percent of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> voters approved a proposal to charge a $ 1 or $ 2 border crossing fee to finance more <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> inspectors at the border.

 Borrowing a fund-raising gimmick from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s wealthy socialites, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> ambassador's wife held an invitation-only fashion show at a swank downtown hotel Monday to benefit children in earthquake-stricken <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. As an added attraction, <PERSON> Liana </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON> recruited her 23-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Irena </PERSON>, as a model. A group of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> wives, swept up in the spirit of glasnost, pitched in to serve tea, sandwiches and pastries for about 100 high-society customers. It was the first time in memory that the Soviet Embassy had sponsored a benefit fashion show, a fund-raising event traditionally favored by the philanthropy-minded wives of wealthy American capitalists. Mrs. <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON>, the Armenian-born wife of Soviet ambassador <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON>, welcomed such <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> socialites as <PERSON> Buffy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cafritz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> <PERSON> Coopersmith </PERSON> to the mezzanine of the Madison Hotel for the opening of the three-day fashion show. Iranian-born designer <PERSON> Cleopatra </PERSON> <PERSON> Broumand </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> donated Italian knits, scarves and original evening wear designs for the event. The wholesale prices, about half of what the Cleopatra label usually fetches, ranged from $ 150 for a knit ensemble to $ 3,000 for an evening gown. <PERSON> Irena </PERSON>, a graduate student in political science, said she agreed to model the clothes `` just for fun.'' Born in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> while her father was <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Irena </PERSON> is a graduate of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and is studying for a master's degree with emphasis on recent U.S.-Spanish relations. During her college years, her father was ambassador to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. A twin sister, <PERSON> Tatiana </PERSON>, lives in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON>, who came to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with her husband nearly three years ago, has a particular concern for the plight of Armenians who suffered in last December's devastating earthquake. Her father, who now lives in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, was an engineer in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> when she was born, she said, and many of her relatives still live there. Besides her Armenian father, she said, her mother was from <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. `` My husband says that is a very dangerous combination,'' she said with a laugh. The benefit committee supporting the fashion show included <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>, former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Protocol Chief <PERSON> Selwa </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> and the wives of foreign diplomats and of former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartman </PERSON>, former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.

 Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, introduced legislation Monday that would require the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to notify taxpayers when they overpay their taxes. `` The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> should be honest with taxpayers _ not try to hide from them that they have paid more than they rightfully owe,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat, said in a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> speech. `` We expect taxpayers to pay their fair share, but not an extra share.'' The bill grew out of a disclosure last month that the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> instructed employees matching tax returns with income forms, such as the W-2 for wages and the 1099 for interest and pension payments, to keep quiet when such examination disclosed overpayment. The overpayment usually resulted when a taxpayer failed to subtract taxes withheld from taxes owed.

 <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s attorney predicted Monday the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee will find no rules violations when it considers whether `` clear and convincing'' evidence exists of improper conduct by the speaker. Lawyer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Oldaker </PERSON>, rebutting all the charges in the committee's statement of alleged violations, said they were based on `` a mischaracterization of facts ... outrageous readings of legislative history ... retroactive writing of the rules ... doublespeak.'' <PERSON> Oldaker </PERSON> commented after committee chairman <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Calif., announced the panel was charging the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat with 69 violations of House rules In a lengthy statement, the panel found `` reason to believe'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> had broken rules requiring reporting of gifts, barring acceptance of gifts from persons with a direct interest in legislation and limiting outside earned income. Both <PERSON> Oldaker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> emphasized the committee's allegations were based only on a `` reason to believe'' that rules were violated. In order for the panel to declare actual violations took place and to recommend punishment by the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, it must find `` clear and convincing evidence,'' `` I am confident they will find no rules violations clearly and convincingly proved,'' said <PERSON> Oldaker </PERSON>, who particularly criticized the committee's special outside counsel, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, for its report Monday. The Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, the panel's formal name, charged that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s friend and business partner, <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, real estate developer and investor <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>, improperly provided $ 145,000 worth of gifts over a 10-year period The committee found that <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> had a direct interest in legislation before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, making it a violation of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules for <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> to accept more than $ 100 in gifts in a calendar year. <PERSON> Oldaker </PERSON> called the allegation that <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> had a direct interest in legislation `` one of the most outrageous readings of legislative history.'' He called <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> `` a close personal friend'' of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> who had `` interest in oil and an interest in real estate. That covers everyone in the country.'' The attorney said <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> `` never asked the speaker to do anything for himself or anyone else.'' The committee charged <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> with failing to report the benefits he received from <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> as gifts on his annual financial disclosure forms. The items deemed `` gifts'' by the ethics committee included free housing from 1979 through 1984 in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, valued at $ 31,698; cut-rate housing from 1985 through 1988, valued at $ 21,790; an $ 18,000-a-year salary paid to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON>, from 1981 through 1984, totaling $ 72,000, and the use and maintenance of a 1979 Cadillac from 1983 through 1988, valued at $ 19,391. According to <PERSON> Oldaker </PERSON>, it was <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>'s practice `` to have employees live for free'' in the same <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> condominium complex he let the <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s use. <PERSON> Oldaker </PERSON> said <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> wrongly implied that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON>, was incompetent when she worked for the investment company founded by <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> and their wives. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s lawyer said former colleagues of Mrs. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> told the committee she worked five to seven days a month, when she `` went out and looked at various investments and talked to people.'' He said Mrs. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was not successful in the ventures and left no written record of her work. The car was owned by the Wright-Mallick firm, and `` the speaker never believed the car was a gift,'' <PERSON> Oldaker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was accused by the committee of having `` an overall scheme'' to evade <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> limits on outside earned income by, in seven instances, selling bulk quantities of his book `` Reflections of a Public Man'' to groups to which he had delivered speeches. The panel said that action, in effect, converted money that should have been speaking fees _ limited under <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules _ into book royalties, which are not under the limits. In an eighth instance, the panel said, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> received an undisclosed gift because books paid for by a private individual were not delivered. <PERSON> Oldaker </PERSON> said the committee found problems with only seven speeches during a three-year period when <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> gave 750 talks. On the disclosure question, <PERSON> Oldaker </PERSON> said, `` Public disclosure was made, which is the essence of everything. <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s salary was disclosed. The book royalties were disclosed. There was a lot of noise, a lot of clamoring, but very little substance.''

 The cost of loving is going up. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, after years of allowing manufacturers free use of the `` I Love <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'' logo, will start charging royalties this year. People who print the logo on sweatshirts, key chains, pens or other consumer goods will be forced to give <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state 6 percent to 10 percent of the money they make, said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Morello </PERSON>, a state deputy commissioner for economic development. The state has spent more than $ 100 million advertising itself to tourists since launching the `` I Love <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'' advertising campaign in 1977, he said. The state registered the motto with a red heart symbol in place of the word `` love.'' Though the symbol has been adapted for a variety of bumper stickers and other uses, the state only holds the trademark for loving <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` We think this is one modest way to begin recapturing some of the investment without negatively impacting the motto's effectiveness,'' <PERSON> Morello </PERSON> said State officials have watched with great interest the success of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> raisins advertising campaign, which has branched off into lucrative records, touring cartoon characters and other products, he said. A licensing agent will be hired to help market the logo, which tourism officials refer to in news releases as `` legendary.'' Up until now, the state has allowed manufacturers to include `` I Love <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'' in anything deemed appropriate, figuring it's helping the state advertise itself, he said Manufacturers who already use the logo will be allowed a certain period of time to sell off their inventory before they have to start paying, he said.

It should have happened a long time ago,'' said <PERSON> Gregorz </PERSON> <PERSON> Maracewicz </PERSON>, a Solidarity supporter who works in the science office of the <PERSON> Roza </PERSON> <PERSON> Luksemburg </PERSON> light-bulb factory. `` We will have to see what they -LRB- Solidarity -RRB- will do, but it will make a great difference for all of us,'' he said before heading home in a driving spring snowstorm after his shift. `` It's a good thing. It should change things, but it's hard to say whether Solidarity can do it all by itself,'' said a factory employee and former Solidarity member who declined to give her name. At the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION>, near where the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> branch of Solidarity had its offices during its first 16 months of legality, employees welcomed the decision. `` I am very happy. I really think it's a historic moment. I think registration was the first condition of all the changes which are going to improve things when there is more democracy,'' said sociologist <PERSON> Krystyna </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewinska </PERSON>. `` I do n't give interviews,'' said another institute employee who walked away and smiled. He then turned his head and added, `` But I am very happy.'' Most of those interviewed who were members of the union during its legal phase in 1980-81 said they would join again. `` That's obvious,'' said <PERSON> Alina </PERSON> <PERSON> Jablonska </PERSON>, an employee in a design office now on maternity leave, when asked if she would become a member again. `` We are full of hope. The whole society, at least my community, believes our life problems should disappear, perhaps not so soon, but in the long term,'' she said. An elderly woman, who like <PERSON> Jablonska </PERSON> was standing in line for meat at the <LOCATION> Hala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mirowska </LOCATION> market, disagreed. `` It does n't matter who rules. What matters is that things should be good in this country so that I should n't have to stand in line for a piece of meat,'' said the woman, a retired factory worker who was a member of Solidarity in 1980-81. `` I do n't think anything will change,'' she added, declining to give her name. Authorities and the opposition hope the legalization of Solidarity will provide social calm needed for economic reforms to take effect. Chronic consumer shortages and the failure of wages to keep pace with inflation sparked two crippling waves of strikes in May and August 1988. Service on <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s $ 38 billion debt eats up hard currency needed for investments to modernize industry. In light of such problems, some Poles want to wait and see what the union can do before joining. The union once boasted 10 million members out of the 18 million-member workforce, but <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> has said he expects 5 million to 7 million in the new Solidarity. Others demonstrated their commitment to Solidarity even before the decision to register the union was officially announced. `` We organized when Solidarity was illegal, underground, so we are not used to this new situation. We represent committees already organized in our region. The big difference will be our freedom of action,'' said <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarosz </PERSON>. The 26-year-old construction worker and three of his friends took the overnight train from their home in <LOCATION> Gorzow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wielkopolski </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> so they could hold up a Solidarity banner in the courtroom where the decision was read.

<TEXT>
 Full-page newspaper advertisements formally announced Monday that one of <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>'s most popular brands of toothpaste is changing its name from Darkie to <PERSON> Darlie </PERSON>. After more than three years of pressure from blacks, religious groups, politicians and others, <ORGANIZATION> Colgate-Palmolive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> decided in January that <PERSON> Darkie </PERSON> would have to go and its distinctive box be redesigned. For more than 60 years, the <PERSON> Darkie </PERSON> trademark was a grinning, top-hatted minstrel in blackface. Also on the box is its name in Chinese, which literally means `` black man toothpaste.'' <ORGANIZATION> Colgate-Palmolive </ORGANIZATION> said it would phase in the new name on packaging and advertising this year and use a racially ambiguous face under the top hat. However, Monday's advertisement in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Straits </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> carried the same grinning blackface logo. No explanation was immediately available. The toothpaste, manufactured by <PERSON> Hawley </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Hazel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Hong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> -RRB- </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, got its trademark after a company executive visited the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and saw the late <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Jolson </PERSON>. The white entertainer gained fame as a singer in blackface, and the company decided his wide smile and bright white teeth would be ideal to promote their product. A company spokeswoman said <PERSON> Darkie </PERSON> held 75 percent of the toothpaste market in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, 50 percent in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, 30 percent in <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and 20 percent in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. It was never distributed outside <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Darkie </PERSON> started setting some teeth on edge after the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> conglomerate <ORGANIZATION> Colgate-Palmolive </ORGANIZATION> paid $ 50 million for a 50 percent stake in 1985. What was show biz in the 1920s is offensive racial imagery today, and members of the <ORGANIZATION> Interfaith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Responsibility </ORGANIZATION> started prodding for change. More than 240 church groups belong to the New York-based non-profit center. After a three-day visit to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> in December, six <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressmen also accused the company of perpetuating racial stereotypes. In a statement initiated by Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Mich., they said <PERSON> Darkie </PERSON> was one of many examples of racism in consumer products in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> <PERSON> Hawley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hazel </PERSON> tried to satisfy the critics and sustain the brand's appeal among Asians by test-marketing the several names, including <PERSON> Dakkie </PERSON>, pronounced `` ducky.'' Test sales in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> produced no clear preference or aversion to Darkie or <PERSON> Dakkie </PERSON>, said the company spokeswoman, who by custom is not named. The Darkie name and logo were not seen as offensive, she said. Nevertheless, <ORGANIZATION> Colgate-Palmolive </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Reuben </PERSON> <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> said in January, `` The morally right thing dictated that we must change. What we have to do is find a way to change that is least damaging to the economic interests of our partners.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials defended their 1990 African aid budget proposal Monday against a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> senator's accusations of neglect and misplaced priorities. Sen. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., told his <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> subcommmittee that despite millions of dollars in American aid, countries south of the Sahara are `` facing every imaginable problem'' today, with less economic assistance provided for the half billion people who live in the region than for nine million people in two <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> countries, <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. The senator demanded that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration halt what he called a Republican `` policy of neglect'' that he said was demonstrated by former President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s never once visiting <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` To put it bluntly,'' <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> said, `` your 1990 budget is wholly inadequate to meet the challenges. ... I want us to do more.'' <PERSON> Alison </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>, deputy assistant secretary of state for <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> affairs, acknowledged that recent appropriations for <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> `` have fallen short of allowing us to meet our earlier stated objectives.'' The 1990 request for $ 820 million in economic and $ 85 million in military assistance for sub-Saharan <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, a 10 percent increase over 1989, has the correct emphasis, she said, with 10 times as much economic as military assistance. Ms. <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> said the military aid is focussed on countries with important <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> strategic interests _ <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> _ and is a fraction of the 1958 level of 158 million. Some $ 6 million is requested for a recently launched program for civic action and coastal security aid, she said, which has `` gained us direct access to top leadership in half a dozen countries in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' Overall, she said, `` the decline in military assistance for <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> countries has put <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> reliability and credibility in jeopardy. This year, we are unable to provide sufficient funding even to support <LOCATION> Niger </LOCATION>'s two C-130'' transport planes. On the economic side, Ms. <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> described as `` a major American success'' the trend toward private enterprise and relaxation of state control over African economies.

<HEAD>Spy Agency to Build Computer Chip Plant to Make Sure of Secure Supply</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to build its own top secret computer-chip plant was spurred by the threat of sensitive technology falling `` into the wrong hands,'' according to American electronics specialists. The <ORGANIZATION> NSA </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's biggest intelligence agency, says the $ 85 million microelectronics plant being built at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Meade </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, represents a `` unique capability within the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. government.'' The move comes amid increasing concern about erosion of American chip-making expertise and manufacturing capacity in the face of stiff competition from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and other countries. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s main missions are eavesdropping on communications around the globe, encoding <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> communications and cracking foreign codes, as well as safeguarding the security of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military computers and communications systems. To carry out those missions, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> agency makes heavy use of sophisticated, powerful computers. Author <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bamford </PERSON>, an authority on the agency has reported that computers cover more than 5 -LCB- acres at its headquarters complex at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Meade </LOCATION>. According to <PERSON> Bamford </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> NSA </ORGANIZATION> has a work force topping 60,000 employees _ more than all other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> spy agencies combined _ and a budget estimated at more than $ 10 billion a year. The <ORGANIZATION> NSA </ORGANIZATION>'s public affairs office said that in September 1988 the agency signed an $ 85 million contract with <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Semiconductor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, `` to instrument and train the government to operate a state-of-the-art microelectronics fabrication facility.'' Construction of 60,000 square feet of building space to house the chip-making plant was started in January 1986 by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> and completed in October 1988, it said. `` Now National Semiconductor is outfitting the six-inch silicon wafer fabrication line,'' the <ORGANIZATION> NSA </ORGANIZATION> statement said. `` Operations are scheduled to begin in 1991, and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Semiconductor </ORGANIZATION> will train <ORGANIZATION> NSA </ORGANIZATION> personnel in the operation of the new facility over a period of 18 months.'' The agency said that `` building such a facility at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Meade </LOCATION> will enable <ORGANIZATION> NSA </ORGANIZATION> to have direct control over the production process and the security procedures necessary for safeguarding the plant. This facility represents a unique capability within the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. government.'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazan </PERSON>, a computer scientist at the <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Applied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laurel </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> NSA </ORGANIZATION> plant was aimed at dealing with the threat of `` reverse engineering'' _ efforts to figure out the functioning of a computer system by scrutinizing its key components. `` That is why they do n't want to have a process made elsewhere. ... You have coding and so on, and if that falls into the wrong hands, the other side could find out what your code is. That's why they want to keep control of it in-house,'' he said. <PERSON> Hazan </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION>, a 300,000-member professional association, said that `` we are losing the commercial semiconductor competition.'' `` Since that, in turn, is what is driving the technology, we rapidly find ourselves where in defense, if you want to build defense systems, you wo n't have the capability here. You have to go overseas and hope that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> or somebody else is willing to apply the resources to that, as opposed to something else,'' he said. <PERSON> Hazan </PERSON> added that `` if you do that, then it's a -LRB- commercial -RRB- market _ presumably they'll sell it to anybody who has the need. So it's potentially a very tricky situation.'' <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sumney </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Semiconductor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, an electronics company in Research Triangle Park, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, said that in 1982, while he was on the Pentagon staff, he chaired a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> task force on development of very high-speed integrated circuits. The task force recommended to the science board that the government `` give some consideration to putting together a facility to provide state-of-the-art integrated circuits for classified applications,'' he said. <PERSON> Sumney </PERSON> noted that another <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> task force study in 1987 also `` called attention to the fact that the government could n't put itself in a position of being dependent on foreign sources.'' Asked about the <ORGANIZATION> NSA </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to build its own chip plant, <PERSON> Sumney </PERSON> said, `` I would think that now it's even more supportable, because we've continued to erode in our ability to be competitive in world markets for integrated circuits.''

 Rioters burned cars and smashed shop windows after opposition leaders met to discuss alleged government fraud in the March presidential elections, state-run radio said. Police used tear gas to break up the disturbances Sunday in which 13 people were injured and 20 arrested, the radio said. It did not say how many people participated or where the riots began. Leaders of the three opposition parties met to challenge the March 12 vote in which Presdient <PERSON> Didier </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratsiraka </PERSON> was elected to a third term. He won the election with 62 percent of the vote and is to be sworn in Thursday. The opposition said the voting was rigged and challenged the outcome in a petition to the island nation's <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Opposition leaders asked that the election be overturned and a provisional government be set up pending new voting. <PERSON> Ratsirka </PERSON>, 52, who was chosen president by the ruling military in 1975, won his first term with more than 98 percent of the vote. In 1982, he received 80 percent of the vote against a single opponent.

<HEAD>Egyptian Official Says About 1,000 Extremists Detained in Sweep</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The country's top law enforcer said in remarks distributed Monday that about 1,000 Moslem extremists were detained this month in a nationwide sweep prompted by a riot outside a provincial mosque. Security sources said earlier that only about 100 people were rounded up. Interior Minister <PERSON> Zaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Badr </PERSON>, whose ministry oversees domestic order, gave the new figure Sunday night during a speech at <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> The state-run <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> distributed a summary of his remarks on Monday. The fundamentalist rioting, which left four people wounded, broke out April 7 in the southern city of <LOCATION> Fayoum </LOCATION> immediately after Friday prayers at a mosque. The government has accused, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel-Rahman </PERSON>, a charismatic blind preacher, of inciting his followers to violence. He was arrested on the day of the riots. The government contends that <PERSON> Abdel-Rahman </PERSON> is spiritual leader of an underground extremist group called Jihad. It blames the group for the 1981 assassination of President <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> and a later coup attempt. <PERSON> Abdel-Rahman </PERSON> was tried twice after <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>'s slaying for involvement with Jihad but was acquitted both times. Although <PERSON> Badr </PERSON> said about 1,000 extremists were detained in the sweep since the riots, he did not say how many remained in custody and on what charges. The emergency law that allows the detentions also lets authorities hold people for virtually as long as they like without charge. Badr, a practicing Moslem, said he would continue to crack down on Moslem extremists `` with the utmost firmness.'' <LOCATION> Fayoum </LOCATION> rioters demanded that the government impose <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>'s legal and social code known as <LOCATION> Sharia </LOCATION>. The rules include harsh criminal penalties, like limb amputation and flogging. The government says most Egyptian laws already conform to <LOCATION> Sharia </LOCATION>, but they do not include the code's corporal punishments.

<TEXT>
 The author of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s new plan for encouraging commerical banks to voluntarily reduce Third World debt told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Monday not to expect immediate results. Despite a $ 3.6 billion package put together last week by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> to support economic reform in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said it is too optimistic to assume that commercial banks will immediately agree on how much to cut <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s debt to them. Mexican Finance Minister <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspe </PERSON> was scheduled to begin negotiations this week with a consortium of 13 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commercial banks holding a large portion of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s $ 100 billion debt. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> told members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Approporations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that the $ 1.3 billion first-year portion of the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> package would depend on <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> negotiating debt reductions from the commercial banks. However, he said he expects negotiations to be `` lengthy'' before any agreement is announced. `` To be dead honest with you, I think you ought to be prepared to wait longer,'' he said. `` Let's not try to make the first of these transactions so big that it scares everybody to death. We do n't have to throttle the train up to a 100 miles per hour when we're first getting started.'' But Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, R-Mo., said there is a `` short time span'' for the commercial banks to step forward The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary said he was `` disappointed'' that the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> package announced last week did not include provisions for so-called debt-equity swaps. In those deals, a bank will forgive a portion of the principle or interest on a loan in exchange for an investment share in newly privatized enterprises that formerly were operated by the debtor country's government. Without naming them, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said he knew of two countries negotiating deals to write down by 20 percent loans for electric power stations that would be converted from public to private ownership. The parties involved, he said, believe that amount of money will be returned to the countries in the form of native capital that had earlier fled it. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> attempted to dispel fears that taxpayers will end up bailing out banks with Third World loans through arrangement by government-funded multilateral lending agencies like the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> to guarantee that commercial banks that reduce the loans will be paid the remaining balance. `` I do n't think anybody's going to be involved in putting more money into it than we're already putting into it,'' he said. But because countries can leverage money from the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and the loans held by commerical banks are being sold for only 25 to 60 percent of their face value, he said, the plan would allow countries to buy back a face value amount equal to 10 times the seed money, he said. `` You can get a $ 10 reduction for every dollar you spend on the process,'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said. In addition, he said, $ 9 in procurement `` comes back our way'' for every dollar of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> taxpayer funds funneled to debtor countries through the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>.

 House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> chose a friendly audience Monday to deny violating <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules in his financial dealings and to call for a swift resolution so <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> could tend to its business. `` I know in my heart I have not violated any rules of that institution,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> told 3,000 delegates to an AFL-CIO Building and Construction Trades Department conference. `` I love that institution.'' Those comments were similar to the denial he issued last week in advance of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee's report alleging 69 violations of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules. But unlike last week, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> did not give a detailed answer to each of the charges against him. Instead he delivered a lengthy defense of <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> ideals and his career and asked that the committee allow him to come before it to counter the charges immediately, `` surely within a week.'' `` We can not delay and be bogged down in acrimony,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. `` Life is too short for that. Our problems are too big for that.'' The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat said he was `` prepared to live up to'' the ultimate outcome of the investigation and then said, `` As long as I live I'm going to be working for the kind of country that does n't accept second best as good enough. It appeared that he had ended his brief discussion of the ethics charges and was moving on to other topics when he suddenly added: `` Sometimes assertive and bold leadership draws the ire of powerful forces in this country.'' At the outset of the speech it was not clear whether <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> would address the charges at all. He entered to a standing ovation that lasted several minutes and a warm introduction from <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Georgine </PERSON>, president of the Building and <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trades </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, who saluted <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> as `` a man of honor and a man of integrity.'' `` He's now under bombardment by the same right-wing element that for years has bombarded us,'' <PERSON> Georgine </PERSON> said. On a huge screeen behind <PERSON> Georgine </PERSON> was the picture of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> used on the cover of a book that figures prominently in the allegations of ethics violations. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> opened his speech with a few jokes, flashing his wide grin and saying the lengthy applause had `` almost embarrassed me, but not quite.'' There were more jokes about the welcoming. `` There are two kinds of people in this world who appreciate flattery _ men and women.'' Then came stories about how building trades unions had helped him in his 18 elections to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` I feel at home here,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said to more applause. He listed Democratic programs from the Great Depression to the last session of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and promised more in the year to come. And, before turning to the subject that had brought a dozen television cameras to the basement ballroom of a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> hotel, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> talked a bit about himself. `` I am 66 years of age,'' he told the hushe audience. `` I have had the great privilege ... of serving more than half my life in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Thanks to the friendship and the confidence of my colleagues I was elected speaker of the House. I think it is the greatest honor that can come to any lawmaker.''

<HEAD>Psychiatric Expert Admits Abuses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A top Soviet psychiatric expert said Monday that authorities in the past had abused the legal rights of mental patients in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> pulled out of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in 1983 after reports that political dissidents were held in Soviet psychiatric hospitals. The reports probably would have caused the Soviets to be expelled from the association. The organization's executive committee voted at a meeting in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, on March 29 to re-admit the Soviets, a decision yet to be ratified by the association's general assembly. `` Abuses have been committed in our psychiatry during the recent decades,'' the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency quoted <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON>, the chief psychiatric expert in the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, as saying. `` The way psychiatric patients were treated was not always correct.'' <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> spoke at the opening of a three-day symposium on the law and mental health attended by psychiatrists and lawyers from a dozen countries. <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON>, without mentioning the treatment of dissidents, said denying legal rights to psychiatric patients must be eliminated. `` This is why a decree was issued in the <LOCATION> U.S.S.R. </LOCATION> last year, laying down new rules of psychiatric treatment,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted him as saying. `` It gives the patients definite legal guarantees, showing that they are no longer rightless in the eyes of public health organs,'' <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> said. `` They now have the right to call in a lawyer, to complain to the prosecutor or the court of justice.'' The symposium is being attended by psychiatrists and lawyers specializing in psychiatric cases from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. In early March, a team of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> psychiatrists and lawyers were allowed to interview 27 patients in an unprecedented two-week tour of Soviet mental hospitals. After the tour, a group spokesman praised the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for its openness but said it was still impossible to tell whether patients were being held for their political views, an abuse of psychiatry the Soviets have pledged to end.

<TEXT>
 Wildlife officials on Monday staked out a red oak tree by a reservoir where the first pair of bald eagles to nest in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> in nearly 80 years is believed to be guarding a clutch of eggs. `` The evidence is still purely circumstantial, but the female refused to leave the nest when approached and the male has been bringing her food,'' said <PERSON> Ellie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horwitz </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the state Division of Fisheries and Wildlife. The male is <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, one of the first pairs of eagles raised and released in the restoration program begun in 1982. His mate is another state-raised bird released in 1985, Ms. <PERSON> Horwitz </PERSON> said. Over the last seven summers the state has raised and released 42 bald eagles at the <LOCATION> Quabbin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reservoir </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. Two other bald eagle pairs built nests at the reservoir this spring, and there is a possibility that a second pair could also have eggs, Ms. <PERSON> Horwitz </PERSON> said. The third pair are believed to be younger birds practicing housekeeping as <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> and his mate did last spring, she said. The last active bald eagle nest in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> was reported in Sandwich, on <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION>, in 1910, she said. At least four other states _ <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> _ also have active nests this spring, state officials said. `` The bald eagle looks to be one of our success stories,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickerson </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` The breeding population is increasing from 5 percent to 10 percent annually.'' He estimated the 48 lower states have about 2,200 breeding pairs of bald eagles, up from 500 to 600 pairs in the 1960s. <PERSON> Nickerson </PERSON> credited the banning of DDT and other pesticides, which weaken eagle egg shells, and a drop in shooting and trapping. It may take several years for eagles, which mate for life, and return to the same nests year after year, to learn how to become successful parents, Ms. <PERSON> Horwitz </PERSON> said. Normally they lay from one to three eggs and the young hatch in mid-May, she said.

<HEAD>U.S. Stepping Up Efforts to Spot Private Coverage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government is planning to increase its efforts to assure that the <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> program does not pay medical bills for which private insurance carriers are liable. The secretary of health and human services, <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, asked <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> in a letter Friday to release $ 7.5 million to begin the stepped-up enforcement plan. The <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> contingency funds would be used to make revisions in the contracts with <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> claims processors to require them to match their private insurance records with their <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> rolls, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. This would enable them to identify claims where private policies are liable for the bill. The coverage issue stems from an overlap between <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> and private health plans for elderly people who continue to work. Under the law, <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> is liable only for charges not covered by the elderly employee's private health plan. Current efforts by the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> results in annual Medicare savings of more than $ 1.8 billion, but `` <ORGANIZATION> HCFA </ORGANIZATION> has known for some time that there is potential for even greater savings,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said the department, which includes <ORGANIZATION> HCFA </ORGANIZATION>, would again propose legislation that would require all health insurers to provide information identifying those enrolled in their plans who may be eligible for <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>. `` Although our efforts to convince the Office of Management and Budget of the need for this legislation have been unsuccessful,'' recent findings of an <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> task force as well as news reports of potential savings and possibile fraud highlight the need for greater efforts, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has said it is reviewing a number of cases referred by <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> in which authorities believe <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> paid medical bills for which private carriers were liable. The department's civil division recently filed lawsuits against two private insurance companies to recover money the government claims should not have been paid by <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> reported earlier this month that its investigation of <ORGANIZATION> HCFA </ORGANIZATION> records shows as much as $ 10 billion may have been misspent over the last six years because the agency has failed to correct the billing problem. <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> currently is paying about $ 67 million this year to 88 commercial insurance companies that serve as claims processors to identify claims where private insurance carriers _ sometimes their own _ are liable. HHS Inspector General <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kusserow </PERSON> and others have said they are concerned about a possible conflict of interest in these companies' roles as a <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> contractor and commercial insurance carrier.

 The Leaning Tower of <LOCATION> Pisa </LOCATION> will be measured every three months instead of just once a year to see if seasonal change affects the landmark, scientists said Monday. Since 1913, the angle of the 800-year-old tower's lean has been measured every year in June. This year a reading was taken in March, and other measurements will be taken in June, September and December. `` There is no particular cause for alarm,'' said <PERSON> Brunetto </PERSON> <PERSON> Palla </PERSON>, a professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pisa </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are curious to see whether the change of seasons has an affect on the tower.''

 President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said Monday the government will `` react with magnanimity'' if jailed black leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> offers to promote a peaceful settlement in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s speech in Parliament appeared no different from previous government offers to free the 70-year-old African <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leader on condition he renounces his guerrilla organization's use of violence. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> has refused. It would be futile for the government to release <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> if his freedom led to heightened conflict or if he was re-arrested, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said. He cautioned he could not take any steps that may lead to `` the rejection of democratic principles and the destruction of private initiative and free enterprise.'' This appeared to be his view of what <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> would be like under the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>, which espouses socialism. `` For these reasons, the case of Mr. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> is being treated with circumspection,'' said <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, 73, who plans to retire after elections expected by mid-September. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, considered by many South African blacks as their paramount leader, has been imprisoned since 1962 on a life sentence for plotting to sabotage the white-minority government. He has been living in a staff house at a prison farm near <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> since he recovered from a bout of tuberculosis last year. If <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> shows he is willing to contribute to a peaceful settlement in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, `` the government will react with magnanimity,'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said. On another topic, the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> leader acknowledged he has had differences recently with members of his <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, but said he will ensure the disputes do not become `` unbridgeable divisions.'' `` There should not be attempts to drive a wedge between us,'' he said. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> suffered a stroke in January, and shortly after resigned as party leader.

<HEAD>Scientific Group Says Don't Rush to Restart Tritium Production</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Eleven prominent scientists are urging the government not to rush into new production of tritium, an important constituent of nuclear weapons, until the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has been sounded out about reductions in the nuclear stockpile. Tritium decays and must be replenished in nuclear weapons from time to time. None has been produced in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since the aging reactors at the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, plant were shut down a year ago for safety upgrading Officials have testified that at least one reactor must be restarted by the end of the year or the need for new tritium will become critical. Some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have said failure to restart production would amount to unilateral nuclear disarmament. The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> plans to spend $ 7.5 billion to build two new tritium-producing reactors that could be ready in 10 years. In a statement dated Sunday, the 11 scientists said that once the options were studied, `` it would be surprising not to find that tritium requirements to maintain a fully adequate stockpile'' of weapons could be met for about five years without additional production. ` It should not take as long as five years, however, to determine whether the START and other arms-reduction negotiations are likely to produce cuts sufficient to permit continued suspension of tritium production,'' the scientists said. Their statement was organized by the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, which has advocated a similar position. The signers included two Nobel Prize winners and three former staff members of the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alamos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>, the principal nuclear weapons research and development installation. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> did not immediately return a telephone call seeking comment. The fusion of atoms of tritium, which is hydrogen containing two neutrons instead of none, is the driving force of thermonuclear weapons. Other weapons use the neutron burst from the fusion of small amounts of tritium to accelerate or `` boost'' the fission reactions of plutonium, reducing the amount of plutonium required for the same explosive yield. Weapons are loaded with a surplus of tritium and reloaded when all the surplus is gone. The reloading cycle is a secret and presumably varies from weapon to weapon. The scientists noted published reports that the reloading cycle is four to six years for current weapons and 10 years for new submarine-launched missiles. The scientists advocated more frequent reloading with a smaller surplus and the use of tritium from warheads withdrawn under treaty terms or simply retired. `` Some may already have been taken into account, and some may not provide much relief.

<HEAD>Government Warns of Measures Against Chilean Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Authorities asked workers to ignore calls for a general strike Tuesday that would be the first mass protest against the military government since 1987. The General Workers Central, the country's largest labor movement, called the work stoppage to protest banishment of its two top leaders involved in the last major protest strike in October 1987. That strike against the government of President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> failed to halt most activities in the country, but it ignited violence that left three people dead. The government said Monday it has taken `` all the necessary measures'' to maintain public order and `` guarantee the rights of those wanting to work.'' Interior Subsecretary <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> urged workers `` not to be afraid to go to work tomorrow.'' <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> did not elaborate on the anti-strike measures taken by authorities. In the past, the government has mobilized thousands of police and army troops during such protests. A series of mass protests shook the military government from 1983 to 1986, leaving at least 200 dead. The federation urged all the nation's workers to boycott work Tuesday and to keep their children home from school. A number of trade unions and a coalition of 17 opposition parties have said they will join the strike. Opposition politicians, however, have openly said they do not expect a significant work stoppage. The president of the opposition-controlled Workers Central, <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bustos </PERSON>, and vice president <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> were sentenced to internal exile in small provincial towns last year. They were charged with promoting violence and breaking state security law. The federation also is demanding an increase of the minimum wage from $ 55 to $ 100 a month. <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Olivares </PERSON>, acting president of the labor federation, said Monday the strike `` should be entirely peaceful,'' but some leftist groups are calling for street demonstrations in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> and other cities. Police said the demonstrations will not be allowed. Three bombs went off in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> on Sunday night, causing damage but no casualties. No one claimed responsibility, but police said they found pro-strike pamphlets nearby.

<HEAD>Suit Filed to Halt Base Closings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An organization representing federal employees filed suit Monday to prevent the closing of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases, charging that the law creating the federal commission that recommends base closings is unconstitutional. The lawsuit, filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said the Base Closure and Realignment Act violates the Constitution `` by improperly delegating the important legislative function of regulating the disposition of government property, to the unelected secretary of defense, and to the unelected members of the commission.'' The suit also said that the Constitution requires that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> provide for the nation's defense. The base closure law calls for the commission's recommendations to be accepted in their entirety and denies <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> the right to determine `` the logistical arrangements for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military forces in the 21st century,'' the suit said. The union represents 5,000 employees at <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Norton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Chanute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. All are scheduled to be closed. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approved legislation in October 1988 requiring the <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary to close and realign bases according to the panel's report. Two months later, the commission recommended closing 86 bases, partly closing five more and changing the mission of 54 others. Former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> approved the commission's report in January. The House is scheduled to vote Tuesday on a resolution to disapprove the base closing recommendations. Last month, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, by a vote of 43-4, supported the recommendations; the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is expected to do the same. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peirce </PERSON>, president of the union, said the commission based its decision on `` erroneous and out-of-date information. To put it simply, the commission blew it and it does n't appear as if the majority of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> gives a damn.'' The union is seeking a declaratory judgment from the courts on whether the Base Closure and Realignment Act is unconstitutional.

<HEAD>Italian Scientists Report Achieving Fusion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Experts and news reports said Monday that Italian scientists had created nuclear fusion at room temperature in a small container. Scientists at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alternative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> in Frascati, outside <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, measured neutrons being emitted from their experiment, said a scientist familiar with the work. `` They saw a lot of neutrons; that means fusion,'' said <PERSON> Francesco </PERSON> <PERSON> Celani </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physics </ORGANIZATION>, who worked with the Frascati group. The scientists were trying to copy an experiment by <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southampton </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION>, who announced last month they had achieved nuclear fusion in a glass beaker at room temperature. <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> claimed their experiment yielded four times the energy put into it. If they are correct, the result could be a relatively inexpensive energy source that is virtually inexhaustible. No scientists have managed to duplicate the energy burst reported in the experiment, however, and many experts believe the two scientists made a mistake. Several universities have said they confirmed parts of the Fleischmann-Pons experiment. Another researcher, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Brigham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, says he also created nuclear fusion but the energy output was virtually nil. <PERSON> Pierluigi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sani </PERSON>, public relations director of the Frascati agency, refused to confirm Italian media reports that scientists there had achieved fusion. A news conference has been scheduled for Tuesday, and `` officially we ca n't say anything until tomorrow,'' he said. <PERSON> Celani </PERSON> said the scientists at Frascati checked for neutrons but not energy emission. Fusion is the process powering the sun, in which tremendous amounts of energy are released when the cores of two hydrogen atoms fuse. By contrast, nuclear power plants get energy from fission, the splitting of atoms. Most scientists seeking a way to harness nuclear fusion have used extremely high temperatures and machines the size of houses to jam atoms together. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> used electrical current to herd hydrogen atoms into metal electrodes, where the hydrogen atoms apparently fused because of proximity. In the Frascati experiment, scientists forced hydrogen atoms into titanium and, according to <PERSON> Celani </PERSON>, lowered the temperature of the experiment to enhance fusion.

 Fugitive financier <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Vesco </PERSON> was added Monday as a defendant in a drug-conspiracy indictment, accused of persuading his Cuban hosts to allow cocaine-laden airplanes to fly over <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> en route to the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Vesco </PERSON>, a fugitive since the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> administration, was indicted on one count alleging he conspired to import cocaine into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Vesco </PERSON> is believed to have lived in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> since 1982, after bouncing around the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. He has been wanted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since 1973 on charges of looting an investment firm, <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Overseas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, of $ 224 million. The federal indictment charged that in October 1984, Colombian cocaine kingpin <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON> sent a messenger from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> asking <PERSON> Vesco </PERSON> to use his influence in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> to arrange for <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'s aircraft to fly over <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> on smuggling runs from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Andros </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>. A few days later, <PERSON> Vesco </PERSON>, `` in the presence of another individual'' supplied <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'s messenger with a document approving the cocaine overflights. The other person was not identified in the indictment. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> do n't have normal diplomatic relations or an extradition agreement. The Cuban government has denied playing host to <PERSON> Vesco </PERSON>. <PERSON> Vesco </PERSON>'s name was added as 15 other defendants, including <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'s former wife, faced arraignment in federal court in what prosecutors call the `` son of <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'' cocaine-conspiracy case. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> is believed to be one of the architects of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel, a Colombian drug-smuggling organization that is blamed for 80 percent of the cocaine smuggled into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>, 39, was convicted in May in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> of cocaine smuggling and operating a continuing criminal enterprise and is serving a life sentence plus 135 years in federal prison in <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION>, Ill. Most of those charged in the latest indictment, unsealed in March, were mentioned in testimony during <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'s trial. In addition, key members of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel also were indicted, as well as <PERSON> Everette </PERSON> <PERSON> Bannister </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> businessman and close associate of Bahamian Prime Minister <PERSON> Lynden </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bannister </PERSON> and the reputed leaders of the cartel _ <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaviria </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriquez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Mejia </PERSON> _ remained at large Monday. But 15 co-defendents, most of whom were freed on bail after their arrests in March, were ordered to appear before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON>. They included <PERSON> Yemel </PERSON> <PERSON> Nacel </PERSON>, who was once married to <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>. All 15 are accused of playing relatively minor roles in the drug dealing, some of which occurred as long as a decade ago. Ms. <PERSON> Nacel </PERSON>, who now lives in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, is accused only of helping count some of <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'s money in 1978 in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. Also facing new charges is <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, the co-defendant in <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'s trial who is serving a 15-year prison sentence <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> faces a possible life sentence if convicted of operating a continuing criminal enterprise.

 <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, saying nearly all of society's benefits flow from literacy, praised a young woman Monday who learned to read and broke free from the welfare cycle Addressing more than 3,000 volunteer leaders at a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Way </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> national </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> conference </ORGANIZATION>, the first lady said: `` You are at the heart of virtually every worthy cause there is.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> praised <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Way </LOCATION> for its help and funding of such organizations as <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts and causes as diverse as combatting child abuse and comforting young AIDS patients. Then, turning to the cause that has been the focus of her own volunteer leadership, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said as many as 25 percent of Americans struggle with literacy. `` Literacy is everybody's business,'' she said. `` The need for literacy is linked to every other important need in society ... housing, nutrition, health ... employment.'' To illustrate the point, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s address was followed by a videotape about <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Vega </PERSON>, a 29-year-old <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, resident and mother of three children, who broke 11 years of welfare dependence by learning to read and getting a job. Mrs. <PERSON> Vega </PERSON> dropped out of high school during her first pregnancy and was the third generation of her family to live on public assistance. The film showed her receiving reading lessons from <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Way </LOCATION> volunteer <PERSON> Paige </PERSON> <PERSON> Oristano </PERSON> and working as the assistant manager at a fast-food restaurant. After the film, Mrs. <PERSON> Vega </PERSON>, who since has become a <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Way </LOCATION> volunteer, read from a letter she had written Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to thank her for supporting literacy programs. `` It is hard and scary to get off welfare. You can not do it by yourself. People like me need someone out there to teach them how to make that dream come true because it is all new to them. ... I still feel scared,'' she said, her voice choking with tears. Mrs. <PERSON> Vega </PERSON> presented the first lady with a copy of the letter and the two women hugged briefly as the gathering rose to its feet and applauded. Overcome with emotion, Mrs. <PERSON> Vega </PERSON> kissed Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s cheek Later Monday, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> traveled to the <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> on the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>, where she officially opened an exhibit on the brain and learning disabilities. The permanent exhibit, called `` Learning and Learning Disabilties: Explorations of the Human Brain,'' is the first of its kind in the nation. ` This is truly an exhibit of hope,'' the first lady said. `` I applaud the museum for addressing this misunderstood subject in a public forum.'' The exhibit uses touch screens, video monitors, mannequins and giant brain models to show how the brain changes as it learns and how disabilties alter that process.

Thus <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> stood to lose its investment and expected profit from the operation of the oil fields. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> introduced <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Moncrief </PERSON> and other <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> principals to <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials, contacted Secretary of State <PERSON> Cyrus </PERSON> <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> and Egyptian Ambassador <PERSON> Ashraf </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghorbal </PERSON>, and personally delivered a letter to Egyptian President <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> while he was in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s intervention on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> Neptune </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> does not in itself appear to have violated any law or ethical standard. However, the facts of certain investment opportunities provided to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> by the <PERSON> Moncrief </PERSON> family at the same time he was intervening for <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> demonstrate that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> improperly received a gift valued at more than $ 100 from <PERSON> Monty </PERSON> <PERSON> Moncrief </PERSON>, a person with a direct interest in legislation before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. We were unable to establish with the required certainty that the gift was compensation for <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s intercession on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> Neptune </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> accepted the opportunity to purchase part of the <PERSON> Moncrief </PERSON> family interest in two east-Texas gas wells from <PERSON> Monty </PERSON> <PERSON> Moncrief </PERSON>, the late patriarch of the <PERSON> Moncrief </PERSON> family who was for many years active in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> as a lobbyist for the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The first opportunity, the <PERSON> Whatley </PERSON> well, appears to have been an ordinary, personal business transaction. For example, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> received a written offer to participate in drilling the well; accepted the offer by written commitment to pay his share of all drilling costs; obtained financing to pay for his drilling costs; and actually paid those costs all prior to the time gas was discovered in the well on July 11, 1979. Put another way, he risked the amount of the drilling costs against the chance that the well would be dry. Had the well been dry, the investment would have been lost. Once gas was discovered in the <LOCATION> Whatley </LOCATION> well, although it was commercially productive, it was clear that it would not be the investment predicted by the <ORGANIZATION> Moncriefs </ORGANIZATION>. Production and, therefore, profit from the well, if any, would be substantially less than had been anticipated. In contrast, in <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s second investment opportunity, the <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> No. 1 well, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> made no written commitment to pay drilling costs and did not obtain financing or pay for any costs until October 1979, long after gas was discovered in that well on June 27, 1979. Thus unlike the Whatley investment, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> invested in Williams No. 1 already knowing that it was a commercially successful well. The risk of losing his investment, which made <PERSON> Whatley </PERSON> an ordinary business transaction, was absent in Williams No. 1. Thus <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> received a gift worth aproximately $ 82,000 - $ 90,000, the difference between the drilling costs and the increased value of the well after gas was discovered <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> failed to disclose his receipt of this gift on his Financial Disclosure Statement for 1979. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> also deferred paying two <PERSON> Moncrief </PERSON> invoices for Williams No. 1 drilling costs without paying interest on the unpaid balance. One invoice for $ 8,668.21 remained unpaid from October 19, 1979 until September 4, 1980. A second invoice for $ 7,703.64 remained unpaid from April 18, 1980 until July 1, 1980. Although it appears that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> may have received interest-free loans from <PERSON> Monty </PERSON> <PERSON> Moncrief </PERSON> for $ 8,688.21 for 10 months and $ 7,703.64 for two months _ gifts worth nearly $ 1,200 _ it is impossible to determine whether <PERSON> Moncrief </PERSON>'s failures to collect the overdue balances were intended as gifts, or were merely bookkeeping oversights. Thus we can not conclude with the required certainty that <PERSON> Moncrief </PERSON>'s failures to collect interest were gifts to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. In 1984, at a time when the <PERSON> Whatley </PERSON> well was `` shut in'' i.e., had temporarily ceased production, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Monty </PERSON> <PERSON> Moncrief </PERSON> to buy back his interest in the well. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was receiving no income from the well and consequently he made no payments on his loan from <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. The bank's chairman stated that under those circumstances he would have required other arrangements for repayment of the nearly $ 20,000 outstanding balance. <PERSON> Monty </PERSON> <PERSON> Moncrief </PERSON> agreed to buy back the <PERSON> Whatley </PERSON> interest for $ 20,000. While <PERSON> Moncrief </PERSON>'s repurchase of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s interest in the <PERSON> Whatley </PERSON> well appears to have been a favor to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, it also appears to have been purchased at about the market value of the interest. Therefore, there was no gift to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>.

 A $ 42 million drilling platform that capsized in heavy seas off <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> 10 days ago drifted more than 280 miles to the northeast before finally sinking off <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, officials said Monday. The 27,500-ton structure sank shortly before 1 a.m. Sunday about 62 miles east of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lookout </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Chief Warrant Officer <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. The platform was being towed from <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Gloucester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, for a pipeline project when it capsized April 7. No one was aboard it. The platform, known as a jack-up rig, was used for exploratory drilling and other underwater projects. Authorities are not sure why it overturned, but <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said heavy seas contributed. The Coast Guard is investigating. After the platform capsized, it slowly sank, drifting northeast with the Gulf Stream, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. A tug stayed with the rig to make sure no ships ran into it, he said. An estimated 500 gallons of oil, hydraulic oil and diesel fuel were aboard the platform, but officials do n't feel that presents a major environmental threat because the platform sank well off the coast, in water 1 -LCB- miles deep, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. The platform, owned by <ORGANIZATION> Maitland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Littlestown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, was built in 1978 by <ORGANIZATION> Bethleham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> for $ 42 million, said company spokesman <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Man Charged With Killing 18 Elderly Women Dies of AIDS</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A man who confessed to the serial murders of 18 elderly <LOCATION> Parisian </LOCATION> women died Monday of AIDS while awaiting trial, prison officials said. <PERSON> Thierry </PERSON> <PERSON> Paulin </PERSON>, a 26-year-old native of <LOCATION> Martinique </LOCATION>, was arrested Dec. 1, 1987, after a three-year manhunt for the killer of a large group of elderly women between October 1984 and January 1986. The women all were between 60 and 83 years of age, and nearly all were strangled, stabbed or smothered in their homes after being severely beaten. <PERSON> Paulin </PERSON> told police that he stalked the women and forced his way into their homes. <PERSON> Paulin </PERSON> had a record of arrests for thefts and drugs, but police said the killings did not seem to be linked exclusively to money. They said that during the interrogation, <PERSON> Paulin </PERSON> `` had trouble distinguishing between all the attacks he had committed.'' <PERSON> Paulin </PERSON>'s fingerprints were found in the homes of at least seven murder victims, police said at the time. Prison authorities, who declined to be identified in keeping with prison policy, said <PERSON> Paulin </PERSON> tested positive for AIDS in 1986 and last year began suffering symptoms of the disease that attacks and destroys the body's immune system. <PERSON> Paulin </PERSON> fell into a coma several days ago and was admitted to the intensive care unit of <LOCATION> Fresnes </LOCATION> prison hospital over the weekend. He died early Monday, authorities said without providing any other details. Before his death, <PERSON> Paulin </PERSON> blamed several of the murders on his accomplice, <PERSON> Jean-Thierry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathuin </PERSON>, who was arrested shortly after <PERSON> Paulin </PERSON> and remains in custody. AIDS is most often transmitted through sexual contact. Other means of transmission include transfusions of tainted blood or blood products, and the sharing of contaminated hypodermic needles or syringes by drug abusers.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> canceled two negotiating sessions, saying Monday that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s arrest of a dissident who visited the communist nation was part of a plan to undermine efforts for better relations. Two letters from <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> called off talks set for Tuesday on a possible joint team for the 1990 Asian Games in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, and an April 26 session on arranging a meeting of the two prime ministers. The action appeared to threaten future negotiations between <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> on easing their bitter rivalry in a land divided since World War II. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> proposed the talks resume in July, but <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> officials said continuing the dialogue would have to be considered. They spoke on condition of anonymity. Both messages from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> were delivered at <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION>, the truce village at the border, and released by the government of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. They criticized <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> for arresting the Rev. <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ik-hwan </PERSON> for his visit last month to <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>, where he discussed reunification of the peninsula with President <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON>. <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> was arrested Thursday on his return to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> via <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, and charged with aiding anti-state groups and making an illegal visit to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. About 10,000 war veterans and supporters, shouting anti-communist slogans, demonstrated Monday in <LOCATION> Puchon </LOCATION>, about 12 miles west of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, denouncing <PERSON> Moon </PERSON>'s trip and `` leftists trying to destroy freedom and peace through revolution,'' according to the South Korean news agency <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION>. Thousands of radical students in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and elsewhere fought riot police or rallied to demand <PERSON> Moon </PERSON>'s release, <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> said. No injuries or arrests were reported. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Moon </PERSON>'s arrest proved <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> did not want to improve relations. It is illegal for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> to visit <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> without government permission. <PERSON> Paik </PERSON> <PERSON> Nam </PERSON> <PERSON> Jun </PERSON>, a senior North Korean official, said in the letter suspending political talks that the charge against <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> of dealing with an `` anti-state organization'' could only refer to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. As a result, he said, `` the smooth conduct of the north-south talks has been made impossible.'' <PERSON> Paik </PERSON> said <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> hoped the `` atmosphere would improve'' and meetings could resume in July. The two nations have tried to improve relations through a series of talks that began in 1988, but with little success. When <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> government cracked down on dissidents and said <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> wanted to help <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> seize control of the entire peninsula. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> says talks with the North may be conducted only by the government. Dissidents in the South have held violent protests demanding the downfall of <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s government, but they have little public support and <PERSON> Moon </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> appears to have damaged their cause. Many South Koreans who fear <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> were infuriated by the visit. Television showed <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> embracing <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>, who ordered the 1950 invasion that started the Korean War. The two Koreas technically remain at war because no peace treaty was signed after the war ended in 1953. In other Korean developments Monday: _ <ORGANIZATION> Daewoo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a joint venture between the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Daewoo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, halted production in response to a wave of strikes by workers seeking higher wages Similar walkouts forced carmakers <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Kia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to stop production last week. Officials said the job actions threaten <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s economy. Also Monday, 5,000 taxi drivers threatened to strike for higher wages and improved working conditions. _ Eight senior lawmakers of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s second largest opposition party, the <ORGANIZATION> Reunification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> led by <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON>, offered to resign over a scandal involving a party lawmaker who bribed a rival candidate to drop out of a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> election It was not clear if <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> would accept the resignations.

 Local television in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> reported 14 people are missing after last week's deadly clash between troops and pro-independence demonstrators, an official at the Georgian news agency said Monday. <PERSON> Zurab </PERSON> <PERSON> Lomidze </PERSON>, deputy director of <LOCATION> Gruzinform </LOCATION>, also said a midnight-5 a.m. curfew is being lifted Tuesday morning, and soldiers and tanks that have occupied the Georgian capital for 11 days will begin leaving. Residents of <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> have said 100 people disappeared after the bloody clash April 9 and that many of them were killed in addition to the 19 in the official death toll. Radio <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> said 20 were killed. <PERSON> Rolad </PERSON> <PERSON> Beridze </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Georgian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> denied reports of a higher death toll, but he acknowledged that one of the 19 victims had been shot. He said soldiers fired on a car violating the first night of curfew on April 9, killing one man and wounding two companions. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, visiting <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said authorities overreacted to the Georgian protest. He also told Channel 4 television, `` And the authorities, they accepted the blame and the secretary of the party of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> stepped down, the prime minister stepped down and president stepped down. So they all accepted their responsibility.'' <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> residents dispute official reports that soldiers were ordered to clear the square because the demonstrators were threatening to seize power from the government. One resident branded as `` an outrageous lie'' an official statement that protesters were killed in an panicked crush. `` There was no crush of people, there were no extremist slogans,'' said resident <PERSON> Lasha </PERSON> <PERSON> Tabukashvili </PERSON>. Witnesses say the troops attacked a peaceful crowd with clubs, shovels and poison gas, chasing down fleeing women and teens to beat them to death. `` It's a cover-up,'' charged <PERSON> Naira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gipashvili </PERSON>, who also was interviewed by telephone. Foreign correspondents remain barred from the republic. <PERSON> Gipashvili </PERSON> noted that the Georgian health minister said on local television that many people were injured by the poison gas. Activists and <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> residents said a number of people died from poison gas, but the national media have said nothing about chemical attacks. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, a Georgian who has been leading the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> delegation to <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>, said on national television Monday night that officials decided to lift the curfew after a series of meetings Sunday. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said enforcing a curfew on a Soviet city `` is not a mission for the Soviet army.'' Three Georgian activists, two of them leaders of a committee calling for a general strike in <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>, have been arrested, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> activist <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Podrabinek </PERSON> said Monday. <PERSON> Podrabinek </PERSON>, the editor of the dissident journal Express-Khronika, identified the three as <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bardavelidze </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ucha </PERSON> <PERSON> Dzidzava </PERSON>, both students and leaders of a strike committee, and <PERSON> Irakli </PERSON> <PERSON> Batryashvili </PERSON>, member of one of the informal groups that organized the initial pro-independence demonstration. Demonstrations in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> first began April 4 when protesters criticized calls from members of the republic's ethnic Abkhazian minority to break away because of alleged discrimination by Georgians. Other protesters have demanded <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> secede from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> because of alleged interference from the central government. In the Baltic republic of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, about 30,000 people rallied Sunday for three hours in the city of <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION> to mourn the victims in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Valdas </PERSON> <PERSON> Anelauskas </PERSON>, a local journalist for Express-Khronika. No arrests or violence were reported.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>, a nation smaller than the state of <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, marks its 150th anniversary Tuesday determined to survive among the great powers that spawned its independence. A speck on the world map _ tucked between <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> - the grand duchy has used its position on the crossroads of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s main cultures to maintain one of the highest standards of living in the world. `` Do n't mix us up with countries that are even smaller than ours,'' said <PERSON> Lex </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, a government spokesman. <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>, with a population of 372,000, became independent of the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> under the 1839 Treaty of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> signed by the European powers. Since then its fate has been determined by close cooperation with its neighbors _ an inevitable option for a nation that covers only 999 square miles. <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> is 1,214 square miles. `` It is essential a small state like us can survive and develop by keeping its independence only within great frameworks,'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Santer </PERSON>, who heads a center-left coalition government, said recently. <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> is a founding member of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and an ardent member of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>. It is home for a number of <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> institutions, including the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> license plates display the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> flag of 12 gold stars in a field of royal blue. Tuesday's independence celebrations will be attended by foreign dignitaries from many nations, including <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. In recent decades, <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> has become a financial center. The city of <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>, with a population of 75,000, has more than 100 banks from around the world and the banking industry employs 10 percent of the work force and accounts for a quarter of the national income. The financial institutions have helped keep unemployment at about 1.5 percent, by far the lowest in the 12-nation EEC. Immigrants account for 27 percent of the population, the highest in the EEC. Problems involving immigrants do exist, <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> said, but without the violence that mars coexistence in many other European nations. Although they have no voting rights, `` our <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> and Italian fellow citizens have all the same social rights as Luxembourgers,'' he said. To improve integration, a relaxed naturalization process in recent years has made it easier for immigrants to gain citizenship. Language poses a problem for foreigners from southern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> said. Most Luxembourgers speak German and French along with <PERSON> Luxembourgish </PERSON>, a German dialect. But <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> added: `` We're a good blend. The French are more impulsive, the Germans more heavy-handed,'' giving Luxembourgers balance and patience.

 A man convicted of slaying six people at a shopping center wept as relatives testifying at his sentencing described how he cared for his mother and ailing wife.

The jury that found him guilty must recommend to Circuit Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Antoon </PERSON> whether <PERSON> Cruse </PERSON> should be sentenced to death or life in prison. <PERSON> Cruse </PERSON> cried when his niece, <PERSON> Rebbeca </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, told jurors that he doted on his wife, who had Parkinson's disease `` He was always there for her,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. `` They never had children, but they had each other.'' She said her uncle visited his mother every day in a nursing home until her death in 1980. <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruse </PERSON>, widow of the convicted man's brother, said the defendant `` took good care of his mother.

Earlier, Assistant State Attorney <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> said <PERSON> Cruse </PERSON> should be put to death because he committed the murders in a `` cold, calculated, premeditated fashion.'' But Assistant Public Defender <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Arlt </PERSON> said witnesses would show <PERSON> Cruse </PERSON> was severely mentally disturbed at the time of the crime, had a reduced capacity to realize the consequences of his actions, did not realize he had hurt anyone and that his mental condition was aggravated by alcohol.

The possible exercise of undue influence in dealing with officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. On July 26, 1988, the committee appointed a Special Outside Counsel -LRB- hereinafter also referred to as `` Counsel'' -RRB-, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>, to conduct the Preliminary Inquiry. The appointment was made to assure that the investigation would not be subject to claims that the matter was not handled in a fair and objective manner. In addition, the committee received sworn testimony from Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> on September 14, 1988, regarding the areas under investigation. At the time of his appearance, Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, who was accompanied by his counsel, also responded to questions asked by members of the committee. Because the committee did not complete the Preliminary Inquiry prior to the end of the 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the investigation was reauthorized for completion by the committee at its first meeting of the 101st <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on January 4, 1989. During the course of the Preliminary Inquiry, the Special Outside Counsel and his staff obtained the sworn testimony of over 70 witnesses and examined thousands of documents. Based upon the information obtained, Mr. <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> submitted a Report to the Committee on February 21, 1989, containing counsel's legal and factual findings. Subsequent to submission of the Special Outside Counsel's Report, the committee began a three-phase decisionmaking process First, the committee committed one full week, which was designated as a `` reading period'' to allow all committee members to read counsel's report and supporting materials. In the second phase, the committee received an extensive oral presentation by the Special Outside Counsel and his staff and then by counsel for Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, who were accorded an opportunity to hear and respond to the Special Outside Counsel's presentation. During the second phase, questions were asked of both counsel in order to obtain the greatest perspective on the matters addressed during the Preliminary Inquiry as well as to put to rest any concern that Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> had been denied a full and fair opportunity to respond to the Special Outside Counsel's findings, particularly where improper conduct was believed possibly to have occurred. Immediately upon the conclusion of the oral presentations, the committee commenced phase three, deliberations on the matters it had received. The committee has completed its three-phase review process and is today announcing the decisions made in the matter of the Preliminary Inquiry regarding Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. First, at the beginning of its deliberations, the committee decided that it would release the complete text of the Report of the Special Outside Counsel simultaneous with any Statement of Alleged Violation if such a statement was to be issued in connection with the subject case. Under Rule 11 -LRB- b -RRB- of the committee's Rules of Procedure, a Statement of Alleged Violation may be issued if the committee determines there is `` reason to believe that the violation occurred.'' Should such an alleged violation become the subject of a disciplinary hearing, under Rule 16 -LRB- e -RRB-, the committee staff has the burden of proof to establish `` clearly and convincingly by the evidence'' that fact of a violation. Second, the committee decided that, in the event it determined not to take action on matters addressed in the Special Outside Counsel's Report, it would make public its views on why no further action was being taken in order to avoid any claim that a matter not pursued was `` ignored'' as opposed to having been the subject of full committee consideration. ... The discussion that follows is presented in the order in which specific areas of investigation were identified in the committee's June 9, 1988, Resolution of Preliminary Inquiry As appropriate, the discussion will either explain why the committee determined no further action should be taken or why a Statement of Alleged Violation is being issued, along with the complete text of the Statement of Alleged Violation. In this regard, the committee emphasizes that while the following discussion presents those actions taken, it is not intended either to set forth all of the facts or information obtained by the Special Outside Counsel or to be viewed as a substitute for the detailed analysis contained in counsel's February 21, 1989, report. Individuals desirous of all relevant facts should consult the counsel's report which is being made publicly available with this committee statement.

<TEXT>
 Drug czar <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> emerged Monday from a meeting with officials from metropolitan <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> _ but not Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> _ saying he found `` good will on their part'' to help his plan to combat drug abuse and related violence in the area. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, whose administration was attacked by <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> a week ago as having `` failed to serve its citizens,'' did not attend the meeting because he was testifying before a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> asked the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> panel to assign 500 federal police officers to aid the drug fight. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s meeting Monday was marked by confusion among local officials about what the plan meant, if the war on drugs would end at the District boundary line and whether they would get stuck with a new prison for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> criminals. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s office invited the mayors of 11 local cities and eight counties as well as the governors of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. The mayors and county officials who attended the hourlong meeting told reporters afterward they were pleased their areas would be included for intelligence gathering and law enforcement efforts by a new task force, but <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Curt </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmoke </PERSON> said, `` There were still many more questions than answers today ... `` What I got from my understanding today was that this plan is evolving, that this is just the first phase, and that's why we're still in a situation where there are still a lot of questions on our minds,'' <PERSON> Schmoke </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s criticism of and estrangement from <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> has brought up questions about whether they can work together to combat the drug problem that has made <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> the nation's murder capital. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said Monday that he had not spoken directly with <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> since the plan for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was announced a week earlier, but said he had invited the mayor to attend the meeting and he urged reporters to drop the issue. `` We are not in the process of developing a relationship; we are trying to respond to the drug problem,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. `` This issue about whether <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> and I will stand up in public and put our arms around each other is not the issue, and you ought to get off it.'' Civil rights activist <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who met with <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> later in the day, said, `` The issue is not <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>. It is drug-pushing terrorists against a civilized society. My sense is that <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> is not feuding with Mr. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>. Mr. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> certainly is not feuding with Mr. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>.'' On Sunday, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had toured <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and played some basketball with <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> and had criticized <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s plan for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, saying it was too limited in scope. But there was no public criticism of <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> on Monday. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> selected <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as a `` test case'' for the drug war and has said he plans to use what he learns from the various approaches tried here to help him compile the national drug control strategy, which is due in another 4 -LCB- months. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> became the nation's murder capital last year with 372 murders, most of them drug-related. So far this year, there have been 145 slayings, compared with 96 at the same time in 1988. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s plan, among other things, called for creation of a metropolitan area task force of law enforcement agents with of 57 more federal officials, construction of the pretrial detention facility and a 700-bed federal prison. Among the questions still open was the location of a 500-bed pretrial detention facility. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> praised the officials who attended the meeting Monday for their understanding that `` with positions of responsibility come responsibilities to act on certain things.'' But he criticized the `` not-in-my-back-yard'' attitude many people have about prisons. `` Everybody wants to wage the war on drugs, but there are fewer volunteers for the building of prisons,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. `` We may not want prisons in our county or in our part of the state, but in some areas the choice may be between having the bad guys in the back yard or the prison in the back yard.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said the purpose of Monday's meeting `` was to inform the good, local, responsible officials of a little more detail'' on the plan. `` I want to stress the degree of good will on their part, they are interested, they're on board, they want to see this problem solved.''

<HEAD>Sanguinetti Says Referendum Settles Amnesty Question</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED McCULLOUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanguinetti </PERSON> said Monday the question of amnesty for human rights abuses under military rule has been settled by voter approval of the amnesty law his government passed in 1986. With 7,037 of 7,072 districts reporting in Sunday's referendum, the vote was 1,013,554 for amnesty, or 52.62 percent, and 771,942 _ 40.08 percent _ who wanted the law discarded. <PERSON> Sanguinetti </PERSON>, a 52-year-old lawyer, told reporters Monday: `` Now the discussion has ended.'' When asked whether his government would consider a compromise with opponents of amnesty, since they got nearly 41 percent of the vote, he replied: `` They were the ones who chose this way. They were the ones who submitted the law to a majority vote. ... National peace is to accept the verdict of the ballot box.'' Blank or invalid ballots, and others classed as questionable that may or may not be counted, totaled 140,703, or 7.3 percent of the votes cast. About 85 percent of eligible voters participated. The amnesty law forbids prosecution of about 180 soldiers and police accused of torture, murder and other crimes in 1973-85, when the military ruled <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> and conducted what it called a war on leftist subversion. It was passed by the new civilian government in December 1986, after officers made clear they would not answer charges in the courts. Three military uprisings have occurred in neighboring <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> during the past two years because of the same issue. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> returned to civilian government in 1983 after nearly eight years of military rule and has tried many officers, including former junta members. Uruguayans voted on amnesty because the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> for a Referendum gathered 634,000 petition signatures during 1987, more than the required 25 percent of registered voters. <PERSON> Sanguinetti </PERSON> said his goal was to consolidate democracy in this nation of 3 million people, which was an example of representative government to <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> before 1973, and `` in this case, peace is justice.'' He told the news conference amnesty does not excuse or justify military abuses, which included the executions of about 150 Uruguayans, arrests and disappearances of 200 more and the torture of several thousand. It must be remembered, he said, that military intervention followed years of terrorism and economic chaos. <PERSON> Sanguinetti </PERSON> said leftist Tupamaro guerrillas were released from prison in 1985 and the military amnesty `` is on the same line.'' `` There is no sense of triumph'' in the referendum's result, he said, and added: `` The most important aspect in all this is that the country was able to do it'' by popular vote. `` Yesterday at 7:30 p.m., when the ballot boxes were closed, <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> completed its transition'' to democracy. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> for a Referendum, and the human rights and leftist political groups that supported the referendum, apparently accepted the outcome. Only the small <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said the vote was not fair, claiming the government intimidated voters by hinting of trouble if the amnesty was overturned. <PERSON> Matilde </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Larreta </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON>, co-president of the referendum commission, said: `` in accordance with the results of the referendum, the amnesty has been confirmed. Without doubt, the decision of the electorate should be accepted.''

<HEAD>Another Eastern Jet Seized With Cocaine</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 One of the relatively few <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jets flying since the beginning of a strike against the carrier was seized Monday by Customs after inspectors found 75 pounds of cocaine in a mail bag in the cargo hold. It was the 14th seizure of cocaine on an Eastern plane since September, and eight of those shipments were found in the mail, or courier, bags. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 seized Monday landed in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> after a flight from <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>, that stopped in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, said Customs spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON>. Customs imposed a $ 1.2 million fine on Eastern and demanded a letter of credit from the strike-hobbled airline before releasing the plane. `` We hate to kick an airline while it's down, but we will not allow illegal drugs into the country,'' <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> said. Because of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s financial problems, Customs has decided to cash in three previous credit letters worth about $ 3 million, he said. The letters are usually held until Customs and the airline negotiate an agreement on the fine. Eastern spokeswoman <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON> said Customs will have to go to bankruptcy court to get its money. `` We do n't think that fining airlines and seizing their aircraft is the way to stop drug trafficking,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON>. She said the airline spent $ 3 million on security last year, an amount that was not decreased this year even though <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> has had to severely shrink its schedule following the March 4 Machinists' strike that was supported by pilots and flight attendants But <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> said Eastern apparently was n't doing the job, even though smugglers were using the same method time after time. `` Due to the fact that over half of the seizure have been in courier bags, we find it difficult to understand why courier bags do not receive extra attention,'' <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> said. `` There should n't be a courier bag on <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> that is n't gone over with a fine-toothed comb. The bright blue and green bag, of a type used to carry mail, was found during a routine inspection Monday by the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contraband </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Team </ORGANIZATION>. It was not on the plane manifest, and authorities did not know where it was put aboard the plane. No destination was listed on the bag, suggesting that someone planned to remove it from the cargo hold in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, eight men who were Eastern baggage handlers at the time of their 1986 indictment went on trial Monday in a smuggling scheme. They are charged with conspiracy to import cocaine and conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute.

<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said Monday that the fierce combat that broke out in northern <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> at the outset of the independence process has created severe logistical problems for the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> monitoring force. <PERSON> Cedric </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornberry </PERSON>, second-in-command of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> contingent that is to oversee <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s transition to independence, said <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> personnel had planned to use vacated South African military facilities. But because of clashes between security forces and guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, South African troop withdrawal has been delayed, he said. This has created `` enormous competition'' for accommodation and other facilities in the relatively underdeveloped northern region of Ovambo. <PERSON> Thornberry </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> planned to start deploying police monitors in <LOCATION> Ovambo </LOCATION> this week who will check actions of the South African-led territorial police force. But he said it was hard to find offices for monitors that were easily accessible to civilians who might want to file complaints. The world body has urged civilians to report allegations of harassment or intimidation by the security forces or <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> supporters. At <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Secretary <PERSON> Theo-Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Gurirab </PERSON> said Monday that Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> should visit <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> to restore public confidence in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gurirab </PERSON> said a visit by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief would help restore the `` tarnished'' image of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in the eyes of Namibians. He blamed the world organization for not stationing <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeepers in northern <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> by April 1, the day a cease-fire was supposed to take effect at the start of a yearlong transition to independence but instead the day that <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas fought gun battles with South African-led security forces. Territorial officials say 278 guerrillas and 27 security force members have been killed and 28 guerrillas captured. <PERSON> Thornberry </PERSON> said 2,662 members of the planned 4,650-member <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> military force were in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> by Monday, with 410 Kenyan infantrymen due by Tuesday. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> said about 1,600 guerrillas crossed the border from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> in violation of an agreement that they stay at bases at least 100 miles inside <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. Up to 380 guerrillas returned to <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> after withdrawal orders from their exiled leader, and about 900 remain in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> offficials say. As of Monday, only seven guerrillas reported to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> checkpoints established as part of a plan to give guerrillas safe passage back to <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. The others who withdrew did so on their own. Officials expressed doubt that guerrillas would venture near the assembly points because of the heavy concentration of police and soldiers around each area. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has ruled <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> since World War I. In December, it agreed to allow independence in exchange for <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s withdrawing its estimated 50,000 troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> has fought South African rule since 1966 and is favored to get the most votes in pre-independence elections scheduled for November.

 Similarly, when <PERSON> Moncrief </PERSON> agreed in June 1984 to take a `` farm out'' from <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s interest in the drilling of a second <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> well -LRB- i.e., a buy-out of most of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s interest in the well -RRB-, the terms of the `` farm out'' were in accordance with industry custom and the price was at or near market value. Thus there was no gift to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>; nor can either the repurchase or the `` farm out,'' which both took place in 1984, reasonably be viewed as compenation to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> for his efforts on <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s behalf in 1979.

 In September 1979, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> co-signed a letter to Secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON>, on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- `` TXO'' -RRB-.

As discussed in Section III. A. of this Report, from February 1979 until March 1984 <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> held an interest in the <LOCATION> Whatley </LOCATION> well, an east-Texas natural gas well drilled and operated by TXO. However, as an investor in the well, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s financial return was determined only by the productivity of the well and could not have been affected by <ORGANIZATION> TXO </ORGANIZATION>'s success or failure with respect to the <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> leases. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s letter did not comment upon the merits of the dispute between TXO and <ORGANIZATION> Arkla </ORGANIZATION>. Therefore, it is not a prohibited ex parte communication under the Government in the Sunshine Act, Pub. L. 94-409, 4, Stat. 1241, 1246, 5 U.S.C. 557 -LRB- d -RRB-. The letter was the only communication on the subject between <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> or his staff and <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> or his staff. Therefore, the letter was not an exercise of undue influence by <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. Furthermore, <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> and undersecretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> both stated that the letter made no demand or request that they deemed unusual or improper. Nor did the letter affect the decision made by the department with respect to the leases. As discussed in full in Section III.

 In early 1984, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and his close friend <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> discussed producing a book of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s earlier speeches, poems and writings which <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> testified would be sold at low cost to a very broad audience including college students and `` average citizens.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> he wanted to give people an idea of what his personal feelings were on a number of subjects so that they could get to know the Majority Leader and next Speaker of the House. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> also discussed the book with his staff. <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Cossolotto </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s congressional staff researcher and speech writer, testified that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> first raised the subject of the book at a staff breakfast in February 1984. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> asked the staff to think about ways to market the book and suggested that when he gave a speech to a trade association or other group, he could sell the group books instead of taking an honorarium. Cossolotto testified that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> explained to the staff that unlike honoraria, book royalties are exempt from the 30 percent maximum limit on outside earned income. Throughout 1984, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> had members of his staff collecting his old speeches and compiling, editing, typing and proofreading the manuscript for his book. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s staff obtained celebrity endorsements of the book for the back cover and selected a photograph of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> for the front cover. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> formed the <ORGANIZATION> Madison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> company in 1984 as a division of <ORGANIZATION> Madison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s political consulting firm, for the purpose of publishing <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s book, `` Reflections of a Public Man.'' However, <PERSON> Madison </PERSON> <PERSON> Publishing </PERSON> did not `` publish'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s book. Nor has it published any other book. Madison Publishing designed the layout and printed the cover for <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s book. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> sent the book itself to be printed and assembled by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Printing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> because, as he testified, <ORGANIZATION> Madison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> did not have the capacity to print 20,000 copies. The Printing Center actually printed 19,068 books and reduced the charge to Madison Publishing accordingly. The final product was completed in early December 1984 and delivered in two installments on December 6 and 18, 1984. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> himself applied for and secured copyright protection for the book and hired a <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> real estate attorney to draft a `` royalty'' agreement between <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Madison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> supplied the attorney with specific provisions to be included in the agreement including the provisions for a 55 percent `` royalty.'' The agreement was executed on December 12, 1984, after 2,160 copies of the completed books had already been delivered to <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>.

 Public airing of the ethics committee report on <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> provides his opponents with reams of political ammunition, but does not in itself strike a fatal blow. Democrats must move to quickly mold public opinion if the speaker is going to keep his leadership post, and <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s allies say having the facts on the table can help. The Committee on Standards of Official Conduct released a voluminous report by its special counsel and charged the speaker with 69 instances of violating House rules. The report provides sometimes embarrassing details of the financial benefits he received from friendships with two <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> businessmen. One, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, gave <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> unusually high royalties he published the speaker's book, `` Reflections of a Public Man.'' With fifty-five cents of every dollar going to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, the committee said it appeared that the speaker was using bulk sales of the paperback to evade <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> limits on outside income from speeches. The second friend, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>, had a business partnership with the speaker. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON>, benefited from the free use of a condominium and a car, and an $ 18,000 annual salary to Mrs. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. House members are looking at the committee report on two political levels: within the institution and in their home districts. Within the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, release of the report Monday caused members to begin focusing on their own situations. `` We have to deal with it on a very specific level,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Frost </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, a <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> ally who contends lawmakers will make independent judgments despite pressure at home. `` I think members do n't want to be stampeded on this, one way or another,'' he said. <PERSON> Frost </PERSON> said members confronted with the committee's findings will find them troubling because of their broad implications. For example, it decided that <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> had an interest in legislation using a standard so broad that anyone with wealth would fall in the same category, he contended, a situation that could snare many lawmakers. `` I think members will look at this in a serious way and say, ` Is this fair?''' he said. Outside of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, Democrats must persuade the public that the violations <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> is accused of are mostly technical and not really unethical. They ca n't afford to wait for the committee to render a verdict on whether <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> should be found guilty and punished. The initial rush of publicity was seen by virtually everyone as negative for <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, but <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders argued that as they rebut the specific charges the public will come to believe that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> is being held to an unjust standard. Rep. <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said that `` once people clearly understand ... then you get an entirely different feel and reaction.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> himself must also be convincing. `` If the speaker is well received in the country, and what he says is resonant with the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public, he improves his chances,'' said Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Spratt </PERSON>, D-S.C. Further, the report itself is not a conviction. That could only be done by the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and even if that were to occur, it would be up to the Democrats who elected him to decide whether <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has become an unsupportable political liability. With few exceptions, Republicans greeted the release with sounds of deference and respect to the process set up to investigate a fellow member. Despite the fact that the campaign to investigate <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s finances was kicked off by one of their own, Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, the Republicans tried to portray themselves as above the fray. A key element in their strategy to wrest control of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> away from the <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> is to portray the <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> as the party of corruption and themselves as its enemy. `` The best politics for Republicans is no evidence of politics at all,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>. Some Democrats scoffed at the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> tactic. It was `` bipartisan, non-partisan garbage,'' said Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Traficant </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>. `` Let there be no mistake, today in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> the party lines are being drawn in indelible ink.'' The verdict on <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> from the ethics committee may be technical and not so clear as the party lines. But when that comes, some weeks down the road, the public verdict may have already come in. `` We'll be opening our own mail for a while,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, D-Mont.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> on Monday urged Poles to rebuild Solidarity `` skillfully and quickly'' hours after a court declared the independent union legal again and ended seven years of government suppression. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> also praised President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for announcing an aid package for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s economy. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> was expected to follow up restoration of his union's legal status with a meeting Tuesday with his longtime antagonist, Polish leader Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, and a trip to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> on Wednesday to meet Polish-born Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> at the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> Looking relaxed despite what he said was a case of pneumonia, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> arrived by train in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> on Monday night and told reporters <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was `` a brilliant politician.'' `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is a great man and he knows the Polish situation very well,'' he said. He called the proposal for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid `` quite big.'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> was accompanied to <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> by key adviser <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Michnik </PERSON> and was welcomed at the station by a handful of other Solidarity advisers. He said he could not confirm or deny he had a planned meeting with <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>. `` I appeal to all workers and supporters of our union to form factory organizations as soon as possible where they still do n't exist and to report their membership in Solidarity or to join it,'' said <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, in a statement read in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> by union spokesman <PERSON> Janusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON> <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON> said an independent union press should begin operating by the end of the month and that Solidarity should get new national headquarters in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> by Tuesday. `` Our effort, devotion and suffering have not been in vain,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said in his statement. `` We defended our workers' rights, together we are paving a road to a fully democratic and sovereign <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>.'' But he cautioned the `` day of success'' came in hard economic times. `` The Polish nation is facing tasks which are much more complex than in 1980. Now we must undertake a trial of real and deep economic reform and democratic restructuring of the state,'' he said. The <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> provincial court registered the reborn Solidarity in the same room where its original charter was approved in November 1980. <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON> said <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> stayed away from the hearing in part because the union always regarded itself as legal, so the session had `` a technical rather than symbolic nature.'' Nevertheless, there was thunderous applause when the verdict was complete, sealing an about-face approved earlier by <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders. As the court session ended, hundreds of hands lifted in the `` V'' for victory sign and chants of `` Solidarnosc! Solidarnosc!'' filled the room. Solidarity leaders beamed, supporters waved bouquets of yellow daffodils, and judges shook hands with the participants. Then there were cheers of `` <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>! <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>!'' and the singing of the national anthem. `` The spirit of history was with us,'' said Solidarity supporter <PERSON> Krzysztof </PERSON> <PERSON> Sliwinski </PERSON>. Two Solidarity banners were held aloft during the hearing before Presiding Judge <PERSON> Danuta </PERSON> <PERSON> Widawska </PERSON> and two other judges. About a dozen Solidarity leaders and advisers and 300 sympathizers jammed the narrow courtroom with yellow walls and crimson curtains. Another 100 waited in the corridor. `` Polish society puts enormous hopes in the honest operation of all trade unions in the area of the rights and interests of the working people and the realization of their material and cultural needs,'' Ms. <PERSON> Widawska </PERSON> said after the verdict, in which she registered Solidarity as a legal trade union. <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> tried to dissolve Solidarity in a December 1981 martial-law crackdown, but now seeks the movement's help to pull <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> out of economic crisis. Party and government officials also admit that by legalizing the union they hope to encourage the West to provide economic help to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, burdened by a $ 38 billion foreign debt. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Monday announced an aid package to help <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s economy. He told a Polish-American crowd in <LOCATION> Hamtramck </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, that continued aid would depend on consistent moves by the communist government toward reform. The concessions could open the way for up to $ 1 billion in new loans, loan rescheduling and trade and investment relief, according to administration and international monetary sources. The last step in the long bid for restoration of Solidarity followed unprecedented negotiations between communist authorities and opposition representatives led by <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>. The talks reached accords on legalizing Solidarity, creating the first freely elected legislative chamber in the Soviet bloc and other economic and political reforms. Solidarity members, who predict the union will grow to 5 million to 7 million members and hold its first congress later this year, face the tasks of organizing the union and the election campaign. The movement was 10 million strong and so popular it threatened to topple the communists' monopoly on power when martial law was imposed. Although thousands of its activists including <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> were locked up, the union continued to function _ first as an underground organization staging rallies and putting out clandestine newspapers, and then more openly in factories and offices after a 1986 political amnesty.

 The agreement provided that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> would receive $ 3.25 -LRB- nearly 55 percent -RRB- of the $ 5.95 list price on all retail sales of the book. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> would receive $ 2.70 from which he would pay all printing and marketing expenses. Such `` royalty'' payments are unheard of in the publishing industry. In fact, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s previous royalty contracts with three major publishers provided for standard industry royalties ranging from 10 percent to 15 percent, depending upon sales. <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Janklow </PERSON>, an expert on the publishing industry, testified that no rational publisher would agree to a 55 percent royalty on list price because it could not make a profit. <PERSON> Janklow </PERSON> also testified that in his opinion as literary agent for <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Danielle </PERSON> <PERSON> Steele </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s book was not commercially publishable. Although the agreement also provided that <ORGANIZATION> Madison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> would publish and market the book, in fact, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and his staff provided many of the ordinary services of a publisher and made the most significant contribution to marketing efforts. ... In this instance, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> designed the layout and printed the cover of the book. He hired others to typeset and print the book itself. All other aspects of book production were performed by <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> or his staff. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> also sent out 300 to 500 letters soliciting orders for the book and employed 12 to 15 people for four hours a day during one week to make telephone solicitations from voter registration lists. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> arranged an autograph party, one or two newspaper advertisements and an appearance by <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> on the Larry King Show. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s marketing efforts resulted in precious few sales to `` average citizens.'' In fact, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> testified that he never intended to sell the book to bookstores where average people could buy them because bookstores would only purchase at the discount price of $ 3.00 per copy. `` That does n't leave you much room.'' The real focus of the marketing effort for `` Reflections of a Public Man'' was on bulk sales to trade associations and other groups. Almost 98 percent of all sales of `` Reflections of a Public Man'' were bulk sales of 15 or more books. In some instances, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s staff informed various groups <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> spoke to that because he had already reached the maximum limit on outside earned income for that year, he would not be able to keep an honoraium offered to him. The staff then recommended that instead of paying <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> an honorarium, the organization could purchase books for the same amount. For example, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> gave a lecture in October 1984 at <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. The University paid <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> an honorarium of $ 3,000 in addition to his expenses, but was subsequently informed by <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s staff that he would be unable to accept the honorarium. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s staff suggested that the University purchase 504 books for $ 3,000 in lieu of the honorarium. The University purchased the books and distributed most of them to students in its political science department. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> endorsed the $ 3,000 check over to <ORGANIZATION> Madison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>. Despite the change in the nature of the transaction, the University's records plainly list the $ 3,000 expenditure as an honorarium for <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s appearance. Instead of passing up $ 3,000 or donating it to charity, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> thus received a $ 1,650 `` royalty'' for his lecture at the University. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> also spoke at a <ORGANIZATION> Satellite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- `` SBCA'' -RRB- trade show in September 1985 just several weeks after <ORGANIZATION> SBCA </ORGANIZATION> had purchased 1,680 copies of `` Reflections of a Public Man'' for $ 10,000. <ORGANIZATION> SBCA </ORGANIZATION> testified that although it historically has paid honoraria and expenses to congressmen for their appearances, in this case <ORGANIZATION> SBCA </ORGANIZATION>'s legal counsel, who arranged for <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> to speak at the trade show, suggested that <ORGANIZATION> SBCA </ORGANIZATION> purchase the books instead. Thus <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> received a $ 5,500 `` royalty'' for his appearance before the <ORGANIZATION> SBCA </ORGANIZATION>. Not all bulk sales were in lieu of honoraria. For example, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> arranged a sale of 2,000 books to the Teamsters for $ 12,200 paid out of the DRIVE Political Fund. The books were distributed to Teamster members. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> had not spoken at any Teamster event. In addition, <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Payte </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> real estate developer, testified that he wanted to give <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> a $ 5,000 gift and, in fact, had given a $ 5,000 check to <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> subsequently informed him that he could not accept the gift and returned the check to <LOCATION> Payte </LOCATION>. Payte continued to search for a way to give cash to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and shortly after receiving the first check back from <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, wrote a second $ 5,000 check, this time to Madison Systems for `` revision and distribution of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s books.'' <PERSON> Payte </PERSON> testified that he expected to receive 1,000 copies of the revised edition of the book and, in fact, he made a second payment of $ 1,000 when he realized that $ 5,000 would not buy 1,000 copies of the $ 5.95 book. However, the book was never revised. Payte testified he received approximately 300 to 500 copies of the old book instead. No further accounting was made.

 Former hostage <PERSON> John-Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON> on Monday urged <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to follow the example set by <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and negotiate the release of its citizens held captive in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> `` has abandoned'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, 32, a television reporter abducted on his way to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> airport. `` British officials say they wo n't negotiate because it will only lead to the taking of other hostages,'' <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON> told a meeting to mark the third anniversary of <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>'s kidnapping. `` I say you can negotiate without giving in.'' The French and West German governments managed to secure the release of their hostages without being brought to their knees, <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON> said at the meeting organized by British and <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> journalists. <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON>, a magazine writer and French citizen, was freed in May 1988 after more than three years' captivity. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, which was under constant pressure to get back its hostages, has denied paying ransom. It complied with several Iranian demands, including banishing the main Iranian opposition group from <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON> said he recently helped mark the start of the fifth anniversary in captivity of <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 42, the chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> and the longest held of 15 Western hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> was abducted March 16, 1985. `` There's something cruel in these anniversaries,'' <PERSON> Kauffman </PERSON> said. Those at Monday's meeting at <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION> headquarters issued an appeal to all with influence `` to do whatever they can immediately to help secure their release.'' Organizer <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Brock </PERSON>, a British writer, said the appeal would be sent to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> and the Iranian and Syrian embassies in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> influences Moslem extremists holding the hostages, while <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> is the main foreign power broker in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. A group working for <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>'s release ran cinema, television and newspaper advertisements Monday. One asked moviegoers in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to close their eyes and think of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, because <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> has `` done nothing else for the last three years.'' In a message with Arabic voice-over on Lebanese television, the hostage's father, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON>, told his son, `` Whatever you do, old chap, keep your spirits up.'' Similar messages were published in the <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> daily As-Safir. Another message in the newspaper, signed `` Jill'' and apparently from <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>'s girlfriend, <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> Morell </PERSON>, said: `` I wish more than anything that you could be back home with us. But until then, I'm sending you all my special love. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> seeks the release of three of its nationals held by pro-Iranian Islamic fundamentalists _ <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Anglican </PERSON> envoy <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> and teacher <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> man with dual British and <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> nationality whose release is also sought by the Irish government. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> says it also seeks word on <PERSON> Alec </PERSON> <PERSON> Collett </PERSON>, a New York-based British journalist whose Palestinian abductors claim they killed him. His body was never found.

 As the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> opened debate Monday on President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s slightly altered plan for bailing out savings and loan depositors, Republicans blamed <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democrats for the bulk of costs. `` There's enough blame to go around, but if you want to single out one culprit, it's the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Garn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, the ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Garn </PERSON> said the bailout costs _ estimated at a minimum of $ 157 billion over the next 10 years _ would be only half as much if in 1986, the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had gone along with a Senate-approved measure to pump $ 15 billion into the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L insurance funds to close insolvent thrifts then. `` The kindest thing I can say about the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is only that it is totally irresponsible,'' <PERSON> Garn </PERSON> said, referring to action last week by a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee that would require S & amp; L owners to put up less of their own money to stay in business. Former S & amp; L regulators have blamed <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> for stalling the 1986 legislation on behalf of thrift operators in his state. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Monday cleared <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> of charges he improperly intervened with <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L regulators but concluded that there is `` reason to believe'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> violated official rules of conduct 69 times by not disclosing thousands of dollars in alleged gifts. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, D-Mich., said state chartered thrifts in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> accounted for 70 percent of the $ 38 billion the government committed last year to resolve thrift problems `` I do n't think we can let irresponsible state legislatures hold the key to federal deposit insurance funds,'' he said, referring to changes his committee made in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan to put more restrictions on state-chartered S & amp; Ls. <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> said the legislation `` breaks up the close relationship between the thrift industry and its regulators'' while assuring the survival of most S & amp; Ls as the originator of half of the nation's home mortgages But he said `` there is no certain guarantee that this plan or any plan will work as intended'' and conceded that taxpayers may be asked again in the future to come up with more money. `` We can say that this package is the soundest and the toughest we could put together within the time bounds given us,'' he said, referring to the seven weeks since the package was put forth by the White House. Both <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Garn </PERSON>, as well as other members from both parties on the banking committee, pleaded with their colleagues to forego offering amendments to the 564-page bill. `` We may have a long fight ahead with the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Garn </PERSON> said. `` Extraneous and controversial amendments would upset the delicate balance we've reached.'' However, several amendments were in the works, according to <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> aides, although none were offered or voted on Monday. Among them was one by Sen. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.D. </LOCATION>, that would stretch out to June 1994, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s June 1991 deadline for small <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L operators with loans of less than $ 100 million to effectively double the amount of their own money at risk. <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON> complained the bill provides `` a heavy advantage toward larger institutions'' by allowing them to stretch out to as long as 25 years good-will exemptions from the capital requirements. A spokeswoman for Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, said he is considering proposing a variety of pro-consumer amendments. Other possible amendments include: _ Reinstating a funding plan authored by <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, who claims it would save $ 150 million a year <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> effectively abandoned the plan last week under a veto threat by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> but Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said he assumes it will consume `` considerable debate'' over the next two days. _ Giving non-profit groups and local housing agencies a 90-day right of first refusal to purchase at `` appraised market prices'' residential property that has fallen into the government's hand through loan defaults to insolvent S & amp; Ls The amendment by Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, D-Mass., was defeated in the <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, where it was criticized by Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, as `` social engineering. Meanwhile, three consumers groups _ the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Consumers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Now </ORGANIZATION> _ on Monday criticized both the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> versions of the S & amp; L bill. `` Last week the banking committees led us down a primrose path that threatens to end in another nightmare of S & amp; L insolvencies and enormous public debt,'' said <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a CFA lobbyist. `` What you have to concentrate on is the loopholes, because they're broad ... and easily used.''

<HEAD>New Report Sees Unfair Trade Barriers by Japanese</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> lawmakers said Monday that a draft <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report on Japanese barriers to imports of American wood products should bolster the case for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions. The draft report, obtained Monday, says <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> uses unfair trade practices, including high tariffs, subisidies and even building codes that require the use of nails that can crack <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> plywood, to protect their mills from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imports. The report said Japanese tariffs and other barriers were designed to bolster imports of raw logs and discourage imports of finished products. Despite earlier progress in opening some parts of the Japanese market, the report said barriers remain which impede <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imports, and it said the government of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has refused to enter into a new round of talks. The report said `` it is unlikely that any further concessions will be forthcoming unless additional <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts are made. Such concessions would only be obtained if there were a clear incentive or at the least inclusion of these barriers in the high priority of issues to be resolved by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Japanese governments.'' Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>, R-Ore., who requested the study more than a year ago, said it should bolster the case for imposing trade sanctions against <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> unless the barriers are removed Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON>, D-Ore., who had earlier called for sanctions, said in a letter to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> the report `` strongly supports'' a need for aggressive action by the administration Last month, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> asked <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> to rule the Japanese were engaging in unfair trade practices involving forest products and, if negotiations failed to resolve the dispute after 18 months, to impose sanctions. The association has estimated that exports of finished <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forest products to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> could increase $ 1.2 billion annually if the barriers were lifted.

 Criticism grew of how police handled the stadium crush that killed 94 soccer fans, and the government said Monday it may ban standing-room-only sections like the one where the tragedy occurred. Officials and fans accused <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yorkshire </LOCATION> police of letting thousands of late arrivals into <LOCATION> Hillsborough </LOCATION> stadium, then reacting too slowly when the surging crowd crushed people against a steel anti-riot fence in one of the concrete terrace areas packed with standees. Home Secretary <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON>, speaking to a hushed <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>, said an investigative panel led by <ORGANIZATION> Lord </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taylor </ORGANIZATION> would begin work Tuesday and `` make recommendations about the needs of crowd control and safety at sports grounds.'' `` We have to set our sights high and find a better way for British football -LRB- soccer -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said. `` We owe a duty to these passionate supporters of football to examine urgently and thoroughly the causes and background and to do all in our power to prevent such a thing happening again.'' <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> told the Commons the decision of a senior police officer to open the gate because he `` considered that there was a possible danger to the lives of the spectators at the front'' would be a central question for investigators. Survivors said about 4,000 fans were pushing at turnstiles to get inside. Hillsborough gatekeeper <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Sheffield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> he refused police orders to open the outer gate and was forced to hand over his keys to a police inspector. `` I handed the keys to him and told him it was his responsibility and not mine,'' <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> was quoted as saying. <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> fan <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitton </PERSON>, who was caught in the crush outside the gate, told BBC-TV: `` The steward put his hand on the gate and said, ` Do n't open it.' The police said, ` Open the gate. There's going to be a crush.' Then two police officers opened the gate.'' The crush was so great, <PERSON> Mitton </PERSON> said, that fans fell on the floor and people climbed over them. `` All the police were doing was standing up saying ` Get back, get back.' There was already people dead then. I climbed on them to get over the fence.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Sheffield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> said a police superintendent made the decision to open the 16-foot-wide gate because he feared a wall was seconds away from collapsing on hundreds of fans. `` Startled officers _ some of them hemmed in _ thought the wall was beginning to buckle under the enormous pressure of screaming fans. The crowd was packed so tightly around a police horse that it was lifted six inches off the ground,'' the paper said. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yorkshire </LOCATION> police, who have handed over a separate investigation of the policing of the match to the neighboring <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Midlands </LOCATION> police force, refused to comment on the <ORGANIZATION> Sheffield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> report. Police Federation representative <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Middup </PERSON> attacked growing public criticism of police actions as `` grossly unfair,'' saying they faced a situation `` for which no amount of training could prepare them.'' Police on Monday released the names of the 94 victims. All were British, 34 were teen-agers, 33 were in their 20s, and seven were women. Press Association, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s domestic news agency, said as many as 40 who perished are thought to have died in the rush through a tunnel to the center terrace at the <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> goal. The rest were crushed against the 10-foot fence in front of the terrace or were trampled underfoot, it said. They ranged in age from 10 to 67. Of the 170 injured, 47 remained hospitalized Monday, including 17 in intensive care. Prince <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, heir to the British throne, and his wife, <PERSON> Diana </PERSON>, visited some of the hospitalized fans, as did <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> soccer team members, who came with team scarves and souvenirs. In <LOCATION> Liverpool </LOCATION>, where most victims lived, the city council Monday called an official week of mourning and discussed ways of helping the bereaved and injured. In the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said the government believes the future of soccer lies `` in providing all-seated accommodation at major football clubs.'' Most British soccer stadiums have seats and standing-room-only terraces, which are cheaper and generally favored by young fans. <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said Justice <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> would also review the fencing in soccer stadiums, which has been required in many areas to prevent fan violence. Several soccer clubs, including <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION>, announced Monday they were preparing to tear down their fences without waiting for the government to act <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> told the Commons the government also planned to go ahead with legislation requiring all fans attending soccer matches to have identity cards issued by the teams. This was a key part of the government's plans to crack down on soccer hooliganism. Club officials and fans have objected to the proposal as too expensive and a logistical nightmare. Opposition lawmakers urged the government to delay the identity card bill until <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>'s report was completed `` For God's sake, do not let our people be trapped like animals again,'' said <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Heffer </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> lawmaker from <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION>, who also urged the government to take some immediate steps to improve the safety of stadiums. Messages of condolence continued to arrive, including one from Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who said: `` Life indeed brings unexpected tragic situations, both in our and in your countries.''

<HEAD>WASHN: committee statement.</HEAD>
<HEAD>COMMITTEE ACTION TAKEN IN CONNECTION WITH ITEM NO. 1</HEAD>
<HEAD>OF THE RESOLUTION OF PRELIMINARY INQUIRY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The first area addressed in the Preliminary Inquiry concerns: The circumstances surrounding lobbying efforts on behalf of a constituent with whom he -LRB- Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> -RRB- had an interest in a private gas well venture. Special Outside Counsel reported that, beginning in late 1978, Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> intervened with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> and the Egyptian government on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> Neptune </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> -RRB- in order to secure for <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> an opportunity to resolve a dispute with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> over the right to explore, develop, and operate offshore oil fields in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Suez </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> had a contract with the State of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to explore and develop the Israeli-occupied territory. However, as a result of the Camp David accords in September of 1978 and the subsequent peace treaty negotiations, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was required to return the occupied Sinai and <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Suez </LOCATION> territory to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, relinquishing all rights to the oil fields without compensation. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> would not recognize <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s rights under the Israeli contract. Thus <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> stood to lose its investment and expected profit from the operation of the oil fields. Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> introduced <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Moncrief </PERSON> and other <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> principals to <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials, contacted Secretary of State <PERSON> Cyrus </PERSON> <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> and Egyptian Ambassador <PERSON> Ashraf </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghorbal </PERSON>, and personally delivered a letter dated March 27, 1979, to Egyptian President <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Sadat </PERSON> while he was in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> seeking President <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>'s consideraton of <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s plight. In counsel's view, Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s intervention on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> Neptune </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> did not in itself appear to have violated any law or ethical standard. During the period Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> intervened on <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s behalf, he also accepted the opportunity to purchase a percentage of the <PERSON> Moncrief </PERSON> family's interest in two east-Texas gas wells offered by W. A `` Monty'' <PERSON> Moncrief </PERSON>, the late patriarch of the <PERSON> Moncrief </PERSON> family who was for many years active in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, as a lobbyist for the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The first opportunity, the Whatley Well No. 1, located in <LOCATION> Freestone </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, appears to have been an ordinary, business transaction. ... The record establishes that Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> risked the amount of his share of the drilling costs against the chance that the well would be dry. Had the well been dry, Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s investment would have been lost. Once gas was discovered in the <LOCATION> Whatley </LOCATION> well, although it was commercially productive, it was clear that production and, therefore, profit from the well, would be substantially less than had been anticipated. Consequently, in 1984, at a time when the <PERSON> Whatley </PERSON> well was `` shut in,'' i.e., had temporarily ceased production, Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Monty </PERSON> <PERSON> Moncrief </PERSON> to buy back his interest in the well. ... <PERSON> Monty </PERSON> <PERSON> Moncrief </PERSON> agreed to buy back Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Whatley </PERSON> interest for $ 20,000 While <PERSON> Moncrief </PERSON>'s repurchase of Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s interest in the <PERSON> Whatley </PERSON> well appears to have been a favor to Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, it also appears to have been purchased at about the market value of the interest. Therefore, counsel concluded that there was no gift to Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. The committee concurred with counsel's findings. Accordingly, Item No. 1 in the committee's Resolution of Preliminary Inquiry, to the extent that it was predicated on Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s interest in the <PERSON> Whatley </PERSON> well, does not warrant further action by the committee ... However, in the course of pursuing the circumstances surrounding Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s interest in the <LOCATION> Whatley </LOCATION> well, the Special Outside Counsel identified a second well in which Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> had an interest which, in counsel's view, raised a question of improper conduct. This matter concerned Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s acquisition of an interest in the <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> No 1 well. Counsel reported that during calendar year 1979, Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> acquired an interest in the <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> No. 1 well, the opportunity to invest in such well also having been afforded to him by the late W. A. `` Monty'' <PERSON> Moncrief </PERSON>, an individual having a direct interest in legislation. Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> purchased his interest by check dated October 11, 1979, in response to a bill from the <ORGANIZATION> Moncriefs </ORGANIZATION> dated August 20, 1979, for $ 29,036.91 -LRB- with approximately $ 50,000 having been paid in total -RRB- _ the pre-drilling completion cost to invest _ but after the well had been drilled and determined to be a successful venture on June 27, 1979. Since, at the time of his purchase, Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s share was valued at approximately $ 132,000-140 ,000, Counsel believed the congressman received a gift of approximately $ 82,000-90 ,000 from Mr. <PERSON> Moncrief </PERSON> in reduced purchase Moreover, during the period immediately prior to when Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> acquired this interest, counsel noted he had actively intervened on behalf of the <PERSON> Moncrief </PERSON> family with respect to capital investments the family had in the <LOCATION> Sinai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>.

 Residents sought shelter Monday in basements and bunkers during citywide shelling that killed at least 45 people in three days and touched off international appeals for a cease-fire. The rocket and artillery barrages slammed into both the Christian and Moslem sectors during intensified fighting in and around <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> between Christian army units and an alliance of Druse militiamen and Syrian troops. The dead included <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Aristegui </PERSON>, and his father-in-law, prominent Lebanese poet <PERSON> Tewfic </PERSON> <PERSON> Youssef </PERSON> <PERSON> Awwad </PERSON>. Warrant Officer <PERSON> Youssef </PERSON> <PERSON> Bitar </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> army's top explosives specialist, said on Christian-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> radio the ambassador's residence was hit by a Syrian shell Police also said 175 people were wounded in renewed bombardments that broke out late Saturday. Police put the toll in 41 days of fighting at 262 killed and 932 wounded. The overwhelming majority of the victims have been civilians. Tens of thousands of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> residents had hardly emerged from their shelters Monday morning during a brief lull when guns and rocket launchers thundered back into action, sending them back underground. Many were trapped without water or electricity. Smoldering cars lay charred Monday in streets littered with glass shards and severed power cables. Hundreds of fashionable boutiques were gutted. Many buildings burned down because firefighters had no water. Only a few bakeries opened Monday morning, but there was not enough bread to go around. `` Please, please. I need five loaves. I have five children that I have to feed,'' shouted housewife <PERSON> Amina </PERSON> <PERSON> Shehab </PERSON> outside a bakery in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The baker yelled back: `` I've less than three dozen loaves, and there are many other people who want to eat as well. I can only give you two loaves.'' `` <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s apocalypse persists,'' <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s independent daily <ORGANIZATION> An-Nahar </ORGANIZATION> said in a front-page editorial Monday. The prime minister of the <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> in the split government, <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, said Monday he reached agreement with French Humanitarian Assistance Minister <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kouchner </PERSON> to evacuate more wounded civilians. A source close to <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> later said Moslem victims of the fighting would be evacuated to a French hospital ship on Tuesday if security conditions permit. Fourteen Christian victims were ferried to a French boat from the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> port of <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION> on Friday. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> appealed for an end to the confrontation, which has developed into one of the bloodiest rounds of the 14-year-old civil war. Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> urged the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> nations to use their influence to bring about an immediate cease-fire. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> deputy spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said, `` All parties, including <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, which is a direct participant in the artillery exchanges ... must stop the fighting.'' <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON>, called for an emergency <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> council meeting. The battles began after Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>, ordered his forces to blockade several ports controlled by Moslem militiamen. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> rallied to the militiamens' aid, and <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> pledged to expel the estimated 40,000 Syrian troops from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> The <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> invited <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> to send in its forces as peacekeepers in 1976. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, in an interview released Monday, accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of covering up for Syrian attacks in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is undoubtedly trying to solve the <LOCATION> Palestinian-Israeli </LOCATION> or the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> problem at <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s expense and is thus sponsoring this dirty Syrian role in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>,'' he was quoted as saying by the London-based newsletter <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mirror </LOCATION> Text of the interview was sent by telex to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials were trying to portray Lebanese strife as a problem between Moslems and Christians, but he said it is caused by occupation by Syrian and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> forces, according to the interview. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> occupies a self-proclaimed `` security zone'' up to 10 miles deep in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.

 In counsel's view, Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s actions on behalf of the <PERSON> Moncrief </PERSON> family at a time when he acquired an interest in the <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> No. 1 well below its fair market value, represented a violation of Consideration No. 5 of the Code of Ethics for <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which states, in part, that any person in government service should `` never accept for himself or his family, favors or benefits under circumstances which might be construed by reasonable persons as influencing the performance of his governmental duties.'' The Special Outside Counsel also indicated that such a violation also represents action which does not reflect creditably on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> in violation of House Rule XLIII, clause 1. Finally, because Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> did not report as a gift the below-market purchase of his L. D. Williams No. 1 well interest on his financial disclosure statement for calendar year 1979, coupled with the fact that this gift was worth more than $ 100, counsel believed that Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> violated <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Rule XLIV _ reporting receipt of gift, and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Rule XLIII, clause 4, which imposes a limit of $ 100 on gifts received from persons having a direct interest in legislation. The committee did not concur with the Special Outside Counsel. This conclusion rested on five grounds. First, the absence of any formal communication between Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and <PERSON> Monty </PERSON> <PERSON> Moncrief </PERSON> or the <PERSON> Moncrief </PERSON> oil organization indicating the congressman's commitment to acquire an interest in the <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> No. 1 well did not, in and of itself, support a conclusion that there had been no agreement for Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> to acquire his interest prior to the successful completion of the well in June, 1979. In this connection, the committee believes it is reasonable to infer that, Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> established his good faith in entering into a business transaction with the <ORGANIZATION> Moncriefs </ORGANIZATION> in connection with the <PERSON> Whatley </PERSON> well. Second, it appears that Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s transaction with the <ORGANIZATION> Moncriefs </ORGANIZATION> was handled no differently than the purchase of an interest in the same well by <PERSON> Monty </PERSON> <PERSON> Moncrief </PERSON>'s grandchildren. Specifically, the <PERSON> Moncrief </PERSON> grandchildren also purchased their interest in the well, through a trust agreement, at the same time Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> acquired his interest. All of these transactions occurred subsequent to the successful completion of the well. Third, Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s October 4, 1979, loan transaction with <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> to obtain the funds -LRB- $ 35,000 -RRB- required to defray the cost of his acquisition in the well occurred a short time after his receipt of a bill from the <ORGANIZATION> Moncriefs </ORGANIZATION> for his share of drilling costs. In this regard, the committee believes it is reasonable that the congressman delayed his loan transaction to avoid paying interest on the funds until there was a need for him to meet his financial obligations arising out of the purchase. ... Fourth, the original correspondence from <PERSON> Monty </PERSON> <PERSON> Moncrief </PERSON> to Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> dated February 22, 1979, clearly indicated the possibility that the congressman might be interested in one or two oil and gas ventures _ which later resulted in his acquisition of interests in the Whatley No. 1 well and the <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> No. 1 well. The fact that an ambiguity arises by virtue of Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s February 26, 1979, letter in response to the earlier -LRB- February 22, 1979 -RRB- correspondence from <PERSON> Monty </PERSON> <PERSON> Moncrief </PERSON> _ wherein the congressman indicated his interest in participating in one venture _ was not viewed as supporting the conclusion that Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> intended to purchase an interest in only one well. Accordingly, the ambiguity in the correspondence was resolved in favor of Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. Finally, Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s financial disclosure statement for calendar year 1979 indicated that the interest was acquired in April of that year. In the light of the foregoing, the committee did not conclude that there was a reason to believe that Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> violated any controlling standards of conduct in connection with his purchase of an interest in the <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> No. 1.

 A helicopter swooped into a prison's high-security exercise yard Monday and a convicted drug kingpin jumped aboard, but the chopper caught a fence and crashed in the yard, injuring the would-be escapee and his pilot. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> `` Barry'' <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>, 36, a former powerboat champion serving life without parole as the leader of a marijuana-trafficking ring, broke his right leg in the accident. The pilot suffered two broken legs and facial injuries. `` <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> apparently was ready, and as soon as the helicopter was there, he jumped right into it,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, warden at the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said three armed guards watched but did not react because they did not want to shoot into the prison yard, where a half-dozen men were exercising. He also said they feared there might be a hostage in the helicopter. Most of <ORGANIZATION> MCC </ORGANIZATION> is medium-security, but <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> and about 50 other prisoners were being held in a special high-security area because they were considered escape risks. The two-seater Bell helicopter, a type once flown for military reconnaissance but now used mainly for aerial photography or crop-spraying, flew into the prison just after 10 a.m., <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. It dropped low enough for <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> to jump onto one landing skid, and was beginning to rise when its tail rotor caught in barbed wire atop the metal fence around the exercise area. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said at least one other prisoner may have tried to jump on the helicopter, possibly destabilizing the small craft. The accident sent pieces of the rotor and the fence hurtling hundreds of yards. `` It's lucky more people were n't hurt,'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. Prison guards immediately pulled <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> and the pilot from the wreckage and administered first aid before they were taken to a hospital. Authorities identified the pilot as <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, 34, of Gold Beach, Ore. The Bell 47D-1 helicopter, built in 1952, was reported sold in January to <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Gold </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, a sea urchin diver, worked with <ORGANIZATION> Sin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Gold </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, according to a man who answered the phone there. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> left town about a month ago, said the man, who refused to give his name. An aviation official who spoke under condition of anonymity said the helicopter was spotted last month on a truck near <LOCATION> Tamiami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, a few miles from the prison. The truck carried an <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> registration, the source said. But the copter apparently took off from <LOCATION> Opa-locka </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, about 25 miles north of the prison, the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Marshal's office said. After the crash, all 1,000 inmates were locked down, and officials began interviewing prisoners who were in the yard at the time, <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. Prisoners, even in the highsecurity area, have phone privileges and all calls are tape-recorded, he said. `` Obviously we will be going back and checking the calls that <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> made,'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> was convicted in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, along with former car-racing star <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lanier </PERSON>, on charges of running a multimillion-dollar pot-smuggling ring. He was sentenced to life without parole. He was brought to <ORGANIZATION> MCC </ORGANIZATION> from a federal prison at <LOCATION> Ray </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brook </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, in December to face another marijuana-smuggling indictment in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> and a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> gun charge on which he already has been convicted. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Marshal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Horgan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> will also be charged with attempted escape, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and the pilot will face charges of aiding an escape. According to the <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> drug racketeering indictment, <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> imported tons of marijuana to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, and shifted millions of dollars between accounts in <LOCATION> Lichtenstein </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. Three years ago, another <ORGANIZATION> MCC </ORGANIZATION> inmate tried a helicopter escape. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Betzner </PERSON>, who later testified about alleged guns-for-drugs schemes to arm the Contra rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, arranged to hire a helicopter that flew into the prison. But <PERSON> Betzner </PERSON>'s contact was an undercover agent, and the helicopter carried agents who arrested him when he ran to it.

 A former government employee went to court Monday seeking to halt construction of apartments and an underground garage on a site he claims was a nuclear dump. <PERSON> Oleg </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyanin </PERSON> said the site, along the <LOCATION> Leninsky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prospekt </LOCATION> thoroughfare in south <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, was used to bury wastes from uranium processing at the beginning of the Soviet nuclear effort in the 1940s. No official evidence has been released that the dump exists and there is no evidence of nuclear leaks, the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> man said in a telephone interview. But he claimed scientists involved in the nuclear effort have pinpointed the spot and several others as the sites of nuclear dumps. `` We're sure there's a map, perhaps several made at different intervals of where and what is in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Lyanin </PERSON>, a former negotiator and translator for the Ministry of Foreign Trade. He said he filed his first court documents April 10 asking that the case be turned over to prosecutors for investigation of possible criminal charges. He said that request was granted three days later. According to a law passed after the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear accident, disturbing buried radioactive waste is punishable by up to 10 years in prison, according to <LOCATION> Lyanin </LOCATION>. He said that in his court appearance Monday he asked the court to halt construction of the garage and apartments to `` leave trouble where it lies.'' There has been much greater concern in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> about nuclear safety since the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear power plant disaster in April 1986. At least 31 people perished when a reactor exploded. The site for the garage and apartments in southern <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> is less than a half-mile from the <ORGANIZATION> Anglo-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, whose 200 pupils include children of diplomats and business representatives from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and other countries. The director of the <ORGANIZATION> Anglo-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Vera </PERSON> <PERSON> Nordal </PERSON>, said Soviet officials have not contacted the school about the matter. She said <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> officials checked the area for radiation Monday and tests conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> following the Chernobyl accident did not turn up radiation near the school. <PERSON> Lyanin </PERSON> said the planned apartments would be occupied by members of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> and officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unions </ORGANIZATION>. He said excavation for the $ 24 million project began recently but has been halted pending a decision on his petitions in the <PERSON> Dzerzhinsky </PERSON> region People's Court. Residents of the region have held several meetings to oppose the construction project, according to <PERSON> Lyanin </PERSON>.

 A man was reported killed Monday during a demonstration by several thousand supporters of the fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> against the suspension of Islamic law in <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>. Spokesmen for the front identified the victim as <PERSON> Shayk </PERSON> <PERSON> Rayeh </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON>, but did not give details or accuse anyone in his death. As they marched through central <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>, protesters chanted: `` There is no God but Allah! There is no alternative to <ORGANIZATION> Sharia </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Islamic law -RRB-! `` It was the fourth day of demonstrations, which began after <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> voted to postpone debate on <LOCATION> Sharia </LOCATION>, or Islamic law, until a national constitutional conference convenes. The conference is to assemble all political forces, including the rebel <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, and one of its purposes is to find a solution to the 6-year-old civil war in the south. Suspending Islamic law, which President <PERSON> Gaafar </PERSON> <PERSON> Nimeiri </PERSON> put into effect two years before he was overthrown in 1985, has been a major demand by the south. Most people there are Christians or animists, while <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> and the rest of the north is overwhelmingly Moslem. <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Osman </PERSON> <PERSON> Taha </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>'s leader in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, told the marchers Monday: `` Demonstrations will continue day and night until this government of traitors ... non-believers is toppled. `` You have come out to tell them there are sharp swords ready to defend the Sharia of Allah.'' Riot police did not interfere, although the protests violate an <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> ban on demonstrations. Interior Minister <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Fadil </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> said in a statement later, however, that security forces would use force if necessary to end unauthorized protests. <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> said two demonstrators were injured in addition to the one killed, but did not elaborate.

<HEAD>House Passes Hatch Act Change</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> gave overwhelming approval Monday to a measure that would repeal major portions of the Hatch Act and allow federal <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> employees to participate in partisan political activity on their own time. But despite the 297-90 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote, final enactment into law is far from certain. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved an almost identical bill last year, but it died in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The administration is opposed to the bill and Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> has said he will recommend a veto should it reach President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s desk. Nonetheless, the measure was pushed strongly by various unions representing federal workers and their leaders were quick to praise the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members who voted for it. `` This is not a political party issue ... it's a political freedom issue,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tobias </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. `` We urge the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to join the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in standing firmly on the side of rights for federal workers.'' However, <PERSON> Tobias </PERSON>' statement did not suggest there was anything more than an `` excellent possibility'' the measure will pass the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The bill would: _ Allow federal employees to run for partisan political office on their own time, without taking a leave of absence unless campaigning would interfere with performance of their duties _ Permit employees to request unpaid leave to run for office and says leave must be granted unless the agency they work for determines they can not be spared _ Allow federal employees to manage political campaigns and raise campaign money during off-duty hours The measure would clarify and, in many cases, strengthen current Hatch Act prohibitions against using a federal position for political purposes. In a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said enactment of provisions in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> will `` would lead to a tragic repoliticization of the federal workforce.'' Aside from concerns about specifics of the bill, wrote <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, the overall effect on public perception of the fairness of government dealing `` might well be devastaging.'' `` For example, if it appears that a candidate of Party A has misappropirated funds, it will not inspire confidence to learn that the local <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office charged with investigating the allegation is headed by that candidate's campaign manager,'' he said.

 Some bulk purchasers did not even want the books they paid for. For example, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> addressed the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Mid-Continent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Mid-Continent purchased $ 1,000 worth of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s book in lieu of paying him an honorarium, but asked to receive only three books. Mid-Continent suggested that the remaining books be distributed to libraries and other public institutions of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s choice. There are no records reflecting the requested distribution. The Select Committee on Ethics interpreted Rule XLVII, clause 1 in Advisory Opinion No. 13 which makes it clear that the limitations on outside earned income may not be avoided by the mere characterization of a payment. `` In all cases, the real facts will control.'' -LRB- Select Committee on Ethics, Advisory Opinion No. 13, Ethics Manual p. 179. -RRB- In this case, the facts reveal that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> compiled a series of previous speeches and writings into a commercially unpublishable manuscript. His good friend <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> formed a publishing company for the purpose of producing the book and entering into a so-called `` royalty'' agreement inordinately favorable to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. Together they sold the book almost exclusively to lobbyists, persons interested in legislation and other interest groups in order to provide income to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. The resulting income does not therefore become `` royalty'' income just because <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> calls himself a `` publisher'' and claims to pay `` royalties'' on book sales. The `` royalty'' contract was not an arms-length agreement between an author and his publisher, but a joint business venture _ a means by which <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> could help his friend <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> obtain money in excess of congressional limitations. Receipts from sales of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s book should thus be characterized as outside earned income, not copyright royalties, and subject to the limits and reporting requirements for such income. As Advisory Opinion No. 13 makes clear, income a member earns through his own personal efforts is earned income for purposes of Rule XLVII, clause 1 even when the income is first paid to a corporation and then distributed to the member. In this matter, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> earned income from the books through his performance of publisher's duties including the marketing of the book. However, whether or not the income from sales of the book may be considered `` royalties,'' when books are allegedly `` sold'' to lobbyists or interest groups, but no books are delivered to those groups in exchange for their payments, the books retained are `` gifts'' received from persons with an interest in legislation before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Those books are also `` gifts'' when the group `` donates'' the books to a library or institution of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s choice Furthermore, where the books are purchased in lieu of paying a customary fee for a speech or appearance, the payment received is an `` honorarium,'' in the form of a `` royalty.'' The term `` honorarium'' is defined to mean `` the payment of something of value ` accepted as consideration for an appearance, speech, or article.''' -LRB- Ethics manual, p. 83, quoting 11 C.F.R. 110.12 -LRB- b -RRB-; see also 2 U.S.C. 31-1. -RRB- In this case, the `` royalty'' was itself the honorarium paid for <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s appearance. Thus as discussed in full in Section III. C. of this Report, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s receipts of outside earned income, including honoraria, in excess of 30 percent of his congressional salary are violations of House Rule XLVII, clause 1. In addition, gifts exceeding $ 100 from lobbyists and other groups with interests in legislation before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are violations of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rule XLIII, clause 4. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s receipt of an honorarium in excess of the $ 2,000 limit imposed by 2 U.S.C 441i is a violation of that law. Finally, his failures to disclose the receipts of income, gifts and honoraria are violations of House Rule XLIV. We found no evidence that campaign funds were used to produce the book.

 <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> used members of his staff to compile, type, proofread, edit, and market his book, `` Reflections of a Public Man.''

<DATELINE>ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> has ordered all soccer matches suspended for a week following the stabbing of a goalie by fans during a riot last week, officials said. In <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, a newspaper reported Monday that 18 people were injured on April 7 when thousands of fans made a rush for tickets to a soccer match. The reports followed the deaths of 94 British fans during a mad rush Saturday at a soccer match in <LOCATION> Sheffield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. The president of the Algerian <ORGANIZATION> Football </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Baghdadi </PERSON>, said matches were suspended Saturday and would not resume for a week. The statement Sunday came in response to violence at a match the day before between <PERSON> Constantine </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Setif </LOCATION> that left two players injured. <LOCATION> Setif </LOCATION> goalie <PERSON> Antar </PERSON> <PERSON> Osmani </PERSON> was circled by about 100 fans and then stabbed in the abdomen. He said he had never seen `` such savagery'' during his 14-year career. It was not clear why <PERSON> Osmani </PERSON> was attacked. <PERSON> Baghdadi </PERSON> said the suspension should be used for `` meditation, consciousness-raising and a call to responsibility.'' In <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, the government-run newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> said fans were injured during a run on tickets April 7 for a Union of European Football Associations semifinal game between the <ORGANIZATION> Dynamo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dresden </ORGANIZATION> soccer club and <LOCATION> Stuttgart </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The newspaper printed a letter by students of <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Technical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, which said the ticket sale began suddenly around midnight, causing `` chaotic conditions. It also printed a reply by <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Stehr </PERSON>, security chief for the <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION> club, which said 18 people were hurt. <PERSON> Stehr </PERSON>'s letter said the injuries were caused by `` inconsiderate behavior and by the pushing and shoving of the unreasonable -LRB- fans -RRB-.'' He said the club also would revise the way it sold tickets. The newspaper earlier reported that some fans had been camping for two days for tickets to Wednesday's game. The students' letter said the box offices `` opened suddenly and prematurely,'' suggesting that the injuries were caused by a crush of thousands of fans trying to get into the line when officials began selling tickets eight hours ahead of the announced time. All 38,000 tickets were sold by the morning, the newspaper said.

<TEXT>
 Certainly, materials paid for by government funds may not be appropriated for personal use. Thus, technically, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s use of a government word processor, for example, to prepare a book from which he derived personal income was a violation of 31 U.S.C. 1301 -LRB- a -RRB- which provides that government appropriations are to be used solely for the purpose for which they were appropriated. It is not so clear, however, whether <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s use of his congressional staff to produce and market his book is a violation of 31 U.S.C. 1301 -LRB- a -RRB-. No attempt was made to keep work on the book separate from work on official business. No records were kept of hours worked on the book as compared to the hours spent on official business. <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Cossolotto </PERSON>, who spent far more time than any other staff employee working on the book, testified that he worked on the book about 200 hours over eight to eleven months. Other staff members also testified that during that period, there were weeks in which staff worked substantially more than 40 hour weeks. Thus it is entirely possible, and in some instances even probable, that although some work on the book was certainly done during the normal 9 to 5 work day, staff employees worked on the book in addition to completing all the work ordinarily done as part of their official duties. Such use of staff time is specifically permitted under <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics guidelines. ... Moreover, members are given wide discretion to determine the conditions and the duties of employment. The enormous breadth and ambiguity of these `` guidelines'' makes it virtually impossible to prevent members from using staff employees paid by government funds from working on projects providing personal income to the member. Thus as discussed in full in Section III. of this Report, because it is impossible to determine with the required certainty that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> had his staff working on the book during time that should have been devoted to his official business, we do not conclude that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> violated any law or standard of conduct.

 In 1979, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and their good friends <PERSON> George </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> formed and became equal shareholders in <LOCATION> Mallightco </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mallightco </PERSON> invested in commercial paper, securities, real estate and oil and gas ventures for the general purpose of making money for its shareholders <PERSON> Mallightco </PERSON> was funded in February 1980 with $ 58,127 in cash from the Mallicks and roughly the equivalent in marketable securities from the Wrights. Throughout <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s investment in <LOCATION> Mallightco </LOCATION>, it was used as a conduit for cash flowing from the Mallicks to the Wrights. For example, <PERSON> Mallightco </PERSON> began lending money to the Mallicks and the <ORGANIZATION> Wrights </ORGANIZATION> in August 1980. The first loan, on August 15, 1980 was for $ 4,375 each. The second loan on September 3, 1980 was for $ 5,536.09 each. The Mallicks paid off their loans in December 1980 by selling <PERSON> Mallightco </PERSON> a 1979 <ORGANIZATION> Cadillac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seville </ORGANIZATION> valued at $ 10,575 and credited against the loans. The Wrights made no payments on these loans during 1980. In September 1980, <PERSON> Marlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> obtained a $ 150,000 loan from the <LOCATION> Ridglea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> which she immediately loaned to <LOCATION> Mallightco </LOCATION>. The interest rate on the loan from <LOCATION> Ridglea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> apparently fluctuated above the prime lending rate. On September 12, 1980, the Mallicks and the <ORGANIZATION> Wrights </ORGANIZATION> then each borrowed $ 75,000 from Malme rate reached 20.5 percent in May 1981 and again in July 1981 -RRB-, the interest rate on the loan from <LOCATION> Mallightco </LOCATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> Wrights </ORGANIZATION> remained at 13.5 percent. The net effect of these loans from <LOCATION> Mallightco </LOCATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> Wrights </ORGANIZATION> is that during the first year of business, the <ORGANIZATION> Wrights </ORGANIZATION> had recovered their entire investment from <LOCATION> Mallightco </LOCATION> plus an additional $ 25,000. The Mallicks had added $ 65,000 in cash and a $ 10,575 car to their initial investment. The <ORGANIZATION> Wrights </ORGANIZATION> received a gift worth over $ 100 from the Mallicks in the form of reduced interest payments during 1981, 1982, and 1984 when market rates exceeded 13.5 percent. They also received a gift from the Mallicks in the form of <PERSON> Marlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>'s creditworthiness and her ability to obtain financing from the <LOCATION> Ridglea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Wrights </ORGANIZATION>. Although the gift is difficult to value, we believe it is worth more than $ 100. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s failure to disclose these gifts are also violations of House Rule XLIV.

<TEXT>
 Sinhalese militants detonated explosives buried in the road and blew up an army truck on Monday in <LOCATION> southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, killing four soldiers and wounding eight, government officials said. The vehicle was on patrol in <LOCATION> Embilipitiya </LOCATION>, 80 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, reported the officials, who can not be identified under briefing rules. They said an attacker was killed during a raid by Sinhalese extremists on a police station in <LOCATION> Kurunagala </LOCATION> district, 85 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. The violence came one day before expiration of a one-week cease-fire announced by President <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>. The truce was part of a peace package the government offered to Sinhalese and Tamil extremists in a bid to end six years of ethnic violence that has claimed at least 12,600 lives. Left-wing Sinhalese militants rejected the offer, but the largest Tamil militant group, the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION>, agreed on Saturday to hold talks with the government. <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> asked the Tamil rebels to pick a team for talks aimed at ending their campaign for a separate Tamil homeland. The Tamil acceptance came after at least 100 people died last week in attacks that were blamed on the rebels. The Tamils, most of them Hindus, comprise 18 percent of this island nation's 16 million people. The Tamils began the separatist campaign in 1983, saying the majority <PERSON> Sinhalese </PERSON> discriminated against them in jobs and education. Sinhalese, mostly Buddhists, make up 75 percent of the population and control the government and the military. The Tamil <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> rejected an India-sponsored July 1987 accord that gave Tamils limited autonomy, complaining it did not meet their demands for self-rule. <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> lies just south of the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> became involved because its own 60 million Tamils were sympathetic to the rebel cause. The accord triggered a violent Sinhalese backlash. Sinhalese extremists, who belong to the <ORGANIZATION> Marxist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, said the agreement conceded too much to the Tamils and vowed to kill anyone who supported it. The Front has been blamed for more than 2,500 political killings since January. Most of the victims were government officials and security personnel.

 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved on Monday a bill to remove remaining federal price controls on natural gas. The measure, passed and sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> by voice vote, removes all price controls at the wellhead. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> would retain the power to regulate rates charged by interstate natural gas pipelines and states would retain their regulatory powers over consumer prices.

The new legislation would gradually remove controls from `` old gas,'' that from wells predating the 1978 act.

 <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said Israeli soldiers killed two teen-agers Monday, the latest victims in a surge of violence that has cost the lives of 12 Palestinians in the occupied territories in five days. <PERSON> Rafideh </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalili </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Laban </PERSON>, 13, and <PERSON> Kayed </PERSON> <PERSON> Mousa </PERSON> <PERSON> Salama </PERSON>, 14, were shot to death in stone-throwing protests during funerals for earlier victims, the reports said. Ms. <PERSON> Laban </PERSON> was killed in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Salama </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. A third Palestinian was electrocuted Monday when he climbed a power pole and tried to raise an outlawed <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flag, and a fourth died of earlier injuries. Hospital officials said a 50-year-old woman of a family named <PERSON> Ayat </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Zeytoun </LOCATION> district was killed by a bullet through the heart and a male member of the family, aged betweem 25 and 30, also was killed. A young woman in her 20s was reported in serious condition and two children aged 2 and 12 also were reported wounded. No further details were given and circumstances of the shooting were unclear. The army said there was no army activity or gunfire in <LOCATION> Zeytoun </LOCATION>. Arab sources said 10 Palestinians were wounded in other clashes. Two Israelis were reported injured in scattered stoning incidents in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. Jewish settlers in a tiny enclave in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION> said they were creating a mobile armed militia and using attack dogs to defend their houses against <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> stonings. `` We've decided to create a trained group of people that would not interfere with the army but will reach troublesome spots and help defend Jewish houses in <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>,'' settler leader <PERSON> Aharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Domb </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. `` We'll also secure Jewish houses by using guard and attack dogs, to be unleashed only in emergency situations.'' In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, a Palestinian human rights group appealed to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> to urge an independent investigation of the killings of four Palestinians during a border police raid last week on <LOCATION> Nahalin </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> rejected <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> demands for at least a partial army withdrawal as a condition for agreeing to elections in the occupied lands. `` There is nothing to talk about regarding changes in the deployment of Israeli army forces,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. `` This deployment is necessary to maintain order, and order is necessary for elections.'' Radio reports said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> went before a parliamentary committee Monday and defended his election plan against critics in his own right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc who said elections could be the first step to creating a Palestinian state. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> proposes the elections to choose Palestinians to negotiate with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` I will talk, and discuss, and argue with my friends. I hope I'll convince them that although these doubts have some basis ... we can overcome such things,'' the prime minister said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television. `` If those implementing the plan decide that there will be no <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state here, I'm saying there will be no Palestinian state.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told the committee <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> election candidates would have to agree to certain limits in advance, including rejecting a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said. He also said he opposes international supervision of the vote. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> on Sunday demanded such supervision and the withdrawal of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops as a condition for elections. Palestinians in the occupied lands hinted a partial withdrawal would be a step toward the polls. On Monday, soldiers fired as hundreds of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> youths threw stones, waved outlawed <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags and set tires ablaze during a funeral procession in Dheishe refugee camp near the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. Ms. <PERSON> Laban </PERSON> was shot in the forehead and died en route to a hospital, the reports said. In Jabaliya refugee camp in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, troops fired on stone-throwing youths after the funeral of a 50-year-old man who died earlier Monday, reportedly from a beating by soldiers, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> witnesses said. <PERSON> Salama </PERSON> died at <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Shifa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> after a bullet sliced an artery in his leg, hospital officials said. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> village of <PERSON> Bani </PERSON> <PERSON> Suheila </PERSON>, 21-year-old <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Shihada </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu-Shad </PERSON> was electrocuted while trying to display a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flag, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. The army confirmed the death of 50-year-old <PERSON> Faris </PERSON> <PERSON> Said </PERSON> <PERSON> Falha </PERSON> without commenting on the cause. An official at <LOCATION> Mukassed </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Falha </PERSON> died of spinal injuries after troops beat him on March 27. At least 438 Palestinians have been killed killed in the 16-month-old uprising. Eighteen Israelis have also died.

<TEXT>
 In 1981, <PERSON> Mallightco </PERSON> loaned the <ORGANIZATION> Wrights </ORGANIZATION> an additional $ 37,000. Over the period 1981 through 1983, the <ORGANIZATION> Wrights </ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON> Mallicks </PERSON> made regular payments on their loans from the proceeds of their other investments. However, beginning in 1984, the <ORGANIZATION> Wrights </ORGANIZATION> made little progress in reducing the outstanding principal balance and, in fact, were not meeting their interest payments. The debt continued to accrue interest; <PERSON> Mallightco </PERSON> never demanded payment from the Wrights or took any steps to collect the debt. Mallightco distributed several dividends to its shareholders in 1986 and 1987. Despite the <ORGANIZATION> Wrights </ORGANIZATION>' failure to make significant payments on their loans, the company distributed $ 59,000 in cash to the <ORGANIZATION> Wrights </ORGANIZATION> as dividends. While the <PERSON> Mallicks </PERSON> also received dividends during this period, all dividends to the Mallicks were paid in the form of credits against their outstanding debts to the company until their loans were completely repaid in 1987. On June 9, 1988, the <ORGANIZATION> Wrights </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- through the <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. Blind Trust formed in October 1987 -RRB- sold their Mallightco shares back to the company for $ 350,000, the alleged market value of the shares at the time of sale. The price consisted of $ 230,000 cash and a $ 120,000 unsecured, five-year, 10 percent interest-bearing note subordinate to all present and future debt of <LOCATION> Mallightco </LOCATION>. The Wrights paid back most of their outstanding loan balance, then $ 80,000, from the cash received from the sale. Approximately $ 12,700 in accured interest was forgiven in the transaction between <LOCATION> Mallightco </LOCATION> and the Blind Trust. It appears that the <ORGANIZATION> Wrights </ORGANIZATION> received greater benefit from their interest in <LOCATION> Mallightco </LOCATION> than did the Mallicks since the <ORGANIZATION> Wrights </ORGANIZATION> had the use of a substantial amount of cash provided by the Mallicks. However, although no effort was made to collect the <ORGANIZATION> Wrights </ORGANIZATION>' loans from <LOCATION> Mallightco </LOCATION>, those loans did accrue interest at the rate of approximately 10 percent per year and were ultimately paid back almost entirely. Although $ 12,700 in interest was not paid back, that transaction occurred between <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> and the trustee of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s Blind Trust. Special Outside Counsel assumes that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was unaware of this gift to his Blind Trust and will rectify the account with <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> when the gift is made known to him. Thus <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> ultimately paid for the use of the money he borrowed and has apparently not violated any law or ethical standard with respect to his Mallightco investment. On the other hand, we believe that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> violated House Rules with respect to his indirect receipt of and failure to report additional gifts from the Mallicks bestowed in the form of salary paid to <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> by <PERSON> Mallightco </PERSON>; free housing to the <ORGANIZATION> Wrights </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> from 1979 through March 1988; and the use of a 1979 <LOCATION> Cadillac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seville </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> from 1983 until approximately February 1989. <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> began working for <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> in 1979 as a part-time consultant for <ORGANIZATION> Mallick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Properties </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> which hired Mrs. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> to help <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> expand his real estate ventures into areas of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> beyond <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> earned $ 18,000 per year for her part-time work on a brochure entitled `` The Mallick Community Concept''; for market studies of <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; and for her access to officials and other key people in the <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> areas. Although it is impossible to determine how much time Mrs. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> devoted to her employment with <ORGANIZATION> Mallick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Properties </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, it does appear that she did identifiable work on projects arguably within her expertise which may have been worth $ 18,000 a year to the company. On January 1, 1981, Mrs. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> went on the payroll of <LOCATION> Mallightco </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> at a salary of $ 1,500 per month. According to <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was hired as a consultant to seek out new investment opportunities for <LOCATION> Mallightco </LOCATION>. However, Mrs. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, formerly on the staff of the Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, had no education or prior experience in investment analysis or financial counseling. She performed few, if any, services to <LOCATION> Mallightco </LOCATION> which has no record of any work product she created. Furthermore, although <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> testified that Mrs. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> `` assisted'' him and `` advised'' him, he could not articulate what valuable services she performed. He testified to research she did on several investment opportunities during the four years she was paid by <PERSON> Mallightco </PERSON>, but could not produce any research reports or even point to one investment Mrs. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> researched which was ultimately made by the company. Moreover, although <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> was the one responsible for making investment decisions and both he and his assistant, <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, performed services of value for <PERSON> Mallightco </PERSON>, neither <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> received a salary from <LOCATION> Mallightco </LOCATION>. In fact, Mrs. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s salary was <PERSON> Mallightco </PERSON>'s greatest expense The company frequently had to borrow money from the <ORGANIZATION> Mallick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> or other <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> entities in order to pay Mrs. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s salary. Ultimately, <PERSON> Mallightco </PERSON> could not continue the expense; Mrs. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s salary was suspended as of December 31, 1984. Thus from 1981 through 1984, Mrs. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s salary was a gift from <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Papandreou Takes Time Magazine to Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Greek Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> filed a libel lawsuit Monday accusing <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> of defaming him in a story that suggested he took millions of dollars in payoffs, his American lawyer said. The lawsuit was announced here by lawyer <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boudin </PERSON>, who said the lawsuit was filed in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> because the story was more damaging abroad than in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He conceded, however, that another factor was that it is easier for a public figure to make a case under English libel law than under American. The Time story, which concerned allegations of financial wrongdoing at a Greek bank that have rocked the <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> government since last fall, was on the cover of the magazine's March 13 international edition A similar story ran in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> edition, but it was not the cover story. The articles quoted former Greek bank president <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON>, who is jailed in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and fighting extradition to <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, as saying he passed millions from the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crete </ORGANIZATION> to <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> and other figures in the premier's Socialist government. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> has been <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>'s premier since 1981. His government is up for re-election in June, but the banking scandal and the 70-year premier's open affair with a 34-year-old former airline stewardess have hurt his standing among voters, according to recent polls. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> has denounced the Time article as part of an international conspiracy to topple his government. <PERSON> Boudin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> would ask for `` a considerable, reasonable sum'' in damages from Time, but said the amount has n't been decided He said clearing <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s name was the main reason for the lawsuit, launched only after Time failed to respond to a demand for an public apology and retraction. Time promised in a statement to `` vigorously defend'' itself. `` What is most alarming about the announcement of this lawsuit is the inescapable conclusion that Prime Minister <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> is suing the messenger because he wishes to discredit the message,'' the magazine said in a statement. `` Such a suit, just by being brought, disregards a central role of the press in a free, democratic society _ which is to make important information available to the public. Time magazine will take whatever steps are necessary to fight the allegations of this lawsuit and defend its right to report news and information it deems in the public interest,'' the statement said. <PERSON> Boudin </PERSON> said he could not recall another case in which a head of state sued for libel, although there have been a number of cases brought by highly placed public figures in recent years, including the lawsuit filed against Time by <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, the former Israeli defense minister. In that case, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> jury found in 1985 that Time had erred but had not acted with malice and therefore did not have to pay damages. In <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> need only show that the story written about him was defamatory and injured his reputation, while the magazine has the task of proving that what it wrote was true, <PERSON> Boudin </PERSON> said. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> would have to show not only that <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> wrote untruths but that it acted with malice. Besides New York-based Time, the lawsuit filed in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> names as defendants Time-Life branches in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>, and the writer of the article, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ajemian </PERSON>. Time wrote that <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> had refused to be interviewed or to answer questions the magazine submitted before publishing the article. But <PERSON> Boudin </PERSON> countered that the questions were of a general sort about government integrity and not about any specific accusations of wrongdoing by <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 The second area pursued by Special Outside Counsel was: The circumstances surrounding -LRB- Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s -RRB- intervention in a matter before the Department of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> behalf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>. Counsel reported that on September 28, 1979, Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> co-signed a letter to Secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON>, on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- `` TXO'' -RRB-. The letter provided Secretary <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> with background information on TXO and its dispute with the <ORGANIZATION> Arkla </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exploration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> over mineral exploration leases on land in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>. The undisputed facts are that Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> held no interest in TXO at any relevant time. As discussed in the Counsel's report, from February 1979 until March 1984, Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> held an interest in the Whatley No 1 well, an east-Texas natural gas well drilled and operated by TXO. However, as an investor in the well, Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s financial return was determined only by the productivity of the well and could not have been affected by <ORGANIZATION> TXO </ORGANIZATION>'s success or failure with respect to the <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> leases. Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s September 28, 1979, letter did not comment upon the merits of the dispute between TXO and <ORGANIZATION> Arkla </ORGANIZATION> nor did it demand or request extraordinary action by department officials. In view of these findings, Special Outside Counsel concluded that Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s letter was not an improper communication. The committee concurred. ...

<HEAD>COMMITTEE ACTION TAKEN IN CONNECTION WITH ITEM NO. 4</HEAD>
<HEAD>OF THE RESOLUTION OF PRELIMINARY INQUIRY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The fourth area explored by Special Outside Counsel was: Whether government resources were improperly used to complete work on a book -LRB- `` Reflections of a Public Man'' -RRB- from which he -LRB- Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> -RRB- received royalties. Special Outside Counsel reported that <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Cossolotto </PERSON>, a writer and researcher on Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s staff, testified that he spent about 200 hours over an 8-11 month period preparing the book, `` Reflections of a Public Man,'' for printing. Other members of the congressman's staff had more limited roles in the preparation of the book. In addition, Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s congressional office used some government resources to complete the manuscript, albeit on an apparently limited basis. While materials paid for by government funds may not be put to personal use, the Special Outside Counsel did not focus on this issue because of the limited extent to which this occurred. Instead, counsel examined the efforts of Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s staff _ primarily Mr. <PERSON> Cossolotto </PERSON>, in assisting book preparation. Special Outside Counsel concluded that a violation warranting further action was not indicated. Based upon the evidence and testimony, counsel did not conclude that Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s use of his congressional staff to prepare his book violated relevant standards of conduct In this connection, while no apparent attempt was made to keep the staff's work on the book separate from their work on official business, it nevertheless remains that no records were kept of hours worked on the book as compared to the hours spent on official business. This applied to not only <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Cossolotto </PERSON>, who spent far more time than any other staff employee working on the book, but the other staff members as well. Relevant testimony of Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s staff was that during the time of book preparation, there were periods during which staff worked substantially more than 40 hour work weeks. Thus it is entirely possible, indeed even probable, that although some work on the book was done during the `` normal'' 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. work day, staff employees worked on the book in addition to completing all the tasks ordinarily done as part of their official duties. ...

 Two sailors were missing Monday evening after a 652-foot freighter en route from <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> apparently sank in rough seas 400 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION>. Twenty-three crew members were rescued. The 23 sailors from the Star of <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION> were found on a lifeboat and picked up by the merchant ship Ravenscraig, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petty </ORGANIZATION> Officer <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Midgett </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` They're all in good shape, some minor cuts and scrapes,'' <PERSON> Midgett </PERSON> said. The two missing sailors were believed to be on a life raft, which was the object of a hunt Monday evening by the 950-foot Ravenscraig and five <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> search planes, officials said. The Ravenscraig's crew spotted a second life raft, but it turned out to be empty. The cause of the sinking was not immediately known, officials said. The Star of <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION> had been en route from <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with a load of cement when it began taking on water in 12-foot seas and winds up to 35 mph, <PERSON> Midgett </PERSON> said. The first mayday call went out at 9:05 a.m.. A <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> jet from the air station on <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION> and a C-130 plane from <LOCATION> Elizabeth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, converged on the ship The lifeboat was spotted around noon. The C-130 was able to drop a radio into the water near the boat carrying the 23 crew members and they were able to establish communications, <PERSON> Midgett </PERSON> said. About four hours later, they were rescued by the Ravenscraig. The Star of <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION> was not spotted, and was presumed to be sinking or sunk, <PERSON> Midgett </PERSON> said. Visibility in the rough seas was five to eight miles Monday afternoon. The Star of <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION> was built in 1966, and was registered in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. It was designed to carry bulk freight, and was owned by <ORGANIZATION> Caribene </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veritas </ORGANIZATION>, a Paris-based shipping registry. The Ravenscraig had been bound for <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, but its destination after its rescue mission was not immediately known.

 Accordingly, because it was not possible to determine whether Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> directed his staff to work on the book during time that should have been devoted to official business, Special Outside Counsel did not conclude that Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> violated any law or standard of conduct. The committee concurred with Special Outside Counsel. Central to the committee's conclusion was the undisputed fact that Mr. <PERSON> Cossolotto </PERSON>, the primary staff person who assisted Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> on the book, did not `` create'' text for the congressman. Instead, Mr. <PERSON> Cossolotto </PERSON>'s efforts focused solely on editing the congressman's words as opposed to creating and editing text of his own devise. Thus, it can be fairly said that Mr. <PERSON> Cossolotto </PERSON>'s efforts were not solicited for the purpose of generating text for Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s book but, rather, for the editing of text previously prepared by the congressman Second, and of equal importance, is the fact that there is no evidence supporting a finding that Mr. <PERSON> Cossolotto </PERSON>'s work on the book was done to the detraction of his official responsibilities as a congressional staff member. Consequently, it is entirely reasonable that Mr. <PERSON> Cossolotto </PERSON>'s time working on the book, regardless of when it occurred, did not deny the government -LRB- specifically, Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s congressional office -RRB- full value of services paid for out of the official allowance. In the light of the foregoing, the committee did not conclude that there is reason to believe that a violation has occurred in connection with Mr. <PERSON> Cossolotto </PERSON>'s or other staff activities associated with preparation of Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s book. Again, this conclusion is buttressed by the fact that no records were maintained regarding Mr. <PERSON> Cossolotto </PERSON>'s -LRB- or other staff -RRB- daily activities, the irregular nature of work hours by congressional staff, and the fact that there is no evidence that Mr. <PERSON> Cossolotto </PERSON>'s fulfillment of his official responsibilities suffered as a result of his efforts on the book

<HEAD>Rightist Party to Create Information Agency on Rebel Activity</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Vice President-elect <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Merino </PERSON> said Monday leftist rebels are `` the only generators of violence'' in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and his rightist party is forming an agency to keep track of them. He was asked if abductions and killings of leftists by right-wing groups constituted terrorism and he said: `` Not that I know of, because there is no extreme right.'' Merino of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, known as <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>, blamed rebels for a bomb attack on his home Friday that caused extensive damage and slightly injured a nephew. <PERSON> Merino </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonieta </PERSON> were not at home at the time of the bombing. Four children and two other nephews in the house were not harmed. Merino and President-elect <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> of <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> won the March 19 election, defeating the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, and are to be inaugurated June 1 for five-year terms. At a news conference Monday, <PERSON> Merino </PERSON> gave the names, addresses and workplaces of eight people he said belonged to the guerrilla cell that attacked his home. He said the information came from a rebel who was captured and interrogated by police but released for lack of evidence of involvement in the bombing. Police have not arrested the eight people he named `` because of an excess of work, for lack of resources or for lack of will,'' Merino said. He said <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> was forming an intelligence service to receive information from citizens about activities of the rebel alliance, the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. `` Our party, our local headquarters and our leaders will receive in confidentiality'' all the information and pass it on to `` the armed forces, the police and judicial authorities, according to the case,'' he said. `` People should go before our local leaders and tell them of these cases,'' he added. `` The members of our organization meet frequently and this way we can elaborate a more complete picture'' of the rebel movement `` so the people play a more active role in imposing order.'' Arena was founded in 1981 as an anti-communist group. International human rights organizations and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government linked party leaders, some of whom remain active, to rightist death squads that killed thousands of people in the early 1980s. The party denies any connection with death squads and <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> did not join the party until 1985. <PERSON> Merino </PERSON> said <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> would be only a conduit for citizen reports and would not take follow-up action on its own. He said `` security forces would definitely be the ones to take appropriate action. Arena is a civilian institution. We do not have the capacity to counter the military action of these groups.'' Merino called the guerrillas `` the only generators of violence in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'' and added: `` If we can minimize the terrorists' action, the level of violence, of victims, will tend to diminish. Leftist rebels began their battle for power nine years ago. More than 70,000 Salvadorans have been killed and most of the victims were civilians.

<TEXT>
 During the 1979 through 1984 period that Mrs. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was on the payroll of <ORGANIZATION> Mallick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Properties </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Mallightco </LOCATION>, she and her husband also received free housing from <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> just steps away from his office in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> testified that housing was provided, not as a part of compensation, but because it was convenient for him to have Mrs. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> living only a few feet away from his office. <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> could not explain why her job required her to be so close to his office. In fact, much of her work for <ORGANIZATION> Mallick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Properties </ORGANIZATION> was done in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>. Moreover, throughout her employment with <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> lived primarily in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, spending on the average only one week a month in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>. Thus her consulting jobs plainly were not jobs requiring her to be close to the office. The free housing was thus not job related, but a gift from <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>. Beginning in 1985, the Wrights began paying rent for the housing <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> provided. The rent was determined by dividing the fair monthly rental of the apartment, $ 650, by 30, the average number of days in a month. The Wrights were charged $ 21.67 -LRB- or sometimes $ 21.00 or $ 21.50 -RRB- for each day they personally occupied the apartment notwithstanding the fact that since their furniture and personal belongings occupied the apartment every day, they had constructive possession of the apartment daily. Thus in 1985, the <ORGANIZATION> Wrights </ORGANIZATION> paid rent of $ 881.50 for the equivalent of 41 days at $ 21.50 per day. In 1986, an election year, they paid $ 1,711.92 for 79 days. In 1987, they paid $ 756 for 36 days. At fair market rent, the apartment would have cost the Wrights $ 7,800 per year. Finally, after renting for 10 days through March 1988, the <ORGANIZATION> Wrights </ORGANIZATION> bought the apartment at what appears to be its fair market value of $ 58,500. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s receipt of housing at substantially below market rental is a gift from <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>. Beginning in 1983, <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> provided <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> with free use of <PERSON> Mallightco </PERSON>'s 1979 <LOCATION> Cadillac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seville </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> brought the car to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and has used it there ever since. Although the car is referred to in <LOCATION> Mallightco </LOCATION>'s records as the `` BW Cad.,'' <PERSON> Mallightco </PERSON> owned the car until approximately February 1989 and paid expenses including license fees, insurance, tires and repairs until approximately February 1989 On February 16, 1989, Special Outside Counsel received a copy of a February 9, 1989 letter to the Committee from <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Law </PERSON>, trustee of the <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. Blind Trust. Law stated that he recently discovered that: -LRB- T -RRB- he Speaker's wife, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON>, as an officer of <LOCATION> Mallightco </LOCATION>, used an automobile owned by that company. I have been informed that the parties treated this transaction as a loan of the car to Mrs. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, to be handled similarly to other loans from <LOCATION> Mallightco </LOCATION> to its principals. I have been further informed that the parties intended that the automobile be purchased by the Trust at its inception. Unfortunately, due to an oversight, the automobile was overlooked at the Trust's creation and never accounted for. Thus only after Special Outside Counsel had completed its investigation and questioned witnesses regarding Mrs. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s use of the car, Law discovered the `` inadvertent'' omission of the car from the Trust records. Law further stated in his letter:

<HEAD>One Of Three Stolen Van Goghs Returned To Dutch Museum</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL VERSCHUUR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>OTTERLO, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police said Monday that art thieves returned one of three <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON> paintings stolen from a museum to prove they had the other two and add pressure to their demand for a $ 2.5 million ransom. But the thieves failed to give further instructions, no ransom was paid and the location of the remaining two paintings _ `` Wilted Sunflowers'' and an early version of the Dutch impressionist's world famous `` The Potato Eaters'' _ remains a mystery, police spokesman Sgt <PERSON> Theo </PERSON> <PERSON> Reus </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He said the painting `` The Loom'' was recovered unharmed on April 6 in the trunk of a car parked near the home of R.W.D. <PERSON> Oxenaar </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Kroeller-Mueller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> in this eastern Dutch village. Total value of the three works taken after a museum window was smashed on Dec. 12 has been estimated at $ 100 million to $ 125 million. Recovery of `` The Loom'' followed almost a month of secret negotiations between <LOCATION> Oxenaar </LOCATION> and the thieves, <LOCATION> Reus </LOCATION> said. He said that on March 13, the crooks sent <PERSON> Oxenaar </PERSON> a written demand for a $ 2.5 million ransom in exchange for the three paintings. The letter drew no response because it contained no proof the sender was in possession of the paintings, he added. On March 22, a man telephoned Oxenaar asking, `` Why did you not respond to my letter?'' and threatening to burn all three paintings, <LOCATION> Reus </LOCATION> reported. A week later, he said, <PERSON> Oxenaar </PERSON> was mailed a recent photograph of `` Wilted Sunflowers'' that experts said was genuine, and on April 6, <PERSON> Oxenaar </PERSON> was called and told where `` The Loom'' had been left. `` They -LRB- the thieves -RRB- may have thought just a photograph was n't convincing enough,'' the sergeant said He said the thieves called Oxenaar last Monday to arrange for delivery of the ransom money, but did not follow up as promised with further instructions. <PERSON> Reus </PERSON> said Monday of efforts to recover the masterpieces, `` We have n't really found anything _ just one painting and that was given to us.''

<HEAD>WASHN: his letter:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 I have currently rectified this situation by purchasing, as Trustee, the automobile from <LOCATION> Mallightco </LOCATION>. The purchase price was $ 7,050, the value of the automobile on <PERSON> Mallightco </PERSON>'s books as of January 1, 1983, at which time it was taken to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> D.C </ORGANIZATION>. The Trust made a cash payment of $ 7,050 plus 7 percent interest dating back to January 1, 1983, for a total cash payment of $ 10,011. In addition, the Trust holds a $ 120,000 note, payable from <LOCATION> Mallightco </LOCATION>. This note has been reduced by $ 9,302.85, representing the sums paid by <PERSON> Mallightco </PERSON> for insurance on and repairs to the automobile from January 1, 1983 to present. Law does not explain how the oversight was discovered. Nor does he explain how the purchase of the automobile in 1989 at its 1983 book value `` rectifies'' the Trust's failure to purchase the car in 1987. ... Plainly, Law's February 9, 1989 letter to the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is an attempt to cover up <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s violations of House Rule XLIII, clause 4, with respect to <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>'s gift of the car. <PERSON> Mallightco </PERSON> never expected nor attempted to collect rental or ` loan'' payments for the car. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> had the car because she `` would use -LRB- the car -RRB- in connection with her work for Mallightco.'' However, even assuming that <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s employment by <PERSON> Mallightco </PERSON> in 1983 and 1984 was bona fide, there is no evidence that she did any work for <LOCATION> Mallightco </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> which required use of a car. In addition, regardless of the legitimacy of Mrs. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s Mallightco employment, there is absolutely no justification for her retention of the car after she stopped working for the company. Therefore, the value of using the car from 1983 to date and all related expenses are gifts from <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> received in violation of House rules. Of course, in order for gifts to violate House Rules, they must be received from someone with a direct interest in legislation before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. In this matter, we believe it is clear that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> had such an interest. We further impute his interest in legislation to his wife <PERSON> Marlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> is and has been a major real estate developer in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> having developed commercial and residential properties worth over $ 160 million. Prior to 1986, <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> also had major holdings in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oil and gas ventures. In 1986, he stood to profit from the proposed redevelopment of the Fort Worth Stockyards which relied heavily on public funds being appropriated by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Thus, he had a direct interest in legislation affecting the taxation of real estate, interest rates, the oil and gas industries and appropriations for the Stockyards project. In addition, <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>'s financing of certain real estate ventures through savings and loan associations and the subsequent foreclosure on at least one of those properties gave <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> a direct interest in legislation regarding the savings and loan industry. Nevertheless, in late 1986, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> designated <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> to conduct an investigation and prepare a report concerning the `` savings and loan crisis'' in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The report addressed issues of concern to <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> and recommended legislation which would curb the industry's right to foreclose on loans in default. Thus as discussed in full in Section III. E. of this Report, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> repeatedly violated House Rule XLIII, clause 4; Rule XLIV; and consideration 5 of the Code of Ethics for Government Service.

 Members of two farflung families came forward from four states Monday to claim half the record $ 69.9 million Illinois Lotto jackpot, leaving the holders of the two other winning tickets unknown. `` It's more money than any of us ever expected to see in our lifetimes,'' said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, 38, of suburban <LOCATION> Naperville </LOCATION>, Ill.., who bought one winning ticket for his wife's family <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Matlosz </PERSON>, of <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, and their four children, including <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>'s wife <PERSON> MaryAnn </PERSON>, and three grandchildren, joined <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> at a news conference, saying they would split their $ 17.5 million share of the jackpot and plan to spend the money on vacations and on the grandchildren. Another winner was <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, 36, a hog buyer from <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, who will share his prize with brothers in <LOCATION> Stafford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Chandler </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said he was `` hysterical,'' after learning he had won `` I sat at the table and laughed.'' The news got around fast in <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, a town of 300 in west-central <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, and a big sign in the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> declared `` Congratulations, <PERSON> Ron </PERSON>.'' State computers recorded that four winning tickets were sold _ two in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area, one in west-central <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and one in southern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. Both the <PERSON> Matlosz </PERSON> family and the <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> family bought 15 Lotto tickets, and <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said he was not surprised the $ 69.9 million jackpot was being shared. `` It's more money than I'll ever use,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. He said he would not quit work altogether, but `` I'll find something I like a little better.'' The Matlosz family members planned to keep working. The remaining winners were expected to come forward this week, perhaps after making financial preparations. `` Most people will have already gotten some advice,'' said state Lottery Director <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>. The final figure for the jackpot, boosted by four winner-less drawings and a frenzy of ticket-buying last week before Saturday's drawing, was $ 69,940,000, Ms. <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> said The huge jackpot, which nearly doubled in the week before the drawing, drew dreamers to Lotto outlets from around the country and even the world, as travelers flocked to Lotto kiosks at O'Hare International Airport between planes. By Monday, life was back to normal in Lotto-land. `` It's a lot slower than last week,'' Ms. <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> said. The jackpot, bolstered by a week of record sales, beat the world record of $ 61.98 million set in October in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. That pot was split among three winning tickets, one bought by an individual and the others bought by groups of co-workers. If only one person had matched the numbers, the jackpot would have been the largest paid to a single winner. But with four ticket-holders sharing the pot, the largest single winner in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history remains a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> woman who walked away with $ 55.16 million in the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> lottery in September. The winning numbers drawn Saturday were 3, 14, 32, 40, 46 and 54. Illinois Lotto players pick six numbers from 1 to 54 with two chances on each $ 1 ticket. The odds that a ticket carries a winning sequence are 12.9 million to 1.

<HEAD>COMMITTEE ACTION TAKEN IN CONNECTION WITH ITEM NO. 6</HEAD>
<HEAD>OF THE RESOLUTION OF PRELIMINARY INQUIRY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The final item addressed in the Preliminary Inquiry concerns Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s: Possible exercise of undue influence in dealing with officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. Based upon his examination of a number of instances in which Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> interacted directly, or through staff, with officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, Special Outside Counsel concluded that there was reason to believe Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> exercised undue influence in dealing with that agency. The committee did not concur. It is clear that under our constitutional form of government there is a constant tension between the legislative and executive branches regarding the desires of legislators on the one hand and the actions of agencies on the other in carrying out their respective responsibilities. The assertion that the exercise of undue influence can arise based upon a legislator's expressions of interest jeopardizes the ability of members effectively to represent persons and organizations having concern with the activities of executive agencies. Accordingly, while it may well be that Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was intemperate in his dealings with representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, the committee is not persuaded that there is reason to believe that he exercised undue influence in dealing with that agency. In sum, such a finding can not rest on pure inference or circumstance or, for that matter, on the technique and personality of the legislator, but, instead, must be based on probative evidence that a reprisal or threat to agency officials was made.

<BYLINE>ADDITIONAL MATTERS</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 During the course of counsel's investigation into the circumstances surrounding the gifts received by Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> from <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>, a question was raised regarding <ORGANIZATION> Mallightco </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s acquisition of a 4 percent interest in an oil well deal known as the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sabine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prospect </LOCATION>, located in <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. In sum, counsel found that on May 10, 1988, <ORGANIZATION> Mallightco </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, with <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> acting on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> Mallightco </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, formally acquired a 4 percent interest in the well from <ORGANIZATION> Jaffe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> for $ 9,120. Also on May 10, 1988, <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> entered into a transaction with <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rheinische </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- `` URP'' -RRB- in which URP loaned <ORGANIZATION> Mallightco </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 440,000. ... What this meant was that <PERSON> Mallightco </PERSON> received $ 350,000 cash, owed <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON> nothing for drilling and completion expenses, and would receive 1.5 percent of the working interest of the well after URP received $ 440,000 in oil and gas revenues, but <PERSON> Mallightco </PERSON> would not be liable for repayment of the loan. Soon after <PERSON> Mallightco </PERSON> executed this agreement with URP, it tendered an offer to the Trustee of the <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>.

<HEAD>WASHN: Lake well.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Drilling on the <LOCATION> Sabine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> well began March 4, 1988. The well reached total depth of 11,560 on April 2, 1988, at a cost of $ 1,256,151. The well operator, <ORGANIZATION> Brammer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, ran an electric log on that date to determine the potential productivity of the well. The log revealed the probable presence of oil and gas in a seven foot band of Hackberry sand at a depth of 11,272 -11,280 feet. Based upon these log indications, the owners of the well -LRB- primarily <ORGANIZATION> Jaffe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Goodrich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- decided to comence completion operations. From April 3, 1988, to April 22, 1988, Brammer Engineering worked to install the necessary equipment on the well to begin testing and production. The initial tests on the well on April 23, 1988, indicated flows of oil and gas in commercially productive amounts. ... However, over the next few days, testing revealed alarming declines in oil and gas production and well pressures were occurring. The well clearly had tapped into a reservoir containing some oil and gas, but because the well pressure readings steadily declined during all tests, it was also clear that the well was not a gusher. Brammer Engineering undertook numerous attempts to stimulate production in the well. ... All of these efforts had roughly the same result _ temporary stimulation of production, but the wellhead pressures inexorably dropped as time progressed. By May 4, 1988, the well had declined to a point that it was uneconomical to test the negligible quantities of gas and no oil. By May 10, 1988, <PERSON> Brammer </PERSON> had spent nearly a million dollars trying to complete the well. Despite these disheartening results from the well, on May 10, 1988, URP nevertheless acquired <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>'s 4 percent interest in the venture for $ 440,000 in the manner described above. Records received from Brammer Engineering reveal that throughout the month of May 1988, <PERSON> Brammer </PERSON> kept trying to stimulate pressure in the well and to turn the well into a profitable producer. However, all of <PERSON> Brammer </PERSON>'s efforts were unsuccessful. <PERSON> Brammer </PERSON> shut-in the well on June 9, 1988, having spent $ 2,890,000 to drill and complete the well; <PERSON> Brammer </PERSON> suspended all operations for almost two months. ... Brammer Engineering promptly decided to plug the original well and the sidetrack well and to abandon the site. Plugging operations were concluded on September 24, 1988; the drilling derrick and barge were removed; and the site was abandoned on September 25, 1988. ... Regardless of the method used to value the well on May 10, 1988, it seems clear that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>'s 4 percent interest was worth a fraction of the $ 440,000 paid by URP. While the `` loan'' from URP may well have been a gift to <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> or <LOCATION> Mallightco </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, counsel could not conclude, based upon available evidence, that any House rules were violated. During the entire time <LOCATION> Mallightco </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, was involved in <LOCATION> Sabine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s ownership of his <ORGANIZATION> Mallightco </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, stock was in a blind trust. Thus, Special Outside Counsel could not say whether Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> knew of the <LOCATION> Sabine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> transaction, the URP loan, or of the great disparity between the loan price and the value of the fractional interest in the well; nor whether URP had a direct interest in legislation. Accordingly, Special Outside Counsel recommended further investigation into <PERSON> Mallightco </PERSON>'s loan transaction with URP. The committee agreed with Special Outside Counsel that important questions remain to be resolved regarding URP's transaction with <ORGANIZATION> Mallightco </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, as well as the later transaction with Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s Blind Trust. Available evidence suggests that far too much money was paid by URP to acquire its interest in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sabine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> Prospect given that the well records indicate an unsucessful venture. Accordingly, the committee has issued a series of subpoenas to the relevant parties for the purpose of obtaining the information necessary to resolve remaining questions. The committee will take such additional action regarding <ORGANIZATION> Mallightco </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s purchase and sale of its interest in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sabine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prospect </LOCATION>, if the facts indicate there is reason to believe violations occurred.

<BYLINE>Conclusion</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 The foregoing discussion and explanation of the committee's actions taken in connection with the Preliminary Inquiry into the assertions raised against Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> have been presented pursuant to the committee's well-established policy to make full public disclosure of the results of its investigative activities While, as discussed above, certain additional work will continue, it is the committee's view that the foregoing statement will be sufficient to explain why no further action has been taken in connection with certain areas of the June 9, 1988, Preliminary Inquiry. This statement also explains why a five-count Statement of Alleged Violation covering 69 separate violations has been issued to Representative <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> regarding those matters in which the committee has determined that there is a reason to believe such violations have occurred. Beyond this statement, the committee will have no further disclosures of information or documents in this matter except in accordance with the committee's Rules of Procedure. The foregoing explanatory statement and Statement of Alleged Violation were agreed to by the committee on April 13, 1989, by a vote of 12 ayes and 0 nays.

<TEXT>
 The crash of <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> Flight 191 would have been even more disastrous if the crew had aborted a landing attempt because of wind shear, a witness for <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> testified Monday. Flight 191 crashed at <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Interntational </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> during a thunderstorm on Aug. 2, 1985, killing 136 people on board and a motorist. Twenty-five people survived. <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> sued the federal government in an attempt to force it to help pay about $ 125 million in claims by victims' relatives and $ 25 million for the cost of the L-1011 destroyed in the crash The non-jury liability trial, which recessed last month after the government rested its case, resumed with <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> presenting rebuttal witnesses. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> has blamed the crash on a microburst, a violent downward blast of air often associated with severe thunderstorms. The government has contended that plane's crew should have tried sooner to maneuver the jet out of the storm. But <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas-Arlington </ORGANIZATION> professor <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullins </PERSON> testified that if the crew had tried to abort its landing when it encountered the violent wind shear, the jet would have crashed sooner and fewer people would have survived. <PERSON> Mullins </PERSON>, who played a videotape simulating <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>'s interpretation of what the crew encountered before the crash, denied government assertions that the crew forced the jet's nose down when trying to come out of the wind shear He said the plane's nose was forced down because a head wind rapidly changed into a tail wind. `` This is what started the course of events which eventually led to the accident,'' <PERSON> Mullins </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> contends that <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> air traffic controllers and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> meteorologists failed to warn Flight 191's crew of the storm's severity. But the government has countered that the crew never sought information about the storm and that the plane's weather radar should have warned the pilots against flying into a large storm cell. Throughout the trial, the government has criticized <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> crew training and procedures, charging they have been inadequate for years. The government has also tried to portray Flight 191 pilot <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Connors </PERSON> as a habitual user of the tranquilizer Stelazine. A <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> psychiatrist testified Monday that the amount of Stelazine that <PERSON> Connors </PERSON> was taking was not enough to impair the pilot's judgment. Dr. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said he estimated from trial transcripts that <PERSON> Connors </PERSON> took only 2 milligrams of the drug every three days. The most frequent side effect of the Stelazine is a temporary deterioration in motor abilities, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. `` There is absolutely no evidence that <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Connors </PERSON> had any of these side-effects,'' he said. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Connors </PERSON> took the drug for jaw pain. Government attorneys pointed out that <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> had never treated or examined <PERSON> Connors </PERSON> and that it was impossible to tell how often <PERSON> Connors </PERSON> took tranquilizers because the prescription directed him to take them as needed. <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>'s presentation of rebuttal testimony and evidence is expected to continue through Wednesday. The government has the option of rebutting or resting. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Belew </PERSON> said he hopes to have a ruling in the lawsuit by Aug. 15.

 Nearly 2,000 students swarmed into central <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s Tiananmen Square by bicycle and on foot before dawn Tuesday and cheered demands that the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling Politburo resign. More than 1,500 students in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> also took to the streets to express grief over the death Saturday of former <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON> and to demand more democracy. Students marched in both cities Monday. They put up posters on campus mourning Hu, a liberal reformist, and expressing vague dissatisfaction with the government. A poster at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> attacked senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> for the first time, although not by name. It blamed the 84-year-old <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> for <PERSON> Hu </PERSON>'s removal in 1987. The marches were the largest since the 1986-87 pro-democracy demonstrations that led to <PERSON> Hu </PERSON>'s forced resignation. Conservatives accused Hu of being too liberal and failing to halt student demonstrations. Tuesday's demonstrations brought the revived student movement closer to a new political stage. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> students cheered when one speaker climbed on a monument to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s revolutionary heroes and demanded that the 22-member Politburo resign. They cheered a demand that party leaders reassess <PERSON> Hu </PERSON>'s place in history. It could not be determined how many demonstrators joined in formulating the demands. Most students dispersed after reaching <PERSON> Tiananmen </PERSON>, but about 200 staged a sit-in before the Great Hall of the People, the national seat of government next to the square. They presented six demands to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, or parliament, including reassessment of Hu's role, opposition to anti-liberal political campaigns, and disclosure of leaders' incomes They demanded freedom of speech and press, higher pay for intellectuals, and lifting restrictions on street marches. The six demands did not include one for the Politburo's resignation An unidentified official received the demands but said they were major matters that needed to be studied at length. The students sang the national anthem and the socialist <ORGANIZATION> Internationale </ORGANIZATION>, chanted `` Long live democracy!'' and `` Oppose dictatorship!'' and asked other students back on the campus to join them. The four-hour march from campuses in northern <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> had the atmosphere of a recreational outing. Students joked and laughed, and many said they did n't know what they would do once they reached <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION>. `` We're going to honor the memory of <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON>,'' one said. `` We do n't have any political goals.'' Several said the march began spontaneously shortly after midnight at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, which is <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leading university and has a history of political activism. Students from other schools joined the procession, along with some bystanders. Several students carrying a white sheet with the words `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s Spirit'' led the march A few police stationed around the square made no attempt to interfere. More than 600 students from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s Political Science and <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> marched to <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> on Monday and placed two funeral wreaths at the monument. In <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, thousands of students from <ORGANIZATION> Fudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> participated in marches that began Sunday. <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurpado </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, an English teacher at <LOCATION> Fudan </LOCATION>, said students sang revolutionary songs during the first march, substituting <PERSON> Hu </PERSON>'s name for that of revolutionary leader <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>. This week's marches reflected not only grief at Hu's death but also the volatility among students unhappy with living conditions and bleak career prospects. The officially supervised Student Union at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, in an apparent attempt to channel the students' emotions, set up a temporary memorial hall honoring Hu. The Communist Party has said an official memorial service will be held in the Great Hall of the People, but no date has been set. <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> was eulogized by the party as a statesman and proletarian revolutionary.

<HEAD>Dubcek Criticizes Former Hungarian Leader for Invasion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, whose reform program in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> was crushed by the Soviet-led invasion in 1968, has denounced <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s former <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader for supporting the intervention. <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> was removed as <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader after the invasion and remained out of public view for years. Recently he has been commenting on the actions that ended his reforms known as the `` <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> spring.'' He criticized former <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> in an interview carried on the Hungarian television program `` Panorama.'' It was believed to be the first time an interview with <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> was broadcast by an official news channel in a Soviet-bloc country. The official <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> news agency on Monday carried excerpts of the interview. <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> reported <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> or <PERSON> Wladyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Gokmulka </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader in 1968, could have stopped the invasion by refusing to participate He was quoted as saying, `` I hoped that <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> would finally say no to the intervention ... or that <PERSON> Gomulka </PERSON> might have the strength to do so. `` <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gomulka </PERSON> would have had to do their utmost because they alone would have been able to prevent the intervention.'' <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> was the only <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact country that refused to take part in the invasion. <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> reported <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> rejected claims by some of <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>'s supporters that he agreed to support the Soviet invasion to protect economic reforms being introduced in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> The agency quoted <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> as saying that because of the invasion the `` reform movement slowed down for 20 years not only in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> but also in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> did not say where or when <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> was interviewed. <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>, accused by some party officials of blocking Hungarian reforms in the 1970s, was replaced by <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> last May. <PERSON> Gomulka </PERSON> was removed as <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s party leader in 1970. In another development Monday, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> repealed its decision to expell four leaders who had been accused of harming party unity. The decision by the party's central control commission came two days after some 600 communist reformers met in <LOCATION> Kecskemet </LOCATION> and some speakers supported the idea of splitting away from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Two of the four who were expelled a year ago, economist <PERSON> Laszlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lengyel </PERSON> and political scientist <PERSON> Mihaly </PERSON> <PERSON> Bihari </PERSON>, addressed the <LOCATION> Kecskemet </LOCATION> meeting. The other two are parliamentarian <PERSON> Zoltan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiraly </PERSON> and <PERSON> Zoltan </PERSON> <PERSON> Biro </PERSON>, who last month was elected to the presidium of the Democratic Forum. All four have been associated with the Democratic Forum, a reform organization established in September 1987. It has become one of the most influential of dozens of independent movements in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. It was not known if the four would decide to rejoin the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> now that <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> has been removed.

<HEAD>F. Wright's Possible Exercise of Undue Influence in Dealing With
Officials of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 In early 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- the `` <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'' -RRB-, perceiving worsening conditions in the <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>'s economy and thrift industry, began a massive examination of almost all the savings and loan associations in District 9, which included associations in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> As a result, the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> discovered that many associations, especially those in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> where state regulations were especially permissive, were built on risky investments, uncollectible loans and fraudulent appraisals. While the real estate market was booming, these associations appeared to be doing well. However, when the bottom dropped out of the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> real estate market, the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s examinations showed that much of the profit had been imaginary. The burgeoning number of savings and loan failures in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and elsewhere placed enormous strains on the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> fund, which insures deposits in federal and state-chartered savings and loan associations. Under federal law, when <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> places an insolvent federally-insured savings association into a receivership, it must pay off the insured depositors almost immediately. Therefore, each closure requires <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> to make an immediate cash outlay approximately equal to the insolvent association's deposits. As <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION>'s reserves dwindled, it lost the financial ability to close even the most insolvent associations. In late 1986, approximately 250 associations required <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> assistance. Of these, <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> considered 130 associations, with stated assets of $ 47.6 billion, to be severely troubled. In response to this crisis, in May 1986 a bill was introduced in the House of Representatives which provided, among other items, $ 15 billion in new funds for <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> without the use of general revenues. The bill was referred to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee on Banking, <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> and Urban Affairs, which passed the bill by a vote of 47 to 1 without significant amendment. The bill was placed on the suspension calendar and was scheduled for consideration by the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Monday, September 29, 1986. -LRB- The suspension calendar is reserved for bills engendering little controversy. -RRB- However, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> removed it from the calendar prior to its consideration. The bill was rescheduled on October 6, 1986 and on October 7, 1986 it passed the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> under suspension of the rules. However, because the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s version of the bill contained controversial provisions, insufficient time remained to resolve the differences before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> adjourned on October 18, 1986. On January 6, 1987, substantially the same bill was reintroduced in the new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The Banking Committee held hearings later in January as members began increasingly to pass along complaints about regulators' `` arbitrary'' actions in closing down savings and loan associations. For the first time, `` forbearance'' provisions, i.e., provisions restricting <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION>'s ability to close associations, were discussed as part of the bill. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> supported these forbearance provisions as well as a reduction in the recapitalization amount to $ 5 billion. The <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> believed the forbearance provisions and the reduced recapitalization amount would severely hamper its ability to deal with the crisis. Although <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> later supported $ 15 billion, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed the recapitalization bill at the $ 5 billion level. The amount was raised to $ 10.8 billion in conference and the forbearance provisions were weakened. The bill was signed into law in August 1987. During this 1986-1987 period, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> intervened with the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> on behalf of four <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> businessmen who were deeply embroiled in the savings and loan crisis. One of these businessmen, <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, met with <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> on September 2, 1986 and informed him that the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> was out of control and taking action against him which would have serious repercussions in the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> communities. Hall is a Dallas-based real estate syndicator and one of the largest owners of real estate in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Once Hall determined that the worsening <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> economy threatened his ability to remain current on loans held by numerous savings and loan associations, he sought assistance from the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banks </ORGANIZATION> in restructuring his debts held by FSLIC-controlled savings and loans. Although the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> was not adverse to the concept of a global restructuring, it believed it could not legally assume the role of negotiator for those associations involved in the Hall restructuring which were already under <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> control. Hall was required to negotiate individual agreements with the Special Representatives of each FSLIC-controlled association. Hall was able to reach agreement with all but one FSLIC-controlled association, the <ORGANIZATION> Westwood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION>, which held approximately $ 200 million in Hall loans. <PERSON> Westwood </PERSON>'s Bank Board-appointed Special Representative, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON>, and its outside counsel refused to accept conditions to the restructuring which were adverse to <PERSON> Westwood </PERSON>'s interests and decided to foreclose on <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>'s properties and allow him to go bankrupt rather than accept his restructuring plan. At the onset of foreclosure proceedings, the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banks </ORGANIZATION> ceased communication with <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>. Hall told <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> in their September 2, 1986 meeting that he had received no response to his efforts to re-establish communication with the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banks </ORGANIZATION>. Soon after meeting with <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> called a meeting in his office with several <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> congressmen and representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, including its Chairman, <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>. Although Hall may have been mentioned, the meeting was generally devoted to passing along reports that <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> regulators were mistreating <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> savings and loans. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> called Gray shortly after the meeting to complain about <PERSON> Westwood </PERSON>'s Special Representative, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON>, whom <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said was not as flexible or understanding as he might be. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> asked if there was not anything <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> could do about that situation. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> never discussed the merits of the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s position and he rebuffed the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s offer to explain its position in the Hall matter. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> decided to further investigate the Hall matter. On Friday, September 26, 1986, <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chief of Staff <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> <PERSON> Fairbanks </PERSON> went to a meeting with <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> and his <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> savings and loan creditors. On that day, <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> learned that because of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s interest in <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>'s situation, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> had placed a `` hold'' on the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> recapitalization bill which had been scheduled for consideration by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on the following Monday <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fairbanks </PERSON> thus determined that if they were to obtain a recapitalization bill, they would have to facilitate a restructuring of <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>'s loans. On September 29, 1986, <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> replaced <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON> with another Special Representative who was instructed to disregard outside couunsel's legal advice and determine if there was any way to build a responsible economic case in support of renegotiating <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>'s loans. Following <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>'s removal of <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>'s later assurances to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> that the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> would not treat <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> savings and loans unfairly, the bill was returned to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> calendar. It was passed by the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> under a suspension of the rules on October 7, 1986.

 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee, with Democrats and Republicans united, formally charged Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> Monday with 69 violations of the chamber's rules including what the panel's chairman called `` a scheme to evade'' limits on outside earnings After a 10-month, $ 1.5 million investigation, the committee of six Democrats and six Republicans voted unanimously to issue a report finding `` reason to believe'' the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat had run afoul of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules requiring reporting of gifts, barring acceptance of gifts from persons with a direct interest in legislation and limiting outside earned income. `` I know in my heart I have not violated any of the rules of that institution,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said in a speech to a labor meeting shortly after the ethics report was released. He said he had asked `` very urgently, very earnestly'' for a quick meeting with the the committee `` to confront them, to confront the allegations head-on, face-to-face.'' While scandal has tainted other <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> speakers, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> is the first ever to be formally charged with ethical wrongdoing. At a news conference, committee chairman Rep. <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Calif., emphasized that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> is presumed innocent until the charges are proven, and he underscored that proving them requires a much heavier weight of evidence than the step taken Monday, which is the panel's equivalent of an indictment The move set in motion a series of steps in which <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> can defend himself and the panel try to prove with `` clear and convincing'' evidence that the violations occurred. That is likely ultimately to throw the matter before the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, where <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s position as the nation's highest elected Democrat could be on the line. Possible punishments range from a reprimand to expulsion from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, although lawmakers in both parties seemed to think the final decision would come down to whether <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> should be reprimanded or simply chastised for poor judgment and let off without formal punishment. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> immediately began his defense in earnest, operating what one supporter, Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, called `` a war room'' out of the speaker's office. `` At some point we've got to start figuring out who's on our side and who's on the other side,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> predicted <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> would win on the floor, `` losing a few cowardly Democrats and picking up some brave Republicans.'' The most serious allegation against <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> _ that <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> developer <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>, from whom he accepted $ 145,000 in gifts over a 10-year period, had a direct interest in legislation _ also had the narrowest margin of support on the ethics committee. According to records of internal committee votes released along with the report of the panel's special outside counsel, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>, Democrats <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> joined the six committee Republicans for an 8 to 4 margin on that issue. The panel agreed with its counsel, <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>, that <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>'s major interests in real estate and oil and gas ventures and in redevelopment of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>'s historic stockyards district gave him a direct interest in legislation on taxation and on certain appropriations bills. His financing arrangements with savings and loan institutions also gave him an interest in legislation involving the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L industry, the committee found. But <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Oldaker </PERSON>, called that `` doublespeak'' and said `` it's one of the most outrageous readings of legislative history'' he has seen. Overall, the report contains `` a lot of noise, a lot of clamoring, but very little substance,'' he said. Other matters before the committee were more clear cut. The panel voted unanimously that there was reason to believe <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> failed to report as gifts the use of a car and <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> condominium he and his wife received from <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>. Committee members voted 10-2 that Mrs. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s $ 18,000-a-year salary from a Mallick-Wright company should also be characterized as a gift, saying she did little or nothing to earn the money. The panel also voted 10-2 that certain bulk sales of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s book, `` Reflections of a Public Man,'' appeared to have been used to evade <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ceilings on outside earned income `` In the committee's view, seven bulk sales of Rep. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s book ... demonstrated an overall scheme to evade the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> outside earned income limit because -LRB- speaking -RRB- honorarium payments were recharacterized as royalties,'' <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said The committee voted unanimously to issue its statement of alleged violation formally charging the speaker with breaking the rules. Forty-seven possible violations raised by <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> were dismissed. Those involved allegations of improper lobbying of executive branch officials, misuse of congressional staff and misuse of campaign funds. Republicans were largely holding their fire Monday, aware that any attack could help <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> paint the investigation _ prompted last June by a complaint from Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, R-Ga. _ as a partisan matter `` No Republican is attacking <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Burton </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ind </LOCATION>. `` This is a bipartisan report of the ethics committee. We are taking a wait-and-see attitude. We will serve as a jury. Let's not make this partisan. But another <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> lawmaker, Rep. <PERSON> Vin </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, said the committee's release of its findings demonstrated that `` the charges are not trivial, they are not technical, they are not aimed at his wife,'' as <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> contended last week. `` These are serious, serious questions, and $ 145,000 is a lot of money.'' The report said that <PERSON> Mallightco </PERSON>, a small investment company formed by <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> and their wives, paid Mrs. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s salary even though it often had to borrow money from <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>'s own company to do so <PERSON> Mallightco </PERSON> was little more than `` a conduit for cash flowing from the Mallicks to the Wrights,'' the report stated. On one issue, the panel could not reach a conclusion and said it would investigate further. That involved the purchase by <PERSON> Mallightco </PERSON> of an interest in an oil and gas well known as the <ORGANIZATION> Sabine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prospect </ORGANIZATION>. For an initial investment of $ 9,120, the partnership bought a 4 percent interest on May 10, 1988. The well struck oil but soon played out, and on June 9, was shut down. Despite the results, a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> petroleum investment corporation, <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rheinische </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, offered $ 440,000 for <PERSON> Mallightco </PERSON>'s share on May 10, boosting the value of <LOCATION> Mallitco </LOCATION> at a time when <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s blind trust was selling its interest. An independent appraisal of the interest in the <ORGANIZATION> Sabine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prospect </ORGANIZATION> put its value at $ 69,000 to $ 169,000, far less than <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rheinische </ORGANIZATION> offered.

 <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> did not merely `` urge prompt consideration'' of or `` express judgment'' on the Hall matter as specifically permitted in the Select Committee on Ethics' Advisory Opinion No. 1. He removed the recapitalization bill from <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> consideration in order to pressure the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> into changing its resolution of the Hall matter regardless of the merits of the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s position. Such pressure is a violation of House Rule XLIII, clause 1, as interpreted by Advisory Opinion No. 1. On October 6, 1986, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> met with <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> savings and loan operator who complained that the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> was discriminating against <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> savings and loans associations and that a recapitalized <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> would close large numbers of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> institutions. <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> also set forth his complaints in a letter of October 7, 1986 which <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> forwarded to <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> asking that he check on the situations described. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> investigated <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>'s charges and reported to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> that <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> CreditBanc </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> had committed serious regulatory violations and was in a precarious financial condition. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> took no further action. Thus <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s request that <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> check on <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>'s charges is within the guidelines of Advisory Opinion No. 1 which expressly provides that it is appropriate for a member to request information or a status report. In early November 1986, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> telephoned <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> regarding <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s `` friend'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaubert </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a Texas-chartered association with its main office in <LOCATION> Irving </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gaubert </PERSON> was also a contributor to the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and treasurer of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. In January 1986, <PERSON> Gaubert </PERSON> had been permanently removed from Independent American and prohibited from operating any FSLIC-insured association. <PERSON> Gaubert </PERSON> had been involved in questionable transactions at an <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> savings and loan as well as regulatory violations and unsafe or unsound practices at Independent American. As of November 30, 1986, <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> had a negative net worth of $ 454 million. Although <PERSON> Gaubert </PERSON> entered into a written agreement removing him from the industry, he later argued that he had been misled and treated unfairly and, therefore, that the agreement was invalid. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> to meet with <PERSON> Gaubert </PERSON> personally in order to get <PERSON> Gaubert </PERSON>'s side of the story. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> protested that <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> rules prohibit the Chairman from meeting with parties to actions before the Board. Despite <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>'s protests, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> insisted that <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> meet with <PERSON> Gaubert </PERSON>; <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> did so as an accommodation to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. Following his meeting with <PERSON> Gaubert </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> made the unprecedented decision in January or February 1987 to appoint an independent counsel -LRB- selected by counsel for <PERSON> Gaubert </PERSON> -RRB- to determine whether the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> had in fact wrongfully removed <PERSON> Gaubert </PERSON> from Independent American. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> testified that but for his perception of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s influence on the recapitalization bill, he would not have appointed independent counsel Independent counsel ultimately determined that the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> had not violated any statutes or regulations in its treatment of <PERSON> Gaubert </PERSON>, although it did note some instances of improper or unfair behavior, none of which justified <PERSON> Gaubert </PERSON>'s claim that he was removed improperly Nonetheless, despite the significant concessions made by <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, at a meeting with officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> and FHLB-Dallas on February 10, 1987 in <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s office, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> made it plain that he viewed the outcome of the <PERSON> Gaubert </PERSON> matter to have been extremely unsatisfactory. The clear inference is that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was not simply seeking impartial consideration of <PERSON> Gaubert </PERSON>'s claim, but a change in the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s regulatory response to <PERSON> Gaubert </PERSON>. Such use of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s influence is a violation of House Rule XLIII, clause 1 as interpreted by Advisory Opinion No. 1. In December 1986, Congressman <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> called <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s aide, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, and requested <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s assistance on behalf of <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> of Vernon Savings and Loan in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> informed <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> that the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> was going to shut down <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> that day. He asked that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> attempt to get <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> a grace period as <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said he had a willing buyer. <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> testified that following his conversation with <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, he told <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> of <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>'s problem. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> telephoned <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> and asked him whether <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> was being closed down. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> responded that closing an institution requires a <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> meeting and he had not authorized any such meeting. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> to find out if anything was happening and to call <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> with the information. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> later informed <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> that <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> was not being `` shut down,'' but the FHLB-Dallas supervisory agents were going to seek a `` consent to merger agreement'' from <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON>'s directors at the end of December 1986. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> explained that such an agreement would not affect the association's ability to find an investor and that <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> should let the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> know if an investor were found. Ultimately, no investor was found and <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> was placed in receivership in March 1987. In this instance, since <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> merely asked for information from the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, no violation occurred. In November 1986, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> again called <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> to express his concern about the way <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> institutions were being treated by the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. He brought up the subject of <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Selby </PERSON>, the Director of Regulatory Affairs at the FHLB-Dallas and formerly the acting Comptroller of the Currency, who had the reputation of being a tough regulator and who had been brought into the savings and loan crisis by <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> to implement the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s supervisory and regulatory response. Because of his hardline posture, <PERSON> Selby </PERSON> was feared and distrusted by many in the thirft industry. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> told <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> he understood from unnamed sources that <PERSON> Selby </PERSON> was a homosexual who was sending all of FHLB-Dallas' work to a `` ring of homosexual lawyers in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> if there was anything <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> could do to `` get rid of'' <PERSON> Selby </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> refused <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s request and defended <PERSON> Selby </PERSON> as a highly competent regulator doing the tough job expected of him. Although unsuccessful, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s attempt to destroy <PERSON> Selby </PERSON>'s career based upon such an accusation violates <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rule XLIII, clause 1, because it does not reflect creditably on the House Similarly, when in late 1987 or early 1988 <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s aide, <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>, called <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyle </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s Director of <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> and said he wanted <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON> fired from the staff of the FHLB-San Francisco, such a request indirectly from <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> is also a violation of House Rule XLIII, clause 1. Thus, as discussed in full in Section III. F. of this Report, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> committed four violations of House Rule XLIII, clause 1, as interpreted by Advisory Opinion No. 1.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities Monday arrested the son of the owner of a Mexican ranch where human sacrifice was performed by a drug-smuggling cult suspected in 15 killings. <PERSON> Serafin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> Sr. of <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> was one of three men charged in federal warrants Monday with marijuana importation, possession and conspiracy. The other two were <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Fabio </PERSON>, both Mexicans. Authorities believe <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fabio </PERSON> took part in the sacrificial slaying and mutilation of <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> student <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON>, who disappeared while vacationing at the border during spring break, <PERSON> Neck </PERSON> said. The two were among six suspects who remained at large, and were considered dangerous, <PERSON> Neck </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, the fifth suspect arrested in the case, was apprehended at a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> residence by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> agents, said <LOCATION> Oran </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Neck </LOCATION>, chief <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs agent here. Meanwhile, the hunt for <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON>, 26, and <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON>, 24, believed to be the cult's ringleaders, shifted back to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> after authorities received information they had gone to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> intending to go to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> from there, <PERSON> Neck </PERSON> said. `` There might be one or two other subjects with them,'' <PERSON> Neck </PERSON> said, declining to elaborate. <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON> is a Cuban-American who has lived in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON> is a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> college student who authorities said lived a double life as the `` witch'' of the cult. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>' father, <PERSON> Brigido </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, owns <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elena </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, where human sacrifices allegedly took place. <PERSON> Brigido </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> has not been charged in the slayings. The <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> family has a long history of drug smuggling, <PERSON> Neck </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Serafin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> is the brother of <PERSON> Elio </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>, 22 _ considered one of the top cult figures _ and the father of <PERSON> Serafin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, 20. Both <PERSON> Elio </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> and <PERSON> Serafin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> were in custody in <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>. The younger <PERSON> Serafin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> is suspected of drug activities but was not believed to have taken part in cult activities. The filing of federal Mexican charges against those two and two other susepcts in custody in <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION> was delayed Monday by the discovery the day before of two bodies near the ranch, where 13 mutilated corpses were found last week. The bodies of two suspected drug traffickers missing since May were unearthed Sunday on a collective farm two miles south of the <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elena </LOCATION>. The two victims, <PERSON> Moises </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON>, 52, of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuente </PERSON>, 39, who lived on a small communal farm west of <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>, did not appear to have been tortured or mutilated like the others, officials said. The new deaths complicated the case, said <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Piedad </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> <PERSON> Arroyo </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s chief federal narcotics investigator for northeastern <LOCATION> Tamaulipas </LOCATION> state. <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> said authorities were considering adding the latest victims' deaths to the murder, kidnapping, drug and weapons charges already pending against the four suspects. Although relatives disputed the description, officials said the two newly found victims were drug dealers somehow involved with the cult. <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON>'s 76-year-old father, <PERSON> Hidalgo </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, helped police dig up his son's body. He said he first suspected his son might be buried at the communal farm after children told him they saw something suspicious there. `` They said, ` Look over there. There's a hand sticking out of the ground,''' <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> said. Across the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cameron </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> described the two newly discovered deaths as drug-related, `` revenge-type killings.'' At least three of the 13 victims found earlier have also been said to be tied to the group by the drug business. The suspects in custody have told investigators that cult members were involved in occult practices inspired by palo mayombe, a form of spiritism that draws on African and <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> influences. The suspects also said that they were encouraged by <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON> to watch the movie `` The Believers,'' which deals with people practicing palo mayombe. <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON>, charged with aggravated kidnapping by <LOCATION> Cameron </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> authorities, are believed to have directed the human sacrifices, mutilations and boiling of brains and other organs in rituals to bring occult protection for their drug-smuggling ring. Numerous people have called to report sightings of the pair, said <ORGANIZATION> Cameron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION>'s Lt. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gavito </PERSON> said.

 Artist-photographer <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrov </PERSON> said Monday he was being allowed to leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> after being refused permission to emigrate for eight years and that he hoped to go to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this week. The 36-year-old <PERSON> Petrov </PERSON> said in a telephone interview that he had tried since 1981 to join his <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> wife, <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, but was turned down for reasons of state security. Now, he said, `` I have my passport in my hand.'' <PERSON> Petrov </PERSON> said he received notification from the Soviet visa office in Sunday's mail and picked up his external passport Monday. He said he filed repeated invitations for visits to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> with the visa office long ago and that `` they just picked one.'' He replied when asked why he now was being granted permission to leave: `` I will never know. I think the reason is all the joint effort of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, and other countries like the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. But mostly it was the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s pressure.'' <PERSON> Petrov </PERSON>'s photographs were put on display at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> late last year and his case has been a priority human rights case pursued by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.

 Radio announcer <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Svejda </PERSON> once did a classical music show examining the question, `` Do composers write music that unintentionally sounds like they look?'' He also staged an interview with dead conductor <PERSON> Wilhelm </PERSON> <PERSON> Furtwangler </PERSON>, who said his absence from the living would not be a problem in succeeding <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Karajan </PERSON> as director of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philharmonic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION>, `` because he was still a better conductor than <PERSON> Karajan </PERSON> was alive.'' <PERSON> Svejda </PERSON>, 42, brings his sometimes harsh and often hilarious musical insight to radio listeners nationwide through a pair of weekly <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> programs, `` The Opera Box'' and `` The Record Shelf.'' He also hosts a daily classical music show on <ORGANIZATION> KUSC </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. After 10 years at the station, he has become a valuable property. `` He is just what radio thrives on, and that is a real radio personality,'' said station President <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. `` He's extremely quirky. In his wry delivery that sounds a bit like a lockjawed, satin-voiced <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Svejda </PERSON> explores historical recordings, recent releases, the little-known, the underappreciated and, indeed, the quirky. A piece on fat singers was described by <PERSON> Svejda </PERSON> in the program guide as, `` There's More of Them to Love: A High-Cholesterol Tribute to the Century's Largest Singers.'' A show on operatic ingenues was called, `` Not Much Upstairs, But What a Staircase.'' In another program, <PERSON> Svejda </PERSON> settled on <PERSON> Bruckner </PERSON> as the ugliest composer: `` a dirty golfball, which, when it smiled, which was n't often, suggested a badly opened beer can. Underlying his approach seem to be two principles: decry mediocrity and never sanctify the art. `` Classical music is human,'' he said in a recent interview from <ORGANIZATION> KUSC </ORGANIZATION>. `` You read <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON>'s letters and they are unpublishable.'' <PERSON> Svejda </PERSON>'s opinions are publishable, though maybe just barely. His book listing favorite recordings, `` The Record Shelf Guide,'' was published last year. Of composer <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Glass </PERSON>, he writes: `` a very nice man who has gotten very rich not by underestimating, but by completely ignoring his audience's intelligence.'' Conductor <PERSON> Nikolaus </PERSON> <PERSON> Harnoncourt </PERSON> is an `` incompetent bozo.'' Tenor <PERSON> Luciano </PERSON> <PERSON> Pavarotti </PERSON>, once great, has become a `` vulgar sot.'' Of course, since this is a book of <PERSON> Svejda </PERSON>'s favorites, most of the adjectives are glowing. In his comments literary and spoken, <PERSON> Svejda </PERSON> almost seems to be waging a campaign against <PERSON> Karajan </PERSON>, though he says that is not intentional. `` He's repulsive,'' said <PERSON> Svejda </PERSON>, referring to the conductor's membership in the Nazi party and success under <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> `` I think he's a symptom of what's happened since the war, the new anonymity, although he does have a distinctive personality. He turns everything into mush.'' Gone, too, are the days when hearing five measures could identify an orchestra. `` I do n't think it's too far-fetched to say it's a lot like airports,'' said <PERSON> Svejda </PERSON>. `` One guy flies in for two weeks, another guy flies in for two weeks.'' Conductors in <PERSON> Svejda </PERSON>'s favor include <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Rattle </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Giulini </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleiber </PERSON>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Tilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON> <PERSON> Tennstedt </PERSON>. `` They say as much about themselves as they do about the piece, which is now disreputable.'' Jet flying has also brought on `` the dark ages'' of opera, as singers burn out their voices globe-hopping between performances, he said. `` It's very depressing. I like opera, but I hate to see it dying.'' <PERSON> Svejda </PERSON> said he never provoked complaints from performers or composers he has skewered, but some listeners have responded angrily, according to <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. Some are outraged when <PERSON> Svejda </PERSON> criticizes their favorite composers. Another, during a request program, was `` deeply offended when <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> made the comment about a piece requested as being a ` piece of junk,''' said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. Other listeners were angered by <PERSON> Svejda </PERSON>'s title for a program on homosexual composers, `` The Third Sex. <PERSON> Svejda </PERSON>, who majored in philosophy at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION>, said he never doubts his critical conclusions. `` I do n't think it's arrogance. After a certain amount of time, a certain amount of experience, you develop an ear. Of course, your glands tell you a lot,'' he said. `` The fact that he really has no regard for anybody who is living is a modest affirmation of how deadly serious he is,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Svejda </PERSON> also has a profound side. Answering his own question, `` What is music good for?'' at the conclusion of one program, he said: `` It's a little like asking, what are we good for? A startlingly similar question, as it turns out, since the answer, whatever it is, amounts to almost the same thing.''

<HEAD>Youth Center to Teach Nazi Horrors Planned for Dachau</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 After eight years of sometimes bitter controversy, Bavarian leaders are planning a youth center in <LOCATION> Dachau </LOCATION> to help teach younger generations of the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> horrors that occurred in its notorious concentration camp. But deep philosophical differences remain over just how the center will pass on its bitter lessons. Politicians here in highly conservative <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION> want the youth center to be under governmental control. They envision it as a youth hostel that would combine instruction about the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> with a chance to learn about the modern-day city of <LOCATION> Dachau </LOCATION>. On the other side, an association that has members in several countries argues that the leadership of the center should reflect more diverse views and be more international in scope. The Association for a <ORGANIZATION> Dachau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meeting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> says the guest house should serve almost exclusively as a forum to analyze the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> past and its implications today. <PERSON> Juergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Zarusky </PERSON>, a leader of the association, said he sees dangers in government control. `` That means everything must be under government protection, so that the past will be presented as a formal history lesson,'' <PERSON> Zarusky </PERSON> said in an interview. `` Both the personal impact and the search for meaning for today wo n't be presented as strongly.'' <PERSON> Zarusky </PERSON>, a 30-year-old doctoral candidate in modern history who's lived in <LOCATION> Dachau </LOCATION> for three years, said his group feels unfairly excluded from the project because local conservatives fear `` this could go in a leftist direction.'' The concentration camp site, including a museum and memorials to the dead, already attracts about a million visitors a year, two-thirds of them foreigners. The site also contains watch towers, barbed wire fences, a reconstructed barracks and the crematorium where the dead were once burned. <LOCATION> Dachau </LOCATION>, which is about five miles north of <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>, was the first of a string of <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> concentration camps that became centers mainly for the extermination of Jews, mostly in gas chambers, in World War II. Official Nazi records say that 206,000 prisoners were kept at <LOCATION> Dachau </LOCATION>, although the actual number is believed to be much higher. Nazi records say that nearly 32,000 prisoners died there, but thousands of other deaths were not registered. The <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> set up the concentration camp at <LOCATION> Dachau </LOCATION> two months after seizing power Jan. 30, 1933. Its prisoners included Jews, Communists, Social Democrats, clergymen and other opponents of the Nazi regime. Bavarian officials opened the camp as a memorial in 1965, after agreeing to cooperate with the Brussels-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dachau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in supervising the site. The committee, made up of former <LOCATION> Dachau </LOCATION> prisoners, has representatives on the board of trustees of the association that wants an international youth center. The association was formed in 1984, after three years of efforts by a local committee to establish a place where young people could meet and spend the night. The plans ran into vehement opposition from the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> officials at <LOCATION> Dachau </LOCATION>'s city hall. They repeatedly have maintained that such a center would unfairly a create `` an extra burden'' on a city already saddled with a notorious past. In 1987, members of the state parliament in <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> filed several motions, seeking to take the matter out of local hands as a way to find a solution. As a result, the Bavarian Education Ministry this past September approved a plan for creating the youth center with sleeping accommodations for about 100 people, as well as meeting rooms, for both West Germans and foreigners. `` The youth guest house should contribute to enabling and promoting a discussion of the past that is linked to the spirit of democratic responsibility,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said. In its proposal for <LOCATION> Dachau </LOCATION>, however, the <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> called for the exclusion of events focusing on `` day-to-day politics.'' The ministry's <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Heger </PERSON>, who is handling the project, said the guest house is supposed to be `` multi-functional.'' `` It is n't supposed to be set up exclusively for instruction about the camp memorial, the concentration camp site, Nazism and fascism.'' The Association for a <ORGANIZATION> Dachau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meeting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> has rejected the government plan and continues to push for its own ideas, including a greater reliance on former prisoners to narrate their horrifying experiences. <PERSON> Gabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendl </PERSON>, another leading member of the association, brushes aside objections that the center could damage the city's reputation. `` This youth meeting center is a chance for <LOCATION> Dachau </LOCATION> and the people who live in the city to hear what young people from other countries are thinking,'' said the 24-year-old Ms. <PERSON> Hendl </PERSON>, a member of the leftist-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Another member of the association is <PERSON> Nikolaus </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehner </PERSON>, 65, a Jew who survived <LOCATION> Dachau </LOCATION>. `` We are n't politicizing,'' he said. `` We're discussing history.''

<HEAD>Cemetery of Ancient Phoenicians Uncovered in Northern Israel</HEAD>

 Archaeologists have unearthed an ancient cemetery in northern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and say the 3,000-year-old finds indicate the Phoenicians were landlubbers before they went to sea and dominated the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. The Phoenicians emerged about 1,000 B.C. and established city-states throughout the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, surviving until Roman times. Pottery, jewelry and other remains of their cities show a variety of influences from Greek cultures in the <LOCATION> Aegean </LOCATION> as well as ancient <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mesopotamia </LOCATION>. But little is known of the origins of the ancient Phoenicians. Evidence uncovered by a <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> team in the tombs at <LOCATION> Achziv </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s border with <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> point to a Semitic background, either from the ancient land of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, also known as <LOCATION> Canaan </LOCATION>, or further inland. The team declined to give a specific location of the cemetery for fear of plunderers; they believe artifacts and gold may be buried in the tombs. <PERSON> Elat </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazar </PERSON>, an archaeologist at <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, said the architecture of the tombs carved into the bedrock linked the early Phoenicians to the ancient Hittites, a Semitic people who lived in what is now <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and had no significant sailing tradition. `` We found a hole in the ceiling on the tomb which is characteristic of Hittite burial chambers,'' she said. `` In their cult of the dead, it was a symbolic link between the living world and the world of the dead.'' She added that the Phoenicians had a sophisicated society with advanced sailing technology, refined tastes in jewelry and an unparalled ability to adapt material from other cultures. `` There is no question they were more developed than the Israelite culture of the time. They were Semitic and close to the Israelites but different.'' The pack-rat characteristic of borrowing from neighboring societies made the Phoenicians something of a mystery, however. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a British-born anthropologist and dentist interviewed at her laboratory in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Hadassah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, said a study of the ancient human remains show the physical features of the Phoenicians were Semitic. `` This was no Greek,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, turning the skull of a Phoenician and pointing to the wide skull, arch of the nose and the high cheekbones. A cast of an Israelite skull from the same eighth to seventh century B.C. period had similar features. From his teeth, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> deduced that the man, 45 to 50 years old when he died, suffered either from fever or hunger in his infancy but was quite fit as an adult, with not a single tooth cavity. `` Apart from this hole in his head, he was very healthy,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said of the Phoenician, who died of a powerful blow to the back of his head, apparently struck by a heavy blunt instrument. The Israeli expedition unearthed about 50 skeletons from two cave tombs measuring about 10 feet by 10 feet. The cemetery covers seven acres and may contain the remains of thousands of Phoenicians spanning almost the entire 1,000-year life of their society here. Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said she hoped to use the remains, especially the skulls, to recreate the general `` Phoenician look.'' `` It will be very exiting to find out who the Phoenicians were.'' Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> uses video cameras and still photography to recreate faces. She employed the technique on behalf of the prosecution in the trial of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, autoworker convicted last year in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nazi </LOCATION> war crimes and sentenced to death. She made a video that superimposed a recent video image of <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> on a 40-year-old Nazi identity card to show it was the same man. With the Phoenicians, she plans to use the same technique to superimpose video images from ancient drawings of Phoenicians and modern sketches over the skulls themselves. `` I would be able to define a type, but not an individual. We should be able to tell how varied the Phoenicians were,'' she said, explaining that a perfect re-creation was impossible without knowing the features of soft tissue such as eyelids, ears and lips.

<HEAD>Israeli Rabbi Group Monitors West Bank Human Rights Abuses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 Two bearded rabbis recently slipped under the cover of night into an occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village to question residents about allegations of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troop brutality during an army-imposed curfew. They are members of the new <ORGANIZATION> Rabbinic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Watch </ORGANIZATION>, which is gaining prominence among the growing number of Israeli groups monitoring abuses in the occupied territories. Membership has swelled from a handful of rabbis a few months ago to 75 rabbis embracing all streams of Judaism _ the Orthodox, Conservative and Reform movements. The group's first action was to survey community health care in several <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> villages, then write to Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> complaining that medical treatment was being `` used as a means of political pressure on the population.'' `` It was immediately published in the papers and we said, ` We as rabbis have the power.' We have credibility as Jewish leaders who first of all think of the moral side,'' said the U.S.-born chairman of the group, Rabbi <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Forman </PERSON>. The group has since monitored the Palestinian village of <PERSON> Batir </PERSON>, three miles outside <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. In early April, one day before a group of rabbis was to have visited <PERSON> Batir </PERSON>, the army clamped a curfew on the village in retaliation for a stone-throwing attack on a train. Four days later, <PERSON> Forman </PERSON> and another rabbi, <PERSON> Yermiyahu </PERSON> <PERSON> Milgrom </PERSON>, slipped into <PERSON> Batir </PERSON> at night to hear the villagers' complaints. Their report of alleged troop brutality, including beatings and verbal abuse, was submitted to <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> and was carried in the Israeli press. The group includes about 10 Orthodox rabbis, with the rest of its members equally divided between Reform and Conservative clerics. It is run by a board of six rabbis that includes two representatives from each of the three movements. The unusual cooperation between Orthodox and rival Reform and Conservative rabbis, as well as the group's lack of political ideology gives it a moral authority over most of the dozen or so other Israeli movements considered to be comprised of leftists. Western human rights groups, on the other hand, are considered by many Israelis to be biased in favor of the Palestinians. `` We raise our voice, the moral voice of the Jewish spirit, which holds that every man and woman, without regard for religion and nationality, is created in the image of God,'' the group's platform states `` Invested with a religious mandate to speak for the Jewish people who has suffered so painfully, we must forever remain sensitive to the suffering of others.'' <PERSON> Forman </PERSON> criticized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s religious leaders on grounds that they failed to speak out against brutality in the occupied territories. `` We sense a lack of the rabbinic voice and when we do hear it, it's usually on the farthest right,'' said <PERSON> Forman </PERSON>, 45, a reform rabbi who immigrated to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> in 1972. `` We invite the chief rabbis to respond to what's happening because it opposes the spirit of Jewish law and tradition.'' Chief rabbinate spokesman <PERSON> Eitan </PERSON> <PERSON> Eizman </PERSON> denies the allegations, saying <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s Orthodox chief rabbis `` have responded every time there was an outstanding violation, writing that innocent people should not be harmed or beaten.'' Rabbi <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Levinger </PERSON>, a settlement leader in <LOCATION> Kiryat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arba </LOCATION> near the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, called the rabbis' criticism misguided. `` We have never agreed that these are occupied lands,'' <PERSON> Levinger </PERSON> said. `` We'll stop the moment the Arabs stop.'' The rabbis' group is careful not to endorse a political solution to the 16-month-old conflict, and it denounces <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> violence. <PERSON> Milgrom </PERSON>, 35, said <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION> `` is often seen as something that comes to discriminate and persecute the non-Jewish side, and we oppose that. It does not correctly portray <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION>. ... Man was created in God's image, every man and not just the Jews.'' The rabbis said adherence to Jewish religious tradition has also helped the group in gathering testimony. At <PERSON> Batir </PERSON>, for example, <PERSON> Forman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Milgrom </PERSON> used a method described in Talmudic religious law of comparing testimony from different witnesses. <PERSON> Forman </PERSON> said that as a result he was convinced people told the truth, despite an army denial of events described in the group's report. He said the rabbis' group also offers `` rabbinical counselling for soldiers deeply troubled by the moral and ethical struggle they confront'' while serving in the occupied territories. The group's next project is an investigation of the army policy of forcing Palestinians to remove barricades built by protesters in the occupied territories, <PERSON> Forman </PERSON> said. `` I do n't want to compare us with other countries,'' he said. `` We have to measure our behavior by Jewish standards. If we start using the lowest common denominator, we cease to be a light unto the nations.''

<TEXT>
 Amid the uncertainties of politics and a new administration, some things were absolutely certain not so long ago. There was, for example, no doubt about it: if President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was denied <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> to be secretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION>, his relations with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would never be the same. The Democratic majorities there would be emboldened to challenge him on every front. He would retaliate. Any idea of bipartisanship could be forgotten. Tower was rejected. None of the above occurred. The issue evaporated. `` I did n't like what happened,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said last week. `` So I would just respectfully disagree with the conclusion that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> reached, and I'm going to work with them. We're going forward now ...'' So far, this has not been a good year for absolutes that comprise conventional wisdom about <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> came to office after a campaign that accentuated the negative and pushed symbols in lieu of issues. Surely the bitterness would n't go away quickly. The Democrats would n't let it happen. They did, and not long after the votes were counted. They did forget quickly about their own nominee. Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> seldom is mentioned by leaders of the party that ran him for the White House. When he unexpectedly announced long in advance that he not seek another term as governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, the reaction in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was negligible. During the campaign, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made his `` read my lips'' vow against new taxes a fixture, part of every speech. Everybody knew the Democrats were going to make him swallow that line, or at least try. Forget that, too, at least for now. The president and leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> reached compromise terms on a federal budget last week. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said they had produced `` the first such agreement reached ahead of schedule and not framed in the context of a crisis.'' While it leaves the toughest budget questions to be confronted next year, it preserves at least until then the president's pledge against new taxes. That issue will be back; congressional Democrats said they will have to look for additional revenues for the next federal budget. Nevertheless, it puts another crack in conventional wisdom. `` I think if you had asked ... what the chances would have been that we would be here in agreement on a budget resolution before April 15th in the first year of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> presidency, the answers would have been slim and none,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, the budget director. Okay, but it was a safe bet that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would be living for a long time in the shadow of <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. After all, he ran largely on the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> record and on his own piece of it as vice president. He said his election mandate was to continue and to build upon the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> legacy. He promised new faces, but five of his <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> appointees came from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Cabinet. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that within six months or so, the imprint on the presidency would be his, not <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s. It did n't take nearly that long. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> seldom is mentioned these days, and that's been the case for weeks. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s name did come up at the White House the other day because of a flap over a column reporting that some <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides had been making snide comments about his work habits. As a result, Chief of Staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> was said to have told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides `` do n't get caught, you know, making jokes or being lighthearted or anything about the past. Scratch one more certainty. But do n't forget that there was no question <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would have serious problems dealing with the White House press. He avoided press conferences during his fall campaign, and his relations with reporters sometimes were testy. It pointed to tense times with the White House press. Forget that one, too. So far, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has proven the most accessible of presidents. He does n't always answer the questions, but he takes them, and frequently. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> describes his press policy this way: `` Availability, do n't get mad when they ask stuff you do n't like, and treat people as you would whatever walk of life, or whatever occupation they come from. While all of that raises some doubt about sure bets, one thing is for certain. It ca n't last.

<HEAD>Everywhere You Look, an MBA</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 They may be satirized in cartoons and criticized by their peers, but MBAs _ men and women holding the master of business administration degree _ are pervading the big business scene. While most of them still can be found at the division manager level, more and more are making it all the way to the presidency or chairmanship. Their influence is spreading laterally, too. Once found in finance jobs, they now serve in every functional area, including manfacturing, sales and marketing. They are displacing psychology majors in personnel departments. And they have made deep inroads into the steel, automotive and chemical industries, which in the past were n't known as especially promising areas for MBAs. They are now a critical mass, exerting power and influence throughout corporate life and tending to hire even more MBAs. Noting the need and the interest, the nation's universities are doing their best to maintain a supply. `` No degree program in the past two decades has grown faster than the MBA,'' says <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, professor of business management at <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, who has studied routes to corporate success for four decades. Research by <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, who pioneered studies of corporate mobility patterns in the late 1940s and wrote `` The Mobile Manager,'' suggests a large industrial company is three times more likely to be headed by an MBA than was so a decade ago. MBAs, he contends, have the drive and commitment to persist along the long route to the higher echelons of management while others drop by the wayside. Between 1981 and 1986, he found, MBAs made up 9 percent of new employees with college degrees. At the supervisory level their representation was double that. And at the even higher division level it was triple. Part of the numerical strength is based on the fact that corporations are more likely than ever to seek a college degree for a salaried position. In a sense, he says, an undergraduate degree has become a union card. As a result, those seeking to excel go after graduate degrees, and the most mobile of all double degrees over the past 20 years, says <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, is the Bachelor of Engineering combined with a Master of Business Administration. Further entrenching the MBAs is the willingness of large corporations to subsidize graduate education. He estimates that about one-third of those with MBA degrees earned them while in the employ of their companies. `` Nothing gives a mobile manager more leverage than obtaining an MBA five to eight years into his or her career,'' says the professor, among whose many volumes is `` Routes to the Executive Suite,'' which traces success patterns. Among other things, he explains, it removes the educational anonymity that sometimes surrounds an employee. It demonstrates that here is an individual who takes business seriously and is willing to make a long-term commitment. No other career group, says <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, zeroes in so intensely on big business. It is the group's primary goal. While big business might need MBAs, he says, MBAs need big business, and so, `` like a barnacle, they stick to it.'' The strong, successful and apparently enduring relationship _ and the pervasiveness of MBAs in various positions throughout the corporation _ has all but destroyed the stereotype of MBAs as overly analytical and limited. Data from 1981 through 1986 indicate strongly, says <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, that there is a much higher probability than ever before that the chief executive officer has an MBA in his or her resume.

<HEAD>Marathon Version of Ibsen's `Peer Gynt' at Hartford Stage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 At the <ORGANIZATION> Hartford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, director <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamos </PERSON> has recreated the magical, mystical world of `` Peer Gynt'' in a dazzling two-part, five-hour production of <PERSON> Ibsen </PERSON>'s rarely performed masterpiece The play, on view through May 20, is a glorious theatrical adventure, a journey that <PERSON> Lamos </PERSON> manages to make both epic and intimate. Using 26 actors in more than 70 roles, the director and scenic design wizard <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Conklin </PERSON> transport theatergoers around the globe _ from rustic <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> to a bizarre troll underworld to the sands of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to a <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> madhouse to a ship wrecked in a raging sea and then back again to <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Lamos </PERSON> does n't forget this tale is one man's story of self-discovery, from brash, self-centered, carefree and charming youth to cynical, even despairing, old man who finally finds redemption through the love of a forgiving woman. Negotiating the sweep and intimacy of <PERSON> Lamos </PERSON>' production is actor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>. He plays Peer with a fierce determination. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, who was a robust, non-melancholy <PERSON> Dane </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>'s `` Hamlet'' last year, is one of those fearless, energetic actors, willing to take a chance. Despite his eagerness, he does n't rush through <PERSON> Ibsen </PERSON>'s difficult poetry, done here in a new, very modern translation by <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bamman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Berman </PERSON> They follow the playwright's original rhyme schemes <PERSON> Bamman </PERSON> played the older Peer in <PERSON> Livui </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciulei </PERSON>'s production of the play in 1983 at the Guthrie Theater in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lamos </PERSON> saw that revival and thought about doing it at <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>. `` The play has always been sitting there in my mind, waiting, I guess,'' <PERSON> Lamos </PERSON> says. `` Every year it would come up, and we've talk about it. But after <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> played ` Hamlet' here, we decided to do it.'' In fact, <PERSON> Lamos </PERSON> said if it were n't for <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, he would n't have attempted the mammoth revival. The actor, according to <PERSON> Lamos </PERSON>, exuded `` a willingness to take a journey with ` Peer Gynt' that really did n't always seem as if it had a purpose or a goal to it. That was really the best part of the rehearsal process. We just kept looking at each other and saying, ` Well, let's just keep traveling. We are n't going to get all the answers right away.''' <PERSON> Lamos </PERSON> felt he would get to know the play better if he could collaborate with <PERSON> Bamman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Berman </PERSON> as they worked on the translation, which was commissoned by <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> Stage. `` It was a wonderful way of learning ` Peer Gynt' from the inside out and without preconceptions and not taking anything for granted,'' <PERSON> Lamos </PERSON> says. `` Literally, each moment in the play had to be dealt with very, very carefully and specifically. `` The big surprise was that we found out that a lot of the existing translations were glossing over more of the crudities <PERSON> Ibsen </PERSON> was after and more of the slang that he definitely put into the play. At first, things that we were criticizing in the early drafts we discovered were, in fact, <PERSON> Ibsen </PERSON>'s intentions. `` And that made a huge difference in the whole approach to the play. It was one of the reasons the production became more childlike and naive and began to have more of a folk quality than I originally thought it would have.'' <PERSON> Conklin </PERSON>'s settings re-enforce that theme, beginning with the opening moments of the play. The stage is decorated like a surrealistic nursery in which Peer lounges in a cradle or commands a rocking horse as if it were a galloping steed. The director and designer have created several memorable images, the most poignant being the death scene of Peer's mother at the end of `` Into the Mountains,'' which is Part 1 of the play. The mother, beautifully played as a loving scold by <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Conolly </PERSON>, is transported to her grave in Peer's cradle now turned into a sleigh and driven by her son. In Part 2, `` The Voyage,'' <PERSON> Conklin </PERSON> fills the stage with billowing black plastic which becomes the violent sea that finally washes Peer back home. The designer uses yards of fabric to cover the theater floor, creating snowy mountains, yellow deserts and green forests. More cloth hangs like a curtain over the theater's back wall, allowing lighting designer <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> to conjure up mountains as well as spectral images. <PERSON> Conklin </PERSON>'s original designs were more complicated, <PERSON> Lamos </PERSON> says. `` At first, <PERSON> John </PERSON> created a set model which was filled with large and colorful scenery,'' he said. `` We slowly took pieces out of it until we came to something much simpler and realized we wanted something that had more fluidity. That's when we arrived at the idea of these thousands of yards of flowing <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> silk and the shadows that they made behind them.'' The large cast matches <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>' enthusiasm, particularly <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON> as the vulgar, hedonistic troll king who urges Peer to `` be yourself and nothing else,'' a motto that still has a large following today. For <PERSON> Lamos </PERSON>, the most challenging aspect of the production was `` to stay open and not try to contain the play with a metaphor of some kind. I just let it be what it turned out to be, and then it began to unify itself in a funny way.'' What can <PERSON> Lamos </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> Stage do for an encore? The director is not thinking about that just yet. `` I do n't even want to browse through my drama book shelf at home,'' <PERSON> Lamos </PERSON> sighs. `` I just want to go look at the ocean for a while.''

 Mayor <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> McGlothin </PERSON>, who sings with a rock' n' roll band when he's not barbering or mayoring, dances around the chair as he clips a patron's hair and talks about Ferriday's famous four A sign on the edge of town reminds you that <LOCATION> Ferriday </LOCATION> is `` Home of <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> K </PERSON>. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>.'' The latter, of course, is the network TV anchorman. But the barbershop gossip this day is mostly about the others, the three cousins who left this <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> town of 4,000 folks and took separate routes to make their mark in rock' n' roll, country music and TV evangelism. `` There's a lot of disappointment in this town,'' says <PERSON> McGlothin </PERSON>, referring to the furor surrounding <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> who was defrocked by the Assemblies of God Church in 1988 after a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> prostitute said the evangelist had paid her to pose nude for him. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> refused a denominational order to stay out of the pulpit for a year. In January a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> stripper, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Kampen </PERSON>, made similar allegations against <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> in Penthouse magazine. `` You may not agree with him on his thinking,'' says <PERSON> McGlothin </PERSON>, a member of a clan that grew up with the three famous cousins. `` He got pretty bad down on the Catholics for a while, and the Baptists. But a lot of people thought he was a good Christian man. And I'm not going to say he ai n't `` I'm not in the judging business. God does a pretty good job of judging. The Bible says he who is without sin can cast the first stone. Well, I could n't throw a pebble.'' The woman who made the accusations in <LOCATION> Penthouse </LOCATION>, he says, `` is at least pretty. That other girl, though, she was ugly. Just pure ugly.'' The mayor-barber perks up when asked about <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, the rock' n' roll legend whose life story is depicted in a new movie titled `` Great Balls of Fire'' due for release in late June. `` I was just a tad when <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> lived in town,'' says the 42-year-old <PERSON> McGlothin </PERSON>. `` He was cocky but he said he would make it big one day. I'd listen to him rattle that piano and say to myself that I would, too.'' When <PERSON> McGlothin </PERSON> was about 21 and ready to try the big time, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> grabbed him. `` It was Christmas Eve 1967 when I got drafted,'' he says. `` Boy, was I mad. Two LSU football players and I were getting the physical. I'm telling you, these boys were big. They could knock walls down and eat nails. They flunked the physical. Me, I was dried up, 140 pounds, and passed. `` The next thing I knew, I was in the 1st Cavalry in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and they made me point man on patrol. I still do n't know who disliked me so much.'' Doing a jitterbug step around his barber chair, <PERSON> McGlothin </PERSON> sighs and concedes that even if the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> had n't intervened, he still would n't have made it as lead singer in a big-time band. `` I had the stardust like a lot of kids around here who were poor and saw how <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> made it,'' he says. `` But I never had what it takes to make it big. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> had that thing. He could make you jump out of a seat and dance. That's the thing that sells records.'' <PERSON> Gilley </PERSON>, well-known in country music circles, became nationally known when the movie `` Urban Cowboy'' featured the nightclub `` <PERSON> Gilley </PERSON>'s'' in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, outside <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gilley </PERSON> was part-owner of the club, which is now closed. The mayor's band, <PERSON> Fast </PERSON> <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> and the Partyrockers, does all right around <LOCATION> Ferriday </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Natchez </LOCATION>, across the river in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>.

 At the close of his valedictory address to the <ORGANIZATION> LaSalle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>'s Class of 1988, <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Shrubsall </PERSON> penned a tribute to his mother, <PERSON> Marianne </PERSON> `` Marge'' Shrubsall. `` On a personal note, I would like to thank my mother, who taught me my reach should exceed my grasp,'' he wrote. `` Thank you, Mom.'' The words of gratitude for a parent who pushed a son toward academic excellence went unspoken, however. Twelve hours before he was to give the speech, police say, <PERSON> Shrubsall </PERSON> bludgeoned his mother to death with a baseball bat. Instead of crowning an accomplished high school career that brought him to the top of his 250-member class, <PERSON> Shrubsall </PERSON> found himself in jail, charged with second-degree murder, and this city known for its awesome waterfalls found itself trying to understand what had happened. `` When I heard, the first thing I said was, ` No way; it was n't <PERSON> Bill </PERSON>,''' says <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartman </PERSON>, a classmate who knew <PERSON> Shrubsall </PERSON> for six years `` It still does n't seem true to me now.''

When the case comes to trial, probably this spring or early summer, defense attorney <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleary </PERSON> wo n't dispute that <PERSON> Shrubsall </PERSON> clubbed his mother several times with a baseball bat in the early morning hours of June 25, 1988. While an automatic plea of innocent was entered in the case, <PERSON> Cleary </PERSON> will likely reprise a defense he used successfully in a highly publicized case in nearby <LOCATION> Allegany </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> several years ago. In that case, <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Emick </PERSON> was convicted of second-degree manslaughter in the shooting death of her common-law husband while he slept in the family motor home. <PERSON> Cleary </PERSON>'s legal approach: <PERSON> Emick </PERSON> was the victim of a `` battered wife'' syndrome and finally snapped after years of brutal sexual torture at the hands of her boyfriend. `` The ` battered woman' syndrome applies also to other types of violence or abuse within a household,'' <PERSON> Cleary </PERSON> says. The thread, he says, is physical and-or mental domination `` in which the abusee develops almost a total dependance on the abusor.'' The Shrubsall case has elements of both physical and mental domination, <PERSON> Cleary </PERSON> says. Although <PERSON> Shrubsall </PERSON> is a sturdy 6-footer, his mother outweighed him by more than 100 pounds. The evidence of mental domination is clearer. <PERSON> Marge </PERSON> <PERSON> Shrubsall </PERSON> was always a strict authority figure in the home, according to friends, and she had become even more so after the death of her husband, <PERSON> William </PERSON>, three years earlier. Her goal for her son was academic excellence. `` We all knew how the mother pushed him,'' says a neighbor, <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Kobler </PERSON>. `` She expected him to be a whiz-bang.'' <PERSON> Cleary </PERSON> would not permit an interview with <PERSON> Shrubsall </PERSON>. But in a statement he gave police following the killing, <PERSON> Shrubsall </PERSON> said he began to rebel against his mother's strict house rules and she responded with violence. `` The more you so-call brow-beat her, the more you argue your point, the worse she gets until she gets to the point where she starts to hit me, and I mean I have been hit several times,'' he told police. `` Her hits ranged from slaps to backhands.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Zacher </PERSON>, a friend of <PERSON> Shrubsall </PERSON>'s since junior high school, says, `` He had bruises on his arms and I never really thought about it much.'' The situation grew more tense when <PERSON> Shrubsall </PERSON> entered his first serious romantic relationship, with 15-year-old <PERSON> Gretchen </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Shrubsall </PERSON> was not happy about the romance, according to a statement Miss <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON> gave police. `` She has also accused him of loving me more than her, but that's wrong because he did love his mother very much,'' she said. The night before his graduation, <PERSON> Shrubsall </PERSON> was at Miss <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON>'s house Told to be home by midnight, he was late after going back to retrieve some things he'd left at the girl's house. Mrs. <PERSON> Shrubsall </PERSON> was in her car in the driveway ready to drive to the <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON> house to get her son when he arrived, according to the police statement. A heated argument ensued inside the house, with Mrs. <PERSON> Shrubsall </PERSON> calling Miss <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON> `` a slut'' and him `` slime,'' according to <PERSON> Shrubsall </PERSON>. She started to call Miss <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON> to demand that the two end their relationship. When <PERSON> Shrubsall </PERSON> tried to stop her, she elbowed him and he pushed back. <PERSON> Shrubsall </PERSON> told police his mother then threatened to kill him and backed him down a hallway. Feeling she was going to strangle him, <PERSON> Shrubsall </PERSON> said he `` turned around and picked up the first thing and I hit her a lot of times. So many times out of fear, and then, after that, I do n't know I was genuinely scared and I was protecting myself.'' <PERSON> Cleary </PERSON> said that while some may have fled the situation, state law `` does not impose upon a person the duty to retreat when confronted with a threatening situation in his or her own home.'' <LOCATION> Niagara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON>, whose office will prosecute the case, does n't think that a defense patterned after the <PERSON> Emick </PERSON> case will work. `` I would think that's an awfully tough defense to establish, even in a spousal situation, never mind a mother and son,'' he says. <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON> called <PERSON> Shrubsall </PERSON>'s statement to police `` loaded with self-serving declarations.'' While he said he could `` see a lot of background circumstances which probably dictated his conduct,'' they are not enough `` to justify his actions.'' While both sides say there has been no attempt at plea-bargaining, second-degree manslaughter charges were added in a second grand jury indictment, possibly setting up a situation where <PERSON> Shrubsall </PERSON> might plead guilty to lesser charges. <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON> says plea-bargaining is discussed in almost every case but, `` Frankly, I have a lot of difficulty with that at this point.'' That's because a manslaughter plea would make Shrubsall eligible for youthful offender status, he says, `` and that minimizes the penalties significantly. The maximum then becomes nine years as opposed to 25.'' But <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON> also realizes the problems of trying a defendant who even the police have called an all-American type with no previous record. `` Sometimes it's easy, it's clear-cut,'' said <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON>. `` A lot of times it's not very easy, and in this case, it's difficult.''

 It's called the Snow Train or the Moose Meat Special, depending on the time of year and the interests of its passengers, and for tourists it's a way to pierce the wilds of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> without severe damage to the household budget.

 The train is highballing through an awesome crack in the Earth's surface, on a scenic journey to nowhere and back. Inside the no-frills passenger cars, steam heat and the morning sun fog the wide windows. A bored kid punches his sister in the arm. She wails. Their grandmother is preoccupied with the vista outside the window, pristine soft snow and black rock, snow so deep it reaches the roofs of fishing cabins. In the dining car, a young couple from <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> asks if they can get American bacon instead of Canadian bacon with their eggs. Three happy-go-lucky guys lurch down the aisle without spilling a drop from their open cans of beer. All had crossed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> border at <LOCATION> Sault </LOCATION> Ste. <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> and bought a $ 35 ticket for an eight-hour, round-trip train ride through the Canadian wilderness to <PERSON> Eaton </PERSON> 120 miles to the north. Ninety years ago, the <ORGANIZATION> Algoma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railway </ORGANIZATION> first pierced the Canadian hinterland. It was built to bring iron ore out of <LOCATION> Wawa </LOCATION> and timber out of <ORGANIZATION> Hearst </ORGANIZATION>. Then it was discovered by artists, sportsmen and tourists, who know it by such names as the Snow Train or the Moose Meat Special, depending on the time of year. Business is brisk in the snowbound winter, gets even better during the spring and summer. Today, <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dassance </PERSON> was riding the rail with her daughter's family, the seven of them among the hundreds of Americans who take <ORGANIZATION> Algoma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION>'s weekend tour each year A local makes regular stops along the way during the week, but on the weekend sightseeing run there are no stops. No depots. Just ride to the end of the line, get up, turn your seats around and ride back. `` My husband did n't come,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dassance </PERSON> says. `` He said he had enough snow back in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>.'' Outside, a cold wind rips through <LOCATION> Agawa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION>, tearing at the rock walls with ice crystals, further eroding this wild, open cut in the Earth's skin. The Agawa Canyon has been molded by erosion and sculpted by glacier. Up close, it is a narrow cleft in the dark, gray rock through which a river tumbles and the railroad runs. Giant pressures thrust up granite mountains so long ago the range has eroded to its jutting, broken spine. Volcanic fissures shot up veins rich with minerals: gold, iron, phosphate, silica sand. It takes a satellite to show the gorge's true nature _ a 90-mile north-south crack in the planet, says <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Frey </PERSON>, a staff geologist for <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> and Mines. `` The rail line follows a natural weakness in the Earth's crust. It's a major fault.'' Agawa means `` sheltered place'' to <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>'s people, the <LOCATION> Ojibwa </LOCATION>. From <PERSON> Michipicoten </PERSON> <PERSON> Harbour </PERSON>, near the rail's midpoint, Stone guides American hunters and tells black bear legends handed down from his father and grandfather. Stone's stories also include a topical account of the 1850 treaty his people signed with the Crown, giving away land that 30 years later was granted to the railroads to open up <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>. The mining and timbering produced small towns along the track _ <ORGANIZATION> Hawk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Junction </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Batchawana </LOCATION>, Searchmont _ but so much of the territory remains a wilderness that game hunters ride in by rail, shoot their quarry and then flag down the train for the ride back. In October, moose season, the <ORGANIZATION> Algoma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railway </ORGANIZATION> adds cars to carry the quarry. They call it the Moose Meat Special, but moose is n't the only meat on board. `` I've seen bear ride the train, too,'' <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> says. You could get there by road, in many places, but that loses the romanticism, he says. There was no road beyond <LOCATION> Batchawana </LOCATION> when the <ORGANIZATION> Algoma </ORGANIZATION> line attracted its first train tourists _ a band of rebel Canadian artists called the Group of Seven. In 1918, some of these radical artists hopped a caboose in <LOCATION> Sault </LOCATION> Ste. <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> to ride into the wild <ORGANIZATION> Algoma </ORGANIZATION>. They shunted from siding to siding, sketching the strong land with wild Picasso skies on the inside covers of their cigar-box palettes. The art world laughed but the Seven prevailed. They would become some of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s most famous artists. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> understands what drew the Seven. At 66 and retired from <ORGANIZATION> Algoma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> is starting a career in art, following the path laid by the Seven and mapped personally for him. `` I have been in the area,'' he says. `` I have stood in the spot where J.E.H. <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> did ` The Solemn Land.' You can feel it.'' Decades after the train trips, <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>'s sister-in-law rented a summer cottage to a returning member of the Seven, A.Y. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> was born to the land but he never saw it as `` the rich, strong North'' until <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> showed him how. `` He opened my eyes,'' <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> says. To <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Algoma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railway </ORGANIZATION> is more than art and recreation. It is commerce. <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, a vice president of the company, says the railroad last year moved 1.4 million tons of iron ore, limestone and coke. The railroad carried an additional 1 million tons of manufactured products such as steel and almost half as much timber and wood pulp, he says. But there is a shadow across Black's figures. Eighty percent of the railroad's life comes from freight traffic. The biggest hunk _ as much as 57 percent _ is jeopardized by <ORGANIZATION> Algoma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION>'s talks of closing the <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> MacLeod </PERSON> iron ore mine in <LOCATION> Wawa </LOCATION>. It not only is the only producing iron ore mine on the line, but it is also the very mine the <ORGANIZATION> Algoma </ORGANIZATION> railroad was built to serve in 1899. At <LOCATION> Eton </LOCATION>, 120 miles from <LOCATION> Sault </LOCATION> Ste. <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> -LRB- the Soo -RRB-, the tourist train stops. The seats are reversed and the tour starts back. Passengers fell asleep in the warm sun of late afternoon, rocked by the sway of the train. <PERSON> Margo </PERSON> <PERSON> Downing </PERSON> grabs some peace in a cup of coffee and a cigarette and vows she is going to quit her job as train tour guide. `` I used to enjoy this,'' she says. `` But there are some days when nobody's happy.'' She looked out the window at the spectacular view, the frozen waterfalls, the jagged cliffs. `` I know I'll miss this,'' she says. `` It's the one thing I'll really miss.''

 <PERSON> Lovejoy </PERSON>, you see, is this sometimes shady antique dealer who is always broke, a know-it-all sleuth with an eye for women who almost always have an eye for him. He's also a knight errant in setting right challenges that range from murder to the plight of a stutterer. Needless to say, he is always in trouble, which is the trademark given him by his creator, the ebullient English author, <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gash </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gash </PERSON> acknowledges that his dozen books that feature <PERSON> Lovejoy </PERSON> abound in plots and subplots that defy the most analytic reader. `` The Swedes, who measure such things, say there are an average of 4 -LCB- major plots and 13 minor plots per book,'' he says. `` They say the usual is two major plots and three subplots.'' Gash does n't plan his stories that wses, on the faculty of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tropical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> and a visiting professor at half a dozen <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> universities. When he was in medical school and needing money, he recalls, `` I got a job in <LOCATION> Petticoat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lane </LOCATION>. ... It was an antiques market in those days. `` The Cockney antique dealers were angels. I feel like sending them my M.D. sometimes. They kept me alive. They paid me for the work I did and never saw me go hungry. As soon as they knew I was a medical student they could n't do enough. With that and a couple of night jobs, I made my way through college.'' It was in <PERSON> Petticoat </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> that the doctor-in-training got his pen name, Gash. `` If you go among street markets in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it's one of the commonest words you'll hear,'' he says. `` It means good for nothing. It has a bit of a joke in it. I could n't find another author whose name was Gash. It's the same initial as my name. And it's one I could remember.'' He married <PERSON> Pam </PERSON>, a nurse, when he was 21. `` <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> was affluent,'' <PERSON> Gash </PERSON> says. `` She had 7 pounds in the bank. I'd never seen so much money in my life. We lived in a garret, really. It did n't seem especially brave.'' Gash reports gleefully that two of their three daughters are married to actors named <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> and the other says with her luck she'll marry <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. The Gashes have two grandchildren. A third is expected on July 4. Since writing `` The Judas Pair'' in 1977, Gash works without an outline and sometimes has more than one book under way at once. `` I do n't know how to write a book,'' he says. `` I write everything longhand, very small lines very close, on sheets of paper. `` It's like a jigsaw. I may write chapter 19 first. I do n't know how to plan a novel or how to bring in a new character unless it just comes. I never know what is going to be in my mind. `` When I've done it all, I rewrite it over the original in a different color ink _ red. Then blue and green, until finally it looks like a map of the underground. Then I send it off to the typist. Then I do the same thing again to the typescript _ black, red, blue, green. It's indecipherable. ` Gold by <PERSON> Gemini </PERSON>' took 13 rewrites. The fewest rewrites was ` The Vatican Rip,' which took seven.'' Gash's latest book `` Jade Woman,'' published by <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, is set in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> where Gash and his family lived in the 1960s and where he was director of clinical pathology at <ORGANIZATION> Queen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> and working in infectious diseases at Hey Ling Chau leper colony `` Jade Woman'' may be the book that makes him a household-name like fellow Brits P.D. <PERSON> James </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Francis </PERSON>, although he finds fame embarrassing. `` I suppose it is the guilt of laying aside your medical work for a while, even if it's an hour a day,'' he says. `` I find that very painful. You go to a clinic, see several patients dying. By way of light relief, you write something. There is deep within you the feeling, ` Look here, you've stopped working. Instead you're scribbling inanities about some shoddy antique dealer. `` I know it's a human being's way of pacing himself. An executive who makes major decisions goes out and plays golf. This is my game. `` I feel like an intruder into the whole literary scene. If I had the time I would go to <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION> and do a degree in English lit. Think how marvelous that must be. We go to medical school. Six years later we emerge, blinking at the light, never having seen anybody but doctors and patients. We're highly trained. We're not educated. There's something a wee bit wrong about that.''

 Unlike many actors who are eager to leave old series characters behind, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Falk </PERSON> readily admits he is happy to be back playing `` Columbo.'' <PERSON> Falk </PERSON> feels comfortable as the rumpled, ruminating detective he created in the original series that ran on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> from 1971 to 1977. He won three Emmy awards as best actor for the role. `` Columbo'' is now a part of the `` ABC Mystery Movie'' lineup. `` I was sorry it went off the air the last time,'' says <PERSON> Falk </PERSON>, sitting on a stool by an easel in the art studio behind his <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> home. `` I think there's still a lot of life left in that character. I think it'll be a terrific character to see grow old. It'll be fun to see him creaking around. `` I do n't think his emotional appeal has anything to do with age. I think he'll be even funnier as he grows old. ` I do n't feel well, sir. Sorry, forgive me, it takes me a while to get up these steps.''' As he talks, <PERSON> Falk </PERSON> squirms on the stool. He screws up his face. His brows knit. He suddenly smiles. He throws back an arm to scratch his head. His shirt rises up to reveal his bare belly. It's like watching <PERSON> Columbo </PERSON> go through his routine. Here, it's merely fun to watch <PERSON> Falk </PERSON> On the screen, <PERSON> Columbo </PERSON>'s mannerisms are calculated to make the suspect underestimate him. He may put the suspect off guard or make him so exasperated he makes a mistake. The art studio is devoted to <PERSON> Falk </PERSON>'s work as a charcoal artist. He also works in pencil and in black and sepia crayons in a turn-of-the-century French style. On the easel and around the studio are examples of his drawings of the female figure. They are reminiscent of <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Degas </PERSON>' `` ballet girl'' sketches. `` I've been drawing about 13 years,'' <PERSON> Falk </PERSON> says. `` But it's not how long you've been doing it, but how often. I'd rather do nothing but draw for two years straight than dabble for 13 years.'' <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> May </PERSON>, his sometime collaborator on films, told <PERSON> Falk </PERSON> that she saw <PERSON> Columbo </PERSON> as `` a backward <PERSON> Sherlock </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>.'' `` <PERSON> Sherlock </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> had a long neck,'' he says. `` Columbo has a short, thick neck. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> was an aristocrat. Columbo is from the streets. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> smoked a meerschaum pipe. Columbo smokes 35-cent Italian cigars. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> was an elegant dresser. I ca n't find the words to describe Columbo's wardrobe. `` What they have in common is an insatiable curiosity, a fierce logic, flashes of intuition and an innate sense about human behavior. They are helpless victims of their own obsessions. They have to find out, they have to know what really happened. They are both cerebral rather than physical. Columbo ca n't stand guns or the sound of gunfire. He does n't even carry a gun. He's got too many papers in his pockets.'' `` Columbo'' was created by two of television's foremost practitioners of crime, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Link </PERSON> and the late <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Levinson </PERSON>. The character made his first appearance on a summer mystery show with <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Freed </PERSON> in 1960. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> was <PERSON> Columbo </PERSON> in a stage play, `` Prescription: Murder,'' that later became the first Columbo movie in 1968. <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cobb </PERSON> reportedly turned down the role before it went to <PERSON> Falk </PERSON>. <PERSON> Falk </PERSON> believes <PERSON> Columbo </PERSON>'s lack of pretension and his `` comfort in his own skin'' give him an appeal. `` He's a genuinely polite man, not to say he's not canny,'' he says. `` It's hard for me to know when he actually forgets or when he's abstracted. He has a kind of misty quality. He's aware of how to hound somebody and how to get to them. He knows how to play his hand and hold back his ace. `` People enjoy seeing how he's going to catch the suspect. It's a cat and mouse game It's that aspect where <PERSON> Columbo </PERSON> and the villain are both saying that I know you know that you know that I know.'' In a recent show Columbo came up against an authority on sex played by <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> <PERSON> Crouse </PERSON>. She was a writer and host of a radio show with an open and approving attitude toward contemporary sexual standards. Columbo possesses old-fashioned romantic ideas about sex. It made for a tantalizing match. In 1979, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> attempted to capitalize on `` Columbo'' by doing a spinoff starring his wife. <PERSON> Columbo </PERSON> frequently referred to his wife, but she was never seen. <PERSON> Falk </PERSON>'s idea of Mrs. <PERSON> Columbo </PERSON> was that she was a homebody surrounded by children. But `` Kate Loves a Mystery'' introduced a young, beautiful and stylish Mrs. <PERSON> Columbo </PERSON> played by <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulgrew </PERSON>. The show was a dud, and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> quickly changed her name to <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON> to erase any reference to Lt. Columbo. The show was still a disaster and was gone by the end of the year. `` I never approved of showing her,'' <PERSON> Falk </PERSON> says. `` That way everyone could have his own idea of what she was like. Columbo's a storyteller. He makes frequent references to children and nephews. When he does n't want to reveal where he learned a piece of information he'll say someone in his family told him.''

 Little things bring home the reality of starring in a big Broadway play. People on the bus who ask, `` Did I go to high school with you?'' or `` Did you live in my mother's apartment building?'' Or the persistent gaze of strangers who give you the kind of stares that mean they either want to steal your purse or congratulate you on your performance. Such are the problems facing actress <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, who now has her name above the title in <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wasserstein </PERSON>'s hit comedy, `` The <PERSON> Heidi </PERSON> <PERSON> Chronicles </PERSON>.'' `` I try to be nice to people, but it makes me embarrassed,'' says the quiet, almost shy <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, relaxing in her tiny dressing room backstage at the Plymouth Theater. `` Especially when they say ` Where do I know you from?' And then you have to stand there and say ` I did this and I did that' and listen to them say, ` No, No. No.' And finally, ` Oh, that's it!'' For <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, the Plymouth Theater has become something of a permanent home. She was there last season in <PERSON> Lanford </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s `` Burn This.'' She won a Tony Award as best actress for her portrayal of a grieving dancer mourning the death of her roommate. Now she is back with `` The <PERSON> Heidi </PERSON> <PERSON> Chronicles </PERSON>,'' which won the 1989 Pulitzer Prize for drama. In it, she plays art historian <PERSON> Heidi </PERSON> <PERSON> Holland </PERSON>, a witness to 20 years of changing attitudes toward women in modern <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Heidi </PERSON> is a very complicated character,'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> says. `` The more I've done the play, the more I've learned about her.'' And she has had time to get acquainted with <PERSON> Heidi </PERSON>. The play began last December at off-Broadway's Playwrights Horizons, a small but important <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> company where such works as `` Sunday in the Park with <PERSON> George </PERSON>'' and `` Driving Miss Daisy,'' two other recent Pulitzer Prize winners, got their start. `` <PERSON> Heidi </PERSON> may not get involved, but she takes everything very personally,'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> says. `` She feels things deeply and sticks to her own path. Because she does n't rail at the winds, people find her to be some sort of a pushover. I do n't find her to be that passive.'' The play follows <PERSON> Heidi </PERSON> from the late'60s and the era of Vietnam War protests to the late'80s when the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> era has come and gone and the dreams of the baby boomers have begun to burst. The 32-year-old <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> came of age some seven or eight years later than the character she plays on stage. And with less turbulence. The actress is from <LOCATION> Rochelle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, some 80 miles west of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Her father, now retired, ran a gas station. `` It's farm country _ corn fields and soybeans,'' she says. `` It was very quiet and a great way to grow up. I was allowed to be a kid forever.'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> first went to <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> where as a freshman she studied drama and met <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Malkovich </PERSON>, a junior. The following year <PERSON> Malkovich </PERSON> transferred to <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and linked up with people like <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinise </PERSON>, <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinney </PERSON> and <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Metcalfe </PERSON>. Out of this group of young drama students came the <ORGANIZATION> Steppenwolf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>. After college, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> joined the fledgling company which had found a home in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Highland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. To earn money, she kept a full-time job as a secretary for an educational film company. `` My experiences are n't like those of a lot of other actresses,'' she says of her early days. `` With Steppenwolf, I had a ready-made family. I would know what show I was doing, and I almost never auditioned during the entire seven years I lived in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. We read for parts among ourselves. It created a lot of security. We did n't have to keep proving ourselves.'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> kept her job as a secretary even when she was doing eight shows a week at <LOCATION> Steppenwolf </LOCATION>. Only when she came to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in 1983 with a <LOCATION> Steppenwolf </LOCATION> production of `` And a Nightingale Sang'' did she quit outside work. The success the previous year of <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON>'s `` True West,'' starring <PERSON> Malkovich </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sinise </PERSON>, made the move to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> easier for other <LOCATION> Steppenwolf </LOCATION> members. `` Until then, I had never been to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> _ not even to visit,'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> says. `` It was the right time in my life. I was in my late 20s, and it was a good role for me. Again I came with a <LOCATION> Steppenwolf </LOCATION> show, so there was a sort of built-in security.'' In `` Nightingale,'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> played a shy, crippled English spinster. From the show, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> got an agent, rave reviews and a six-month run. She decided to stay in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and won a part in <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Durang </PERSON>'s comedy `` The Marriage of <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> and Boo,'' as well as movie roles in such films as `` Peggy Sue Got Married,'' `` Manhunter'' and `` Tucker.'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> teamed up with <PERSON> Malkovich </PERSON> for a year-long run in `` Burn This,'' which first played <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, then <LOCATION> Steppenwolf </LOCATION>'s theater in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and finally <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The month that `` Burn This'' opened on Broadway in 1987, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> did a reading for `` The Heidi Chronicles.'' It was an early draft of the play, but <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> immediately knew she wanted to play <PERSON> Heidi </PERSON> when the comedy was done on stage. She got her wish. For the next six months or so at the <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> will concentrate on <PERSON> Heidi </PERSON>, refining the character. `` When we started rehearsals, <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> would drop telling comments about the kind of woman <PERSON> Heidi </PERSON> was and then I would use my imagination,'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> says. `` We also sat in on some art history lectures and talked to different art historians.'' The actress also met with well-known feminist art historian <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Nochlin </PERSON> who teaches at the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>. She attended <PERSON> Nochlin </PERSON>'s graduate class and read her essay, `` Why are there no famous women painters?''. Still, the actress does n't know if her portrait of <PERSON> Heidi </PERSON> <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> will ever be complete. `` That's what is so good about the theater,'' she says. `` It's an alive art form You keep working on something and hopefully, the more you do it, the better you get at it.''

 For the first time in nearly 20 years, Chileans will elect a president this year to replace an iron-fisted military leader. But it could be too early for rejoicing. This is another in a series of periodic reports by The Associated Press on the economic, social and political turbulence that has turned <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> into a continent in crisis.

 Lame ducks though they may be, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s military leaders already are casting an ominous shadow over the civilian government that will take office next year They have made it unabashedly clear that while they will step aside they wo n't step out and will seize power again if they think it is necessary. And therein lies a major difficulty for the civilian who wins the presidential election Dec. 14 and takes over March 11 from Gen. <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, the iron-fisted president since 1973. The military government will bequeath a growing and stable economy to the civilians, but they also will leave deep and potentially explosive social imbalances. Millions of Chileans are still poor _ as they were when <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> led the military into the civilian disarray of September 1973 and overthrew President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, the Marxist who professed to want to help the poor. Recent opinion polls indicate that while Chileans have a relatively robust economy, low salaries and unemployment are high on their list of priorities for the civilian government. As politicians prepare for the election, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> and other military leaders make it clear they do not plan a complete retreat from the political scene. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> recently said military leaders have the obligation to ensure that the future civilian president is `` an authentic democratic man.'' And the military is on record that it wo n't hesitate to intervene again. `` If the institutional order is broken, the armed forces have the duty to restore it, using compulsion and all the necessary means,'' Gen. <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Medina </PERSON>, head of a center of strategic studies, said in a recent lecture to non-commissioned officers. Civilian politicians complain that will place the armed forces in the role of `` armed guardians'' of the civilian government. A constitution drawn up by the military government in 1980 gives the armed forces the means for such a role. It allows <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, who still commands the army, and the commanders of the navy, air force and national police to keep their posts until 1998. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, who is constitutionally prohibited from seeking re-election in December, has already said he will remain as army commander after the election. That is tantamount to `` creating an armed state within an unarmed democratic state,'' said <PERSON> Genero </PERSON> <PERSON> Arriagada </PERSON>, vice president of the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the largest in the opposition. The constitution also established a military-dominated <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which may `` represent'' its views to the civilian government on key matters. More complicated for the future leaders may be the problem of human rights violations during 16 years of military rule. Opposition leaders say that should they win the election, they will investigate the abuses and try those found responsible. The military leaders have made it clear, however, they it will not permit reprisals for what they see as actions that were part of a war. In the military years, thousands of leftists were arrested, many were sent into exile and hundreds were killed. Local and foreign human rights groups have documented more than 700 cases of dissidents who disappeared after being arrested by security forces. A recent opinion poll taken by the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, an independent research institute, however, indicates that Chileans are more interested in their personal economic situations than in the political complexities of the process to restore civilian rule or in the military threats to take power again. In a nationwide poll taken by the center in March and April, 46 percent of the respondents mentioned low salaries and inefficient public health services as the two top items on a civilian government's agenda.

<TEXT>
 Turkish yuppies in bluejeans and miniskirts sip coffee at a fashionable waterside cafe on the Bosporous, seemingly oblivious of the Moslem faithful bent in sabbath prayers in a mosque just a few feet away. <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> is a country of such contrasts. <LOCATION> Istanbul </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ankara </LOCATION>, the centers of commercial, intellectual and parliamentary life, feature glittering Hiltons, shopping centers and traffic-clogged streets, while an hour's flight away are the horse-drawn carts and souks of <LOCATION> Diyarbakir </LOCATION> in the far east where politics are often inflamed by blood feuds. With one foot in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the other in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> yearns to be a part of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> but also feels the pull _ and bears the vestiges _ of the East. Its armies reached the gates of <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> three centuries ago but were beaten back in what was the start of the decline of the Ottoman Empire. Today <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> seeks to enter <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> peacefully, bidding for membership in the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- EEC -RRB-, the symbol of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> democracies' economic and political clout. It would fulfill the dream of <PERSON> Kemal </PERSON> <PERSON> Ataturk </PERSON>, the revered father of modern <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, who put the overwhelmingly Moslem country on a Westward bent by turning away from Islamic law to build a republic based on separation of church and state in 1923. Turkish officials believe they have already paid their dues for admission to the West by fighting alongside <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and by membership in <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, protecting a land border with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. But the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> bid is seen as the acid test. `` It's one of the few subjects in which there's more or less a consensus in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Inal </PERSON> <PERSON> Batu </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. He acknowledged, stressing <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s dilemma, that some Europeans think the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> `` is a club for Christians.'' Says <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Karper </PERSON>, general manager of <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Istanbul </LOCATION> and an American: `` Europeans have to become familar with <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>.'' But Turks, too, have become increasingly wary of signs of a rise of Islamic fundamentalism, which has seen women marching in the streets covered head to toe and strained <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s relations with neighboring <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. That, coupled with a history of military interventions to topple democratic governments and charges that torture in prisons persists, raises questions about how solid Western foundations are. On the other hand, since the military returned to the barracks in 1983, Premier <PERSON> Turgut </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> has taken giant steps in shaping a <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> of the late 20th century. New airports, highways and power grids have gone up around the country, bringing electricity and direct-dial telephone service to remote mountain villages in the east. Vast housing projects are being built, replacing the `` gecekondu'' -LRB- meaning `` built overnight'' -RRB-, the shantytowns that gave <LOCATION> Ankara </LOCATION> and other cities a Third World look. Bankers are high on <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> as a safe place for foreign investment and cite its large domestic market and food resources. `` When you can feed people, they have more patience,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION>'s Karper. On the drawing board is a vast project to irrigate the barren southeast Anatolian plain, near <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s borders with <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, to further exploit <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s rich agricultural potential and stem the flow of peasants to the cities in search of work. In other words, development in a rush not only to get <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> on the European track but also to provide for a fast-growing population now at 55 million. But Turks, and now <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> himself, have paid a price for this. <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON>'s liberal economic policies aimed at forcing Turkish industries to compete on European terms and heavy public spending have spurred economic growth but also triggered inflation running as high as 75 percent that has impoverished many Turks. This in a country where school teachers and other civil servants earn as little as $ 100 a month without wage indexing to protect against inflation so dear to <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s Socialist economies. Voters punished <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> in nationwide local elections in March, sending his governing <ORGANIZATION> Motherland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to a humiliating third place in the polls. But others factors were also blamed and tell much about <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> today. <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON>'s expressed sympathy for Moslem fundamentalist women, barred by the <ORGANIZATION> Constitutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> from wearing Islamic headscarves on university campuses, apparently cost him the votes of millions of `` secular'' Turks. The fundamentalist vote, about 10 percent of the electorate, went to a religious party.

<HEAD>AIDS Reduces The Ranks Of Residents At NYC Hospitals</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Kings </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> is the <LOCATION> Parris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> of American medicine, a sometimes hellish boot camp that tuns out seasoned professionals. It has 140 internists in training, more than any other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> institution, and some of the city's poorest and sickest people. Recruiting a few good men and women, however, has been getting harder and harder. Five years ago, 90 percent of the hospital's medicine residents _ staff doctors in training _ were graduates of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> medical schools; today, less than half are. Even in the worst years, <LOCATION> Kings </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> could count on getting 20 to 25 graduates of the medical school of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, with which it is affiliated; last year not a single <ORGANIZATION> SUNY </ORGANIZATION> graduate applied, and only three of 60 first-year residents are from American schools. There are a many reasons why young doctors might shun a hospital like <LOCATION> Kings </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, but here's the most obvious: Half the patients in the internal medicine service have AIDS. `` That may have been the straw that broke the camel's back,'' says Dr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>, the medical school's provost. With more than 8,800 residents, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> hospitals train almost 10 percent of the nation's physicians _ three times more than any other city. But at a time when the hospitals need more residents than ever, the quality and quantity of applicants is declining. Leading teaching hospitals ca n't attract their top recruits, and others have scrambled to fill their residency slots with graduates of foreign medical schools. In recent years fewer <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> medical students have gone into less lucrative `` primary care'' specialities like internal medicine and pediatrics. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> seems to be having more trouble attracting such residents than other cities and one thing that sets it apart from them is AIDS. It has a fourth of the nation's cases, and in two years as many as 10,000 of its 25,000 general hospital beds could be filled by AIDS patients. Although the chances of doctors catching acquired immune deficiency syndrome from their patients are low, a survey at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> hospitals found that fear of AIDS preoccupied doctors and gave them nightmares. Medical students `` can be so overwhelmed with AIDS patients you do n't get the broad experience a resident wants,'' says <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON> <PERSON> Reich </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Emory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, chairman-elect of student representatives to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colleges </ORGANIZATION>. A residency is supposed to expose young physicians to a wide variety of illnesses and patients; doctors worry that if too many of their patients have AIDS, their exposure becomes too narrow and their diagnostic skills atrophy. A residency is also supposed to be educational but AIDS patients are so sick that their care leaves little time for study or consultation with senior doctors. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> is chief of medicine at <LOCATION> Kings </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. When he was making his hospital rounds as a resident 25 years ago, he usually had to spend only five to 10 minutes with each patient. `` A good proportion of them were n't particularly sick,'' he says. Now, though, `` one AIDS patient might require as much time and attention as six of the people I used to see,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> says. `` It takes an enormous toll, physicially and emotionally, on our staff.'' AIDS is the health care crisis of the decade, but in much of the nation it remains an exotic curiosity. `` Most people who are looking to go into private practice do n't think they'll be seeing many AIDS patients and do n't feel they need an intensive exposure to AIDS during their residency,'' says <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Osman </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Some doctors and students argue that caring for AIDS patients is good training. `` It does n't sound nice to say it, but AIDS patients have lots of medical problems, and the sickest patients are often the ones you learn the most from,'' says <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Samuels </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Syracuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, who plans to do his pediatric residency a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> hospital. The real problem may not be AIDS per se but the type of AIDS patients increasingly entering <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> hospitals: intravenous drug abusers. Nationally, AIDS is spreading fastest among drug users, their sex partners and children, and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> has about a third of all such cases. Drug abusers have surpassed gay men in newly reported cases in the city. The average drug-addicted AIDS patient is a physician's nightmare: he requires vast amounts of care, although very little can be done to help him He frequently fails to follow medical instructions, and often resents the doctor's inability to halt his decline. `` An important part of medicine is identifying with the patient, knowing how to talk to them,'' says <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON>, a student at <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sinai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` But that's so lacking with a lot of these AIDS patients. `` I have nothing in common with a male prostitute drug addict. I have sympathy for him, but I ca n't empathize.'' Homosexual men, on the other hand, are generally regarded as good patients. They tend to have supportive relatives and friends and a respect for medical authority. At <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, which has relatively few drug addicts, applications for internal medicine residencies has increased. The burden of caring for AIDS patients is accentuated by a shortage of nurses and support staff. That translates into the bane of every resident _ scut, hospital slang for necessary but non-medical tasks that can be performed by non-physicians, such as taking blood or delivering medical records. If students think <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is short of people to help with scut, they'll give its hospitals a wide berth, said <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> <PERSON> Balentine </PERSON>, chairman of student representatives to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colleges </ORGANIZATION>. `` The time you spend pushing a wheel chair is time you ca n't spend reading.'' At elite institutions like <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Presbyterian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> University-Bellevue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, AIDS and its related problems have merely made residency programs less selective. At others, it has meant an increase in the number of foreign medical school graduates hired as residents. Although everyone pays lip service to the notion that foreign medical school grads _ FMGs, as they're called _ are n't necessarily inferior to AMGs, the best teaching hospitals take virtually nothing but AMGs because they are a known commodity. This attitude, passed to students, guarantees segregation. `` If a program has a high percentage of foreign school grads, that program is that much less attractive to American school students,'' says <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Aklo </PERSON>, a fourth-year medical student at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> and a student representative to the medical colleges association. `` While most of us feel that the good students at foreign medical schools are as as good as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grads, the bad are really bad. They could n't get out of American schools. Doctors do n't want to work with other doctors who are weak.''

<HEAD>Spread Of Fire Ants Not Likely To Be Checked, Researcher Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELLIOTT MINOR</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 Farmers and homeowners should probably just learn to live with fire ants, says a researcher who has been unsuccessful at stopping the imported pests whose sting sends 21,000 Americans a year to doctors. `` With today's technology, there's nothing out there that'll eradicate them,'' said <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Diffie </PERSON>, a researcher at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION>'s Coastal Plain Experiment Station `` We can control them, but we ca n't eradicate them.'' <PERSON> Diffie </PERSON> and entomologist <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheppard </PERSON> are evaluating chemical and biological controls for the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> insect believed to have entered the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in Mobile, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, about 60 years ago. Since then, fire ants have spread to 270 million acres in the <LOCATION> Carolinas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>. Fire ants reproduce quickly and spread rapidly. In south <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, it's not uncommon to find 40 mounds per acre, which is n't a problem in pastures, but in fields where machinery is used `` you would have a problem,'' <PERSON> Diffie </PERSON> said `` They're a nuisance _ a people pest, whether it's unsightliness in your yards or stinging your kids,'' said <PERSON> Diffie </PERSON>. The ants' painful stings force at least 21,000 people to seek medical treatment each year, according to a survey of physicians in 13 states for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allergy </ORGANIZATION> and Immunology Nearly 40 percent of those treated were in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, according to the survey, and 20 percent were in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Thirty-two people died from stings last year, mostly people especially sensitive to the toxin and bitten more than once. `` People and physicians should take these stings seriously,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhoades </PERSON>, a pediatrician at the <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> who monitors medical problems caused by fire ants. People allergic to other kinds of insect stings should be especially cautious. The stings cause a burning sensation, usually followed by formation of pus around the site within 24 hours. But fire ants also help farmers by attacking pests such as ticks, worms and other insects that damage sugar cane, cotton and pecans. Up to 250,000 ants can live in each mound, which can extend up to six feet in the soil. `` They'll eat anything that's dead. You have to have something out there to clean up the carcasses,'' <PERSON> Diffie </PERSON> said. In the search for effective controls, <PERSON> Diffie </PERSON> has studied baits, pesticides and natural enemies such as nematodes and mites. He makes bait from corn grits soaked with soybean oil and poison. The bait, scattered on pastures and fields, is carried into fire ant mounds and kills ants that consume the mixture. Only a few ants in each colony are capable of reproduction. Fertile males and females have wings and mate in flight. Then the males die and the females establish new colonies. `` You have got to kill the queen,'' <PERSON> Diffie </PERSON> said. `` If you do n't, she'll just keep laying eggs.'' Common pesticides can kill fire ants, but do n't remain active long enough in the soil to be a long-term solution, he said. `` It would be nice if we could put them where we want them _ get them out of the yard and put them in the pecan orchards and sugar cane fields. But I'd rather see them gone altogether. If we did n't have them, we'd find ways to control the other pests.'' Concern about the environmental hazards has led researchers to look for biological controls, including microscopic worms known as nematodes, and straw-itch mites, which are a natural enemy of fire ants. `` Nematodes were mixed in water and poured over a fire ant mound. About 2 million nematodes could be mixed in two gallons of water,'' <PERSON> Diffie </PERSON> said. Those tests were n't considered very successful because only about 37 percent of the colonies treated with nematodes were destroyed. Mites were `` fairly successful,'' he said, `` But the cost is prohibitive as treatments are $ 5 per mound and two treatments are necessary.''

 <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> was a successful businessman who sought treatment for what his wife viewed as a gambling problem. He seemed bored until another patient told of the thrill of chasing women. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>, 35, sat forward, listened attentively, then astounded members of the therapy group with his own tales of womanizing. Twelve percent to 14 percent of patients who admit themselves for alcohol, drug and gambling addiction treatment also show patterns of sexual addiction, say <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Adkins </PERSON> and <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Taber </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. Multiple addictions are frequently found among patients being treated for one addiction, such as alcohol, drugs, gambling or kleptomania, agreed <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, a psychiatrist at University Hospitals of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. Two decades of bringing sex out of the closet have increased the number of patients who enter sex clinics, said <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>. `` We saw five or six patients in 1980, 20 in 1981, 125 in 1983. Every year the number goes up and up.'' Treatment includes group therapy, in which addicts hear others' rationalizations and `` see how they are kidding themselves, make them face what they are doing and understand the impact on the individual,'' he said That is followed by individual therapy, and if patients are married their wives get counseling. `` Then we bring the couples together and eventually we hope to start treating children, but not yet.'' Ninety percent of <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>'s patients are men. `` It may be that males have more of a tendency to act while women keep such problems private and quiet and it usually does n't lead to violence for them,'' he said. At the <LOCATION> VA </LOCATION> hospital in this <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> suburb, everyone seeking treatment for compulsive behavior must write and read their life story in the first two weeks of the four-week program, making them face their problems, Mrs. <PERSON> Adkins </PERSON> said. Addiction has several possible causes, including such external influences as alcohol, or changes in body chemistry, or there may be a genetic link because many addicts have addicted parents or grandparents, she said. `` There also is research on whether they become addicted to their own endorphins. When a risk taker begins -LRB- taking risks -RRB- his body shoots endorphins into his system. It's a type of morphine, it makes them feel good. `` They like the feeling so they continue the behavior to get the feeling.'' A number of self-help sex therapy groups have started nationwide in the past decade, operating much like Alcoholics Anonymous, she said. Sex Addicts Annonymous, started in <LOCATION> Minneapoils </LOCATION> in 1978, has 35 chapters in that area. Sex, Love Addicts Anonymous, a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> group, has about 400 chapters nationwide. Sexual compulsiveness covers a wide range of behavior, including perversion, obscene phone calls, exhibitionism, voyuerism, pedophilia, sadism, cruelty, rape and masochism, <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> said. He credits use in recent years of a progesterone known as Depo-Provera with helping many men regain control of their lives. But he also noted it produces such side effects as weight gain, high blood pressure, and hair loss. `` But for some, that's not as bad as the illness,'' he said. `` Perverse sexual behavior is a substitute for remembering trauma as children. They behave instead of feeling and remembering. We call it acting out. `` We try to help them remember and help them to feel.'' <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> said a typical sexual addict is a man who feels socially deficient, views himself as a loner who feels he was socially isolated as a child and teen and who has a history of being abused psychologically, physically and sexually. Mrs. <PERSON> Adkins </PERSON> said she found no typical profile. `` It cuts across so many personalities. It's an illness.''

<HEAD>AIDS Reduces The Ranks Of Residents At NYC Hospitals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Kings </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> is the <LOCATION> Parris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> of American medicine, a sometimes hellish boot camp that tuns out seasoned professionals. It has 140 internists in training, more than any other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> institution, and some of the city's poorest and sickest people. Recruiting a few good men and women, however, has been getting harder and harder. Five years ago, 90 percent of the hospital's medicine residents _ staff doctors in training _ were graduates of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> medical schools; today, less than half are. Even in the worst years, <LOCATION> Kings </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> could count on getting 20 to 25 graduates of the medical school of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, with which it is affiliated; last year not a single <ORGANIZATION> SUNY </ORGANIZATION> graduate applied, and only three of 60 first-year residents are from American schools. The most obvious reason why young doctors might shun a hospital like <LOCATION> Kings </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> is that half the patients in the internal medicine service have AIDS. With more than 8,800 residents, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> hospitals train 10 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> physicians _ three times more than any other city. At a time when hospitals need more residents, the quality and quantity of applicants is declining. Students `` can be so overwhelmed with AIDS patients you do n't get the broad experience a resident wants,'' says <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON> <PERSON> Reich </PERSON>, chairman-elect of student representatives to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colleges </ORGANIZATION> In addition, `` most people who are looking to go into private practice do n't think they'll be seeing many AIDS patients and do n't feel they need an intensive exposure to AIDS during their residency,'' says <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Osman </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> The real problem may not be AIDS per se but the type of AIDS patients: intravenous drug abusers. AIDS is spreading fastest among drug users, their sex partners and children, and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> has about a third of all such cases. At <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, which has relatively few addicts, applications for internal medicine residencies has increased.

<HEAD>Spread Of Fire Ants Not Likely To Be Checked, Researcher Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TIFTON, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Farmers and homeowners should probably just learn to live with fire ants, says a researcher who has been unsuccessful at stopping the imported pests whose sting sends 21,000 Americans a year to doctors. `` With today's technology, there's nothing out there that'll eradicate them,'' said <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Diffie </PERSON>, a researcher at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION>'s Coastal Plain Experiment Station `` We can control them, but we ca n't eradicate them.'' <PERSON> Diffie </PERSON> and entomologist <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheppard </PERSON> are evaluating chemical and biological controls for the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> insect believed to have entered the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in Mobile, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, about 60 years ago. Since then, fire ants have spread to 270 million acres in the <LOCATION> Carolinas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>. Their painful stings force at least 21,000 people to seek medical treatment a year, according to a survey of doctors in 13 states for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allergy </ORGANIZATION> and Immunology. Nearly 40 percent of those treated were in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; 20 percent were in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Thirty-two people died from stings last year, mostly people especially sensitive to the toxin and bitten more than once. `` People and physicians should take these stings seriously,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhoades </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION>, who monitors medical problems caused by fire ants. People allergic to other insect stings should be cautious. Fire ants also help farmers by attacking pests such as ticks, worms and other insects that damage sugar cane, cotton and pecans. Up to 250,000 ants can live in each mound, which can extend up to six feet in the soil.

<HEAD>Used in 4,000 B.C., Fig Chemical May Help Fight Viruses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A chemical ancient Babylonians extracted from figs to treat skin ailments is being used to develop animal vaccines and may prove to be important in detecting and fighting human viruses, a researcher says. The value of the chemicals, called psoralens, for virus detection and vaccine development lies in their ability to bind the twined double strands of the DNA molecule, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearst </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, chemistry professor who reported his work to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. Because psoralen molecules are flat, they can slip between the two strands of DNA without affecting the DNA itself. When psoralens are struck by light, they bind with the DNA, locking the two strands of the structure together. Vaccines are generally prepared by first killing a virus with formaldehyde and then placing the dead viral material into the body so the immune system can recognize proteins on the virus' outer coat and develop defenses. <PERSON> Formaldehye </PERSON> reacts with some viral proteins, so this is not always successful. By locking viral genetic material, psoralens rob a virus of its ability to replicate. Psoralens, used in <PERSON> Babylon </PERSON> as far back as 4,000 B.C. to treat skin pigmentation diseases, occur naturally in figs, some other plants and in some microorganisms. They sensitize the skin, promoting rapid tanning, and were used in tanning lotions until the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> labeled them as possible cancer causers a few years ago. <ORGANIZATION> Hearst </ORGANIZATION> said psoralens also can be used in DNA probes, segments of a DNA strand for a particular virus that is placed in a blood sample to bind to the particular virus or bacteria. By counting the free-floating DNA probes after the test, scientists can determine whether a particular virus is present. Because DNA probe bindings are generally weak, many are not maintained during the counting, he said, adding that if psoralens are attached to the DNA probes, the binding is much stronger.

<HEAD>Researchers Studying Question Of Growing Food In Space</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 One of the tough questions arising out of years-long space missions or life in a space station are what to do about sunlight, soil and gravity. Not for the astronauts _ for their food. `` On short missions it's a lot easier to resupply space stations with TV dinners than to have astronauts grow their own food. If you're going to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION> or beyond, it would become cheaper to grow it,'' said <PERSON> Gale </PERSON> <PERSON> Nevill </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> aerospace engineer working on space-based ways to grow crops. Plants can recycle nutrients and other valuable elements that otherwise would be discarded. Without recycling, astronauts would have to replace carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and others elements with costly, regular shipments from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. But growing wheat, rice, soybeans and other crops can be tricky. `` Right now, there are more problems than solutions,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Knott </PERSON>, chief scientist for <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s Controlled Ecological Life Support System project. `` There are some engineering problems in growing plants in microgravity. You ca n't go pouring water on a plant because it floats all over the place.'' Although models will be tested on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> in five to 10 years, it could be 20 to 50 years before automated planting and harvesting technology reaches space. Scientists are patterning the system after Earth: Plants take nutrition from manure and other waste products and produce food. Humans inhale oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide; plants use the carbon dioxide and produce oxygen. One problem associated with the lack of gravity is that nutrient-laden water tends to rise through roots and stems so fast that the plant does n't have time to extract nutrients. Researchers have designed a tiny collar to stop this flow, but the problem has yet to be solved completely, <PERSON> Nevill </PERSON> said. Scientists hope to reduce the time between harvests by about one-third, <PERSON> Knott </PERSON> said. Because of the limited area available for crops in a space station, the systems must yield three to 20 times more than an Earth farmer could grow.

<HEAD>Scientist Report Signs Of Acid-Snow Damage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thousands of fragile mountain lakes in the West could be endangered from acid snow, which already is causing environmental damage, says a researcher who has spent eight years studying the problem in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. One possible sign of the effects of acid precipitation is a drop in the number of neotene tiger salamanders in Mexican Cut, near Crested Butte, as acid levels rose, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Harte </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> professor. `` The decline of this salamander population may be the first indication of biological damage from acid precipitation in the western <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Harte </PERSON> said. He said he traced the acid pollution to coal-burning power plants, metal smelters and car emissions hundreds of miles away. He cautioned that his study, to be published in June, did not prove acid snow to be the undisputed cause, because the salamanders sometimes are subject to natural population fluctuations, and <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Svoboda </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said eight years of study may not be enough. The research is significant because <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has found that 6,500 high-elevation ponds and lakes in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> are highly vulnerable to acid precipitation. Such damage has been documented for years in the Northeast, but not in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. At issue is a symptom known as acid pulse, which happens each spring when the snow melts. The pollutants contained in the snow surge downstream into a string of 15 ponds in Mexican Cut, at 11,000 feet up in the <LOCATION> Rockies </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Harte </PERSON> found that without acid pulse, 80 percent of salamander eggs hatched, but with it, only about one third hatched. He said the salamander population dropped from 500 to 200 during the study.

<HEAD>Monitor Also Lets Doctors Treat Cardiac Care Patients By Phone</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A briefcase-sized monitor that plugs into a telephone outlet will let doctors for the first time not only monitor but also treat heart patients even before an ambulance can arrive. The first `` MDphone,'' developed by <ORGANIZATION> MEDphone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Paramus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, was installed recently in the home of a 72-year-old patient who had bypass surgery, said Dr. <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, director of cardiac care at <LOCATION> Sacred </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heart </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> here. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said his patient will have the MDphone for 90 days. `` This is the kind of thing you hope would not be used on the patient,'' he said. `` The first three months of a heart attack are critical because this is when a patient is at highest risk of having another cardiac episode.'' The MDphone is plugged into a wall jack. If a problem arises, the patient or family member just opens the case and attaches electrode pads. The machine automatically dials the hospital emergency room, setting off alarms. The base unit in the hospital retrieves the patient's records and displays them on one computer screen while another shows the electrocardiogram. If the patient develops a dangerously erratic heartbeat, known as cardiac arrhythmia, a doctor at Sacred Heart could immediately defibrillate the patient by signalling the device to deliver an electric shock. Telemetry systems that give data on patients at remote locations have been around for years, but the MDphone is the first that allows treatment in this way, said MEDphone President <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Wachtel </PERSON>. Sacred Heart and two other hospitals, the <ORGANIZATION> Wilmington-Christiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jewish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, cooperated in development of the MDphone, <PERSON> Wachtel </PERSON> said. The first installation in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> is expected in about two weeks. Each home unit costs $ 7,500 and base units installed in hospital emergency rooms are $ 30,000 each.

<HEAD>Detroit-Based Brewer Cracks Open A New Image</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Five years after what company officials admit was a false start in trying to break out of the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON>'s beer is taking a new look and message nationwide. <ORGANIZATION> Stroh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has sunk $ 50 million into the marketing campaign for its flagship brand that begins this week. Experts will be watching closely to see whether the effort founders amid flat beer sales in recent years and a market increasingly dominated by industry-leaders <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. `` Once you get beyond the No. 1 and No. 2 brewers, Nos. 3, 4 and 5 all face problems,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinman </PERSON>, editor of Beer Marketers Insights, an industry journal. `` They have to look to take sales from the big guys, but that's like taking it from gorillas.'' <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON>, privately held and based in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, is the nation's third-largest brewer But its entire lineup holds just an 11 percent share of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> beer market, compared with 41.9 percent for <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> and 21.6 percent for <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, according to <ORGANIZATION> Beverage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION>. Company sources told The <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON> annual revenues have stagnated at $ 1.5 billion annually since 1985. And the <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON>'s brand itself holds only 2 percent of the national market, Beverage Industry said The new campaign includes revamped advertising, redesigned containers and even new posters and mirrors to be distributed to bars and party stores. `` We consider this a continuation of our -LRB- national -RRB- introduction of the brand,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON> vice president of marketing. `` Our opportunity with <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON>'s is to appeal to a lot of people in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> who have never even had a <ORGANIZATION> Stroh </ORGANIZATION>'s,'' said <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Riney </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> advertising executive who created the new campaign. `` And there are millions of those.'' <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON> will spend $ 20 million on <PERSON> Riney </PERSON>'s new ads, which will stress both the new packaging and the company's 200-year heritage as a family enterprise. <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION>, by comparison, spent an estimated $ 130 million in 1988 just to advertise Budweiser. Another industry expert questioned whether <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON> could overcome the growing piles of money that <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> are throwing into a market diluted in recent years by beverages other than beer. `` I know of no brewers in the history of the brewing industry who have ever turned around a brand after a serious slide,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON>, head of R.S. <ORGANIZATION> Weinberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's a very unforgiving industry.'' <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON> still has other brands on which to fall back, including <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Schlitz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON>, all of which it acquired earlier this decade. But officials are hopeful of reviving the company's namesake brand. `` In my 11 years here, this is the most striking set of changes I've seen,'' <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON> president <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Fridholm </PERSON> said. `` I think we have a chance of getting some very positive consumer reaction.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> suitor <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> is determined to continue with his bid to buy the airline, Gov. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> said today after meeting secretly in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> with the billionaire oilman. `` He's serious,'' <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> said early today in a telephone interview from his hotel room in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` He said he's going to the mat, and I believe him.'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' $ 2.62 billion offer for <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s parent, has been rejected by the company's board, but <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> still plans to outline today how he would pay for the buyout of the nation's fourth-largest carrier. Neither <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> nor a spokesman could be reached immediately for comment. <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON>, who has led efforts to stop <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' attempted takeover, met Sunday morning with <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who flew into <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> on his private jet. <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on other state business. KSTP-TV taped the two shaking hands on the tarmac before the 90-minute meeting. <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> said he had heard talk that <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> has been unable to put together financing to buy <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, and `` I was hoping to hear that -LRB- <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> was -RRB- going to back off.'' But the governor said he found a determined <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. `` He knows what he wants,'' <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> said. `` This -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- is what he wants. He's not going away. I think it's -LRB- the takeover battle -RRB- going to be a long one.'' <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> said he left the meeting with a favorable impression of <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, but he added that he will continue his effort to stop the takeover. `` Some people were saying he's in it just to make a quick buck,'' the governor said. `` That's not his intent. He's put a lot of money into this effort.'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> told <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> he also considered making offers for <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. `` He's interested in <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> because it goes to the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, and that's the future,'' the governor said. `` I think this is going to be the Super Bowl of takeovers.'' <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> said the meeting gave him a chance to tell <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> the importance of keeping intact the airline, which employees more than 15,000 people in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> assured him that jobs and the airline hub would stay in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, and that <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> planned further expansion in the state.

 Share prices were moderately firmer in dull trading early Monday afternoon as traders said the market lacked a unifying theme to push it in either direction. `` There's not a lot of action,'' said one British dealer. `` We always find Mondays are a bit hesitant and it takes some time for the market to get rekindled from the weekend.'' British economic indicators released late in the morning did little to inspire more activity in the market, dealers said. Some market watchers said most eyes were on the futures market, where stock-index futures traded up to a 60-point premium over the cash market. Others said the onset of a three-week trading account tended to put off investment decisions until a clear short-term direction for the market could be discerned. At noontime in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> 100-share index was hovering just above 2,058.0, a gain of 4 points, or .19 percent. The market made its way toward the 2,065.3 intraday high in early trading, while its late morning low point was 2,056.8. At 11 a.m. GMT, the narrower <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> 30-share index was off 2.3 points at 1,688.7. Turnover amounted to 218.3 million shares by midday.

 Stock prices were recovering in early trading today, after a sluggish start as the market took a breather from Friday's strong advances. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 4.03 points to 2,341.09 at 11 a.m. EDT. The blue-chip indicator had lost 4.22 points an hour earlier.

Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 42.58 million shares. Analysts said that despite today's weak start and a new consumer price report on Tuesday, stock prices could continue Friday's gains. New producer price data, which showed a 0.4 percent increase for March, triggered a sharp rally on Friday after the market languished in the week leading up to the report. The producer price number was interpreted as good news for the market and an indication that inflationary pressures were subsiding after rises of 1 percent in each of the previous two months.

 Money-losing <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> today said it will eliminate its supercomputer business and make other cuts that will cost 3,100 jobs. The computer maker decided it `` ca n't afford to continue product development across such a wide section of products,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>. The move will result in restructuring charges of $ 490 million, including $ 350 million from liquidation of <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION>, the subsidiary started in 1983 to compete with Twin Cities rival <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and other supercomputer makers. Asked if <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> attempted to sell <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said, `` We looked at all options. The shutdown was the most practical.'' <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> has never made money for <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION>. In 1988 it had operating losses of about $ 100 million. It has sold 34 machines ranging in price from $ 1 million to $ 20 million. <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> will account for 800 of the 3,100 layoffs, with the rest made in corporate ranks and other sectors, <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said the company will continue to service its supercomputer customers. Besides focusing on its Cyber mainframe computers, <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> will also build its data storage business and businesses such as lottery equipment for states. <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> stock dropped 62 -LCB- cents to $ 21.75 in early morning trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON> said the company, which has had five consecutive years of financial difficulty, said the restructuring should result in a profitable second half of 1989 and set the stage for sustained growth. <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> has had two consecutive quarterly losses, including a $ 12.8 million loss in the fourth quarter of 1988. For the year, the company had a profit of $ 1.7 million after earning $ 19.3 million in 1987 and losing a total of $ 832 million in 1986 and 1985. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said most of the restructuring costs will be charged against the second quarter of this year.

 <ORGANIZATION> PPG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said today that higher sales and operating earnings in its coatings and chemicals businesses helped produce the company's best first quarter ever, with a 9 percent profit increase. The company said after-tax earnings rose to $ 129.8 million, or $ 1.15 per share, in the first 1989 quarter from $ 118.6 million, or $ 1.07 per share, in 1988's first quarter. Sales increased 6 percent to $ 1.459 billion from $ 1.373 billion. Lower sales of flatglass and unfavorable currency transactions washed out sales gains for original and replacement auto glass, the Pittsburgh-based company said. Sales of glass, <ORGANIZATION> PPG </ORGANIZATION>'s leading product, slid 1.7 percent to $ 588 million from $ 598 million. Operating earnings for the unit dropped 18.3 percent to $ 94 million from $ 115 million. Increased sales of automotive paint and industrial coatings and progress in controlling costs overcame the less favorable currency exchange rates in <ORGANIZATION> PPG </ORGANIZATION>'s second-largest line. Unit sales rose 10 percent to $ 512 million from $ 465 million, and operating earnings rose 17.6 percent to $ 80 million from $ 68 million. Improved prices and sales volume for most basic and specialty chemicals, including a new chemical plant in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, helped lift the unit's revenue 40.7 percent to $ 315 million from $ 261 million and boost operating earnings 20.6 percent to $ 76 million from $ 63 million.

 <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> today delivered the last of 50 C-5B jumbo cargo planes to the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, completing a seven-year, $ 6.9 billion contract that drew accusations of greed from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The final C-5B, the biggest air cargo carrier in the free world, took off after a ceremony, made a salute lap around <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in suburban <LOCATION> Marietta </LOCATION> and then headed for the air base at <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del </LOCATION>. The company has no plans for further production of the C-5B, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Z. </PERSON> <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON>, director of the C-5 program. <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautical </ORGANIZATION> is a division of <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Calabasas </LOCATION>, Calif.-based aeronautics giant. The C-5B is 248 feet long, has a wing span of 223 feet and a 65-foot, T-shaped tail, high as a six-story building. The jet, an updated version of the C-5A, can carry almost any piece of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s hardware _ two 50-ton M-1 tanks, for example. It has been used recently for such non-military missions as carrying equipment and supplies to the site of the Exxon Valdez oil spill in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and aid to the victims of the earthquake in the Soviet republic of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Capt. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolney </PERSON>. The huge contract has been a boon to the Atlanta-area, providing thousands of jobs and pumping millions of subcontracting dollars into 40 states. Today's ceremony marked a happy landing in the flight of the C-5B project. But it was a bumpy ride. <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> won the contract in 1982, beating out <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION>. The original pact was for $ 7.8 billion. Production of the plane's predecessor, the C-5A, was marred by revelations that the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> had purchased ineffective repair kits from <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> that included $ 229.94 nickel-sized washers. Shortly before the first C-5B was to be delivered in late 1985, it was discovered that tens of thousands of nuts on the planes had to be replaced because the ones installed were the wrong kind. The Pentagon accused the company of inflating the C-5B contract by as much as $ 500 million by withholding details of a proposed two-tier wage system for its new employees; by 1987 the price tag had been whittled down to $ 6.9 billion. A review by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' investigative arm, found that in late 1986 <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> proposed to charge the government $ 211.13 for an inch-long shim, a metal wedge that was an excess part from C-5B production and originally valued at $ 22.09 Last month, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said it had imposed flight restrictions on 20 C-5B's because of a problem with the pylon, the assembly that holds the jet engine to the wing. <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> has proposed to the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> that the plant maintain its C-5B tooling, company spokesman <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> said. `` Their decision will pretty much tell us what the future of the C-5B is,'' he said.

<HEAD>Idaho Wood Products Company Reports Record Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOISE, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Boise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cascade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Monday reported all-time quarterly records for profits, sales and earnings per share During the first three months of 1989, the Boise-based wood products company said after-tax income rose to $ 78.2 million, up 14 percent from $ 68.5 million in the same quarter a year earlier. Sales came to $ 1.1 billion in the latest quarter, up from $ 1 billion a year before. Earnings per share were $ 1.68 in this year's first quarter compared to $ 1.44 in the corresponding 1988 quarter. It was the second straight quarter and the sixth in the last seven in which new highs were posted in net income. `` We expect the company to have another excellent year in 1989 if the economy continues to grow at a modest rate,'' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Fery </PERSON> said. `` Relatively strong markets for most paper grades and for office products should largely offset a soft market for newsprint.'' All three of the corporation's major segments _ paper and paper products, building products and office products _ posted increased sales and operating income over the first quarter of 1988. In the paper segment, which produces over half the company's sales, price increases for uncoated papers offset softness in the newsprint sector and continued tight margins in the corrugated container business as well as disruption of pulp and paper mill operations due to severe weather in February Office products posted record sales and operating income as volume increased 17 percent over a year earlier and the corporation maintained and increased its market share in almost every major urban area it serves, <PERSON> Fery </PERSON> said. The building products segment showed only modest improvement over a year ago, but the gain came despite the sale of three wood-products plants that were contributing to the corporate balance sheet during the first quarter of 1988. With prices for western lumber and plywood up from year-earlier levels, <PERSON> Fery </PERSON> said, `` We expect our building products segment to do as well as it did last year.''

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar fell sharply Monday against major currencies in European trading after signs of a slowdown in the American economy. Gold prices also dropped. Foreign exchange dealers said recent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic statistics had confused their market about whether the dollar was headed higher or lower and the uncertainty caused a drop. They said the main factors had been the 20.9 percent swelling in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit to $ 10.5 billion in February and the slowing of the growth rate in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> producer prices. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consumer price index due on Tuesday could set the dollar's tone for the rest of the week, dealers said. One dealer said if the rise in the index is small, the dollar could drop from 1.85 German marks to 1.83. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, one British pound cost $ 1.7095 late Monday, more expensive for buyers than Friday's $ 1.7000. Other late rates for the dollar in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> compared with Friday's late rates: 1.8565 West German marks, down from 1.8725; 1.6385 Swiss francs, down from 1.6510; 6.2825 French francs, down from 6.3350; 2.0953 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1145; 1,364.00 Italian lire, down from 1,374.25; 1.1855 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1875 Earlier in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> the dollar closed at 131.83 Japanese yen, down from 132.55 at Friday's close.

<HEAD>Insurers, Businesses Fight Over Who Pays For Multibillion-dollar
Cleanups</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL J. WAKIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The start of multibillion-dollar industrial waste cleanups around the nation has triggered a legal war between insurance companies and corporate polluters over who should foot the bill. Insurers last week won their second battle in recent months, when a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> judge ruled that 126 insurers for former <ORGANIZATION> Diamond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shamrock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> bore no liability for injuries caused by the production of a toxic byproduct of the defoliant Agent Orange. Lawyers said the decision by <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Reginald </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanton </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Morristown </LOCATION> will have bearing on more than 50 similar lawsuits involving billions of dollars around the country. Potentially, the problem could involve thousands of cleanup sites. The Diamond Shamrock case is `` part of a larger struggle that's going on between the insurance industry and companies'' facing cleanup costs, said <PERSON> Jacquie </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, a lawyer with the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> In December, a jury found <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> liable for cleaning up the <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arsenal </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, where the company leased land from the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> from 1952 to 1982 for a pesticide production plant. The jury ruled that <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> could not collect from its more than 250 insurers for cleanup and injury costs at the site estimated by the federal government in 1983 at $ 1.8 billion. `` I think that the insurance companies are now engaged in a massive nationwide effort in courts and the media to try to renege on their obligations to their policy-holder,'' said <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> lawyer whose firm represents more than 40 policy-holders fighting for insurance coverage. Judge <PERSON> Stanton </PERSON> ruled that <PERSON> Diamond </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>'s insurance policies do not cover an industrial cleanup of more than $ 25 million because the company knowingly bypassed environmental controls, polluting the <LOCATION> Passaic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and land around a <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> plant with dioxin. The company, then known as <ORGANIZATION> Diamond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alkali </ORGANIZATION>, made Agent Orange and other herbicides at the <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> plant from 1951 to 1969. A byproduct was dioxin, which has been linked to various cancers, liver disease, birth defects and a severe skin rash. `` Diamond's conduct in operating the <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> plant was unacceptably wrong and irresponsible,'' <PERSON> Stanton </PERSON> wrote in a 50-page opinion. `` Diamond always put its narrowly perceived economic interest first. It deliberately and persistently cheated on the limited environmental regulations which were in place.'' But <PERSON> Stanton </PERSON> did order the insurers to pay the company's $ 23 million share of a $ 180 million settlement with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> War victims of Agent Orange, which was used to strip natural cover from guerillas. For <ORGANIZATION> Maxus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Diamond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shamrock </ORGANIZATION>'s parent, the cleanup cost in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> will exceed $ 25 million. <ORGANIZATION> Maxus </ORGANIZATION> said it intervened as soon as dioxin was found at the site in 1983 and cooperated with environmental officials in its removal. Diamond Alkali was a predecessor of <ORGANIZATION> Diamond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shamrock </ORGANIZATION>, which was sold to <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in 1986. <ORGANIZATION> Maxus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> assumed liability for cleanups of certain sites, including the <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> plant. After the 1986 sale, <ORGANIZATION> Maxus </ORGANIZATION> set aside a $ 75 million reserve for cleanup costs, spokeswoman <PERSON> Ginger </PERSON> <PERSON> Shearburn </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Maxus </ORGANIZATION> called <PERSON> Stanton </PERSON>'s ruling on the dioxin `` incorrect'' and is considering an appeal. Its stock dropped 12 -LCB- cents to $ 7.62 -LCB- Wednesday, a day after the decision was released to lawyers, and was trading in the $ 7 range Monday. <PERSON> Stanton </PERSON>'s ruling goes against much of the state's case law on the subject, which is generally favorable to policy-holders, lawyers said. More than a dozen such lawsuits have been filed in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, the most in the nation. Diamond Shamrock sued its insurers over the <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> plant in 1984. Two years later it again sued its insurers, seeking coverage for about 20 non-dioxin sites nationwide. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON>, attorney for <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Re-Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION>, a defendant in the <LOCATION> Morristown </LOCATION> lawsuits, said <PERSON> Stanton </PERSON>'s decision could have a major impact on the second case, in which cleanup costs were not available Ms. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, an environmental activist group, said insurance policies should be expensive enough and companies should assume enough risk to guarantee they handle and dispose of dangerous materials properly. But she added that society needs an `` insurance cushion'' to protect an innocent third party if a company can not pay for a cleanup. `` It's a fine line to draw,'' she said.

 Stock prices on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> closed mixed Monday in lackluster trading. At the close the <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> 100-share index was up 1.1 points, or .05 percent, at 2054.7. The narrower <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> 30-share index was down 4.9 points at 1686.1, reflecting losses by several major capitalized stocks. Volume was thin, as 468.1 million shares changed hands, compared with Friday's 648.1 million shares. Shares got off to a buoyant start on the back of continued enthusiasm following Friday's rally in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and on Wall Street. But the positive tone wore thin as participants steered clear of the market and as doubts about the underlying health of the British economy returned. `` There's a general degree of uncertainty'' about the British economic picture, said one trader. A major worry at the moment is whether higher wage settlements will add to inflationary pressures, he added. There was little reaction to news that British retail sales in March were unchanged in volume terms from the previous month, while rising 4.7 percent from a year earlier. While perhaps signaling a slowing of consumer demand, the provisional figures could be revised significantly in coming weeks, dealers said.

 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, saying its <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> unit has `` turned the corner,'' reported Monday that companywide earnings more than doubled in the first quarter. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION> said it earned $ 76.4 million, or 73 cents a share, during the quarter ended March 31, up from $ 34.4 million, or 33 cents a share, in the first quarter of 1988. The earnings came on an 18 percent increase in consolidated revenue, to $ 1.77 billion from $ 1.5 billion. <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the long-distance telephone operation which lost $ 124 million in the first quarter of 1988, had operating income of $ 27.5 million this time. Its operating revenue increase 30 percent to $ 984 million from about $ 757 million a year earlier. A 9 percent gain in traffic volume offset the effects of a first-quarter price decrease, producing revenue gains of 6 percent over the fourth quarter of 1988. `` Clearly, <LOCATION> US </LOCATION> Sprint has turned the corner,'' said <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Esrey </PERSON>. <LOCATION> US </LOCATION> Sprint was formed in July 1986 as a joint venture in which <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> combined their long-distance and data communications subsidiaries. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION>, which also provides local phone service in several states, purchased controlling interest last year. <PERSON> Esrey </PERSON> cited significant new revenue growth opportunities in the international market, the public pay phone market and a contract with the federal government.

<HEAD>Judge Refuses To Dismiss Lawsuit By Ethanol Producers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A federal judge has refused to dismiss a $ 2.1 billion antitrust lawsuit filed by fuel alcohol producers against four major oil companies. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> on Friday rejected the oil companies' argument that the ethanol producers were not in competition with them and therefore had no financial interest that would lead them to sue. Seven ethanol producers allege that the oil companies _ <ORGANIZATION> Marathon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> AMOCO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION> _ conspired to ruin the market for gasohol, a blend of 90 percent gasoline and 10 percent ethanol. Attorney <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, representing the plaintiffs, has argued that the oil companies tried to `` retard'' the growth of the ethanol industry. The judge ruled the oil companies and the ethanol producers were in competition for the non-diesel automobile fuel market. The ethanol makers contend the oil companies used signs on their gasoline pumps saying such things as `` our gasoline contains no alcohol or ethanol'' to discourage motorists from using gasohol. Ethanol, which can be made from corn, increases the octane of gasoline and reduces pollution in automobile emissions, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Growers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The plaintiffs are <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rockford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Rockford </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Shepherd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>.; <ORGANIZATION> Vidalia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethanol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, of Vidalia, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>.; <ORGANIZATION> Lakefield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethanol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Lakefield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>; A.E. <ORGANIZATION> Montana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont </LOCATION>.; <ORGANIZATION> Shreveport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethanol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Shreveport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>.; and <ORGANIZATION> Alpebo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>.

 A federal bankruptcy judge granted a one-week extention today to <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and its creditors to devise plans for a sale or restructuring, but he warned delays were devouring the strike-crippled carrier. The order by Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> came as lawyers for pilots and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> confirmed the existence of another possible bidder besides the three previously known: ex-baseball boss <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>, hotelier <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON> and takeover investor <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>. But the lawyers would n't identify the fourth bidder. Directors of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> meanwhile, said they have decided it should no longer pursue the sale of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> but will consider selling `` a substantial part of the company's assets'' to pay its debts The <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> board's statement essentially approved <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> management's decision last Wednesday, after a deal with <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> fell through, to reduce <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> to about 60 percent of its pre-strike size. `` As time goes by there are fewer alternatives to explore,'' <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> told a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> courtroom crammed with about 50 uniformed pilots and lawyers for <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, creditors and the striking unions. `` This airline is hemorrhaging,'' he said. `` It is not tolerable that this process be so lengthy that the parties have nothing left to consider.'' <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> had called a hearing today requesting that management, creditors and the unions show cause why he should n't put the entire airline up for auction, including assets owned by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> before <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> bought it three years ago. `` We are not here selling a used car at a foreclosure sale,'' creditors committee attorney <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Zweibel </PERSON> told the judge. `` We are selling a complicated business.'' At the urging of <PERSON> Zweibel </PERSON> and lawyers for Eastern management, <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> gave them one more week to negotiate and review possible options for the Miami-based airline, one of the nation's largest and most unprofitable. He set a new hearing for 11 a.m. next Monday. <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> granted the delay over the objection of attorneys for the unions and a dissident creditor who sought the hearing. They have been pushing for more aggressive court action to get Eastern flying again, either through a sale or the appointment of an outsider to run the airline. Eastern management has said it wants to restructure into a much smaller operation. Eastern workers have been on strike since March 4, charging <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> boss <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> has butchered it and plotted to destroy their unions by transferring valuable assets to sister carrier <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> put Eastern into bankruptcy court refuge March 9 and sought a buyer. <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>, the former baseball commissioner and Olympics organizer, nearly completed a $ 464 million deal to buy <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> but the sale collapsed. However, sources familiar with the Eastern situation have said <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> remains interested in making a new offer. <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON>, owner of the Hyatt hotel chain, and <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, also have been lurking in the background as possible buyers. After the <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> hearing today, pilots union attorney <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> told reporters there was a fourth bidder. In a statement issued today, <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> was quoted as saying the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> board believes a sale of Eastern `` is not in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Air or <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s best interests or in the best interests of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s creditors. The board made the decision at a meeting this morning and its vote was unrelated to <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON>'s action today, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> said from the company's headquarters in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. The statement said: `` In order to resolve promptly the Eastern situation, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> had been willing to agree to a quick sale -LRB- even at a price which did not nearly reflect <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s net asset value -RRB- and had selected the prospective buyer _ the group led by <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> _ who it believed was most likely to be able to consummate a transaction promptly. `` With the collapse of those efforts, because of totally unreasonable and unworkable union demands, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> has determined that further sale efforts are unlikely to be successful, and in fact, would be counterproductive.'' <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON> resurfaced Friday with a $ 500 million proposal to buy <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, which his representatives presented to the 15-member committee of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s major creditors, sources close to the situation said. <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> remained interested in reviving his bid, and <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, the owner and chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, talked to union officials this weekend about a possible deal, said the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity. Lawyers representing <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and its unions also met during the weekend, but little of significance was said to have emerged from the talks. `` Parameters were being drawn,'' said one participant who insisted on anonymity.

 It's a long way from Wall Street to the 6th floor of <ORGANIZATION> Bridgeport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, but a lawsuit being heard here is being closely watched by stockbrokers. Closing arguments are to begin Tuesday in a legal dispute that pits <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> against one of the so-called `` superbrokers'' it hired away from competitors in the early 1980s, most from <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kuhn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loeb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Five of the brokers were fired in 1984 They filed suit against <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> and its parent, <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, claiming the investment firm lured them away just to capture their multimillion dollar client base. Four of the brokers agreed to arbitration before the case could go to trial in federal court in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Winters </PERSON> pursued the case and is asking for at least $ 16 million in damages. He claims he was fired unjustly. The case ended up in the <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> courts after <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> obtained a lien against <ORGANIZATION> Winters </ORGANIZATION>' <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> home to recover a $ 300,000 signing bonus he was to repay if he was fired within four years because of poor performance. <PERSON> Perrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Lipper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Analytical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> is watching the case with interest largely because it is highly unsual for brokers to sue their former employers. `` If there is any disagreement, they try to settle it ... in-house,'' he said Monday. `` They are watching this very closely ... to see whether the suit sets a precedent for future suits.'' <PERSON> Winters </PERSON>, 46, calls <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION>'s actions outrageous. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spirer </PERSON>, an attorney representing <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION>, says <PERSON> Winters </PERSON> has failed to prove the brokerage house did anything malicious or false. The case had its origins in October 1982, when <PERSON> Winters </PERSON> left <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kuhn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loeb </ORGANIZATION>, now <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, to join <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION>. He and other new employees were touted as `` superbrokers'' in brochures <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> sent out to potential customers. The brokers earned the nickname because each had produced more than $ 1 million in annual commissions. When he joined <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Winters </PERSON> was given two promissary notes, one for $ 240,000 and another for $ 60,000, that were secured by an advance compensation agreement. The principal amounts for both were due in five years without interest. But on March 23, 1984, <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> fired Winters for alleged willful misconduct. After <PERSON> Winters </PERSON> filed his original lawsuit in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> went to court in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> seeking to collect on its promissary notes. Winters denied that he owed <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> any money and filed seven counterclaims, seeking damages for breach of employment contract, false and fraudulent promises and defamatory statements. <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> won a judgment against Winters who appealed to the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The court granted him a new trial in March 1988. Winter's attorney, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaman </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Spirer </PERSON> told the judge they had agreed on most points to be covered in the final arguments and would be ready for the arguments Tuesday. <PERSON> Spirer </PERSON> also has asked the court to dimiss <PERSON> Winters </PERSON>' counterclaims before the case gets to the jury. Judge <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrigan </PERSON> reserved a decision on the request. He indicated he would rule after hearing the closing arguments.

 In a growing movement to force corporations to disclose more information about animal experimentation, animal-rights activists are taking their fight directly to shareholders. This year, shareholders at 10 companies will vote on resolutions proposed by animal-rights activists, an increase of two over 1988, according to the Washington-based Investor Responsibility Research Center. `` It's a thoughtful and sophisticated way to encourage companies to seriously consider questions of humane treatment of animals in connection with their business,'' said attorney <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lovenheim </PERSON>, who has represented about a dozen groups seeking animal-rights resolutions. Corporations generally have opposed the proxy resolutions. After years of fruitless picketing against <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Surgical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s use of dogs in product tests, activists secured a resolution on the company's proxy ballot for its May 2 annual meeting demanding a halt to the tests People for the <ORGANIZATION> Ethical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treatment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Animals </ORGANIZATION> has proxy resolutions asking eight corporations _ <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Avon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Bristol-Meyer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Colgate-Palmolive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Greyhound </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Schering-Plough </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> _ to cite progress in developing alternatives to animal testing. For the third year, <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has included an animal-rights resolution on its ballot. The proposal, filed by an individual shareholder, simply asks the company to disclose information on animal experiments that it may conduct. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> has opposed the resolution. On all issues, 170 proxy resolutions have been proposed this year, about half dealing with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Investor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Responsibility </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, which monitors shareholders' resolutions. In 1985, <PERSON> Lovenheim </PERSON> successfully sued Greenwich-based <ORGANIZATION> Iroquois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, in which he held stock, to get his animal-rights resolution included for vote in the company's proxy ballot. <PERSON> Lovenheim </PERSON> wanted to know whether the French farmers who supplied the company with goose liver were treating the fowl humanely. The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals drafted a resolution for the <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> proxy ballot this year, but withdrew it after <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> agreed to assess farming practices used to produce its meat and eggs. `` It was gratifying this year to find McDonald's was willing to sit down and discuss the proposal,'' said <PERSON> Lovenheim </PERSON>, who represented the <ORGANIZATION> ASPCA </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lovenheim </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has supported every resolution he has proposed or defended, despite corporate objections. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anti-Vivisection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> last week filed suit in federal court in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> against Norwalk-based <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Surgical </ORGANIZATION>, charging the company used false information in recommending that a resolution calling for suspension of animal testing be rejected. The society has owned 66 shares of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Surgical </ORGANIZATION>, which manufactures surgical products, since 1983. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Surgical has been a target of protests by animal-rights groups for years, but the dispute drew national attention in November, when an animal activist allegedly planted a remote-controlled bomb outside the company's headquarters. Authorities said animal activist <PERSON> Fran </PERSON> <PERSON> Trutt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> intended to detonate the bomb and kill <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Surgical Chairman <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON>. No one was injured in the incident. Trutt is awaiting trial on a charge of attempted murder.

<HEAD>1st-Qtr Profit Rises at Tribune, McGraw-Hill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday its first-quarter earnings rose 14 percent from a year ago, while another media concern, <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said an accounting change turned what would have been an earnings decline into a 15.6 percent increase. The Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said it earned $ 36.8 million, or 49 cents a share, in the three months ended March 26 compared with $ 32.2 million, or 42 cents a share, in the same 1988 period. First-quarter revenue rose 6 percent to $ 553 million from $ 522 million in 1988. <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> said its operating profit from newspapers including the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> rose 19 percent to $ 61.6 million as revenue rose 5 percent to $ 394 million. Its broadcasting and entertainment group had an operating loss of $ 1.4 million in contrast with a loss of $ 3.5 million in the same quarter in 1988 despite a 15 percent rise in revenue to $ 105 million. The division includes six TV stations, five radio stations, a syndicated TV news program and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cubs </ORGANIZATION> baseball team. Operating profit from its newsprint operations fell 27 percent to $ 16.7 million on steady revenue of $ 109 million. <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said its profit rose to $ 31.2 million, or 64 cents a share, in the three months ended March 31 compared $ 27 million, or 56 cents a share, a year earlier. First-quarter revenue rose 5.2 percent to $ 416 million from $ 396 million a year earlier. The publishing and information services concern said an accounting change involving income taxes boosted its first-quarter profit by $ 8 million, the cumulative effect of the accounting change in previous years. It said without the change, made in accordance with <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> standards, the company's profit would have fallen 14 percent. <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> said its pre-tax income tumbled 27.8 percent, reflecting sale of assets including a professional training system, healthcare publications and an accounting software business. That was partially offset by tax benefits from those sales, the company said. Its publishing division which includes Business Week magazine, four television stations and its educational publishing business had an operating loss of $ 8.1 million in contrast with a loss of $ 3.3 million a year earlier. The wider operating loss reflected costs of starting a new reading series and the acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Random </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s college and school divisions for $ 200 million last December. The operating profit at its information services division fell 13.2 percent to $ 28.8 million. That division provides data in a variety of forms to the construction, legal, aerospace and energy markets among others. <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION>'s financial services unit had an operating profit of $ 28.2 million, up 34.3 percent from a year earlier. That division includes the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's debt ratings as well as equity and commodity information.

 <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday that their first-quarter profit fell sharply over a year ago, while another large banking concern, <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> posted a healthy gain in earnings. <PERSON> Chase </PERSON>, the nation's second largest bank holding company, based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said it netted $ 132 million, or $ 1.27 a share, for the three months ended March 31, a 52 percent drop from earnings of $ 277 million, or $ 3.09 a share, in 1988. The company said last year's income included $ 161 million from asset sales and income tax benefits. No. 5 <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said it earned $ 179.3 million, or $ 1.54 a share, in the quarter, up 22 percent from $ 147.2 million, or $ 1.30 a share, in the first quarter of 1988. Manufacturers Hanover, ranked seventh and based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, posted a 27 percent decline in its quarterly profit, to $ 103 million, or $ 1.84 a share, from $ 141 million, or $ 2.56 a share. The 1988 quarter included $ 40 million from tax benefits and the sale of one of its subsidaries. <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> said it had higher net interest income and an increase in fees but they were partly offset by lower income from foreign exchange and other trading activities. The company's provision for credit losses stood at $ 150 million in the quarter, the same as a year ago. First-quarter net interest income totaled $ 797.04 million, up 9 percent from $ 732.34 million last year. Non-interest income fell 34 percent to $ 420.24 million from $ 633.42 million, while non-interest expenses rose 2 percent to $ 876.01 million from $ $ 855.74 million. <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> said its net interest income totaled $ 733.8 million, up from $ 631.4 million a year earlier. Non-interest income was $ 431.6 million, up from $ 421 million in the first quarter of last year. Non-interest expense totaled $ 755.4 million, vs. $ 730.0 million last year. Manufacturers Hanover said its net interest income totaled $ 466 million, compared with $ 495 million a year ago. Non-interest income fell to $ 317 million from $ 375 million, while non-interest expenses fell 4 percent to $ 509 million from $ 528 million.

 The stock market closed narrowly mixed in light, featureless trading today, as investors turned cautious ahead of Tuesday's consumer price report. The market opened lower, rebounded briefly then edged downward through the remainder of the session as many participants retreated to await the latest economic data. Analysts said the market is expecing a rise of between 0.4 percent and 0.6 percent in the consumer price index, which is a gauge of the cost of living. In February, consumer prices rose 0.4 percent. `` The whole world revolved around that number today,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` People were reluctant to take positions pending the outcome.'' On Friday, the market had rallied sharply after the government reported that the producer price index rose 0.4 percent in March. The market interpreted the data as good news after rises of 1 percent in each of the previous two months. Economists said the <ORGANIZATION> PPI </ORGANIZATION>, a measure of inflation at the wholesale level, was in line with other data that suggested the economy is slowing and that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> probably would not be pushing interest rates up in the immediate future. `` People realized that Friday might have been too much too soon,'' said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Puccio </PERSON>, senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Dillon </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Read </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. Even before trading activity slowed, analysts said volume was fairly light with many players taking the week off in preparation for the Jewish holiday of Passover on Wednesday.

 Gasoline prices soared to three-year highs Monday amid continued worries about supplies following the Alaskan oil spill. The gasoline rally, which included a 2-cent-a-gallon increase, helped push up prices of crude oil and other refined petroleum products traded on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Lebow </PERSON>, a senior energy analyst with <ORGANIZATION> E.D. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Man </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the rise in gasoline futures largely reflects concern about whether supply will meet growing demand as the summer driving season approaches. `` Those concerns are globally,'' <PERSON> Lebow </PERSON> said. Supply worries escalated after an Exxon oil tanker spilled 10 million gallons of oil in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, last month, temporarily choking off crucial oil shipping lanes. In the three weeks following the March 24 spill, gasoline prices on the retail level jumped 10 to 30 cents a gallon across the country. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>, the May contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline jumped 2.06 cents to 72.08 cents a gallon Monday, after rising 1.21 cents on Friday. <PERSON> Lebow </PERSON> said Monday's closing price was the highest since the first quarter of 1986. The May contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, rose 53 cents to $ 21.22 a 42-gallon barrel, after a 40-cent increase on Friday. May wholesale home heating oil settled at 53.76 cents a gallon, up 0.85 cent. The contract had risen 0.77 cent Friday.

 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marketing firm said Monday it will sell 1,500 laptop computers made in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for use by reporters for <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Holographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> tried to block the $ 2.1 million sale of computers with Cyrillic keyboards but received <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> approval. The computers, made by <ORGANIZATION> Bondwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Fremont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, use <ORGANIZATION> Intel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s 80286 chip and are more powerful than the laptops most commonly used by American reporters. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> initially objected to the sale, citing the quantity of computers and complaining they were `` ruggedized'' for possible use in military situations. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Holographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION>, denied the charge. He said the deal went through recently after the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> failed to file a further objection following a recommendation for approval by Commerce. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who also is negotiating a joint venture with the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railways </ORGANIZATION> for a $ 20 million executive center and health fitness club for foreign executives, said the laptop sale took three months to get an export license. `` The government ought to find a way to expedite the licensing and get the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> out of some of these non-strategic items, like -LRB- personal computers -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` The Soviets can go to <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and get a license in seven days.''

 The dollar lost ground Monday against most other major currencies in worldwide foreign exchange trading tempered by anticipation of yet another report due Tuesday on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inflation. Gold prices edged up in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> trading after falling overseas. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted an after-hours bid for gold at $ 385.30 a troy ounce, up 30 cents from Friday's late bid. Traders have grown increasingly uncertain about the prospects for the dollar as recent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic reports provided an inconclusive view of the economy. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit widened in February, but the growth in producer prices slowed in March and the level of industrial production held steady. Traders were looking to Tuesday's scheduled release on the consumer price index for March to see if inflation is slowing. `` We wo n't see any major direction until we see the CPI number,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbanel </PERSON>, manager of futures trading at <ORGANIZATION> Gruntal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. He said trading was relatively quiet and there was no sign of central bank intervention in the currency markets. `` Foreign currencies are begining to generate an upswing and we may see a little bit of correction against the dollar in the short term. But in the long term, we still see the dollar relatively strong,'' he said. <PERSON> Barbanel </PERSON> said he did not think the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> would tighten credit conditions on the basis of a strong consumer price rise alone because the producer price figure showed slower growth in March. `` That gives short-term rates a respite for a while,'' he said. Rising <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates usually give the dollar a lift. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar fell to 131.83 Japanese yen from 132.55 yen on Friday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar was quoted at 131.70 yen. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar edged up to 132.155 yen from 132.05 yen late Friday. But the dollar finished lower against most other major currencies. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound rose to $ 1.7095 Monday from $ 1.7000 late Friday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the pound rose to $ 1.7133 from $ 1.7055 late Friday. Other dollar rates as of 4 p.m. in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late rates Friday, included: 1.8605 West German marks, down from 1.86525; 6.3005 French francs, down from 6.3090; 1.6405 Swiss francs, 1.6465; 1,366.35 Italian lire, down from 1,368.63; and 1.18495, down from 1.18605. Late rates for the dollar in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with Friday's late rates, included: 1.8565 West German marks, down from 1.8725; 1.6385 Swiss francs, down from 1.6510; 6.2825 French francs, down from 6.3350; 2.0953 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1145; 1,364.00 Italian lire, down from 1,374.25; 1.1855 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1875. On <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery edged up 20 cents a troy ounce to close at $ 386.20 an ounce. Earlier, gold traded at $ 385.00 a troy ounce in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, down from $ 386.50 late Friday. The late bid in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION> was $ 384.50 an ounce, down from $ 387.00 on Friday. In <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold closed at $ 385.65 an ounce, down from $ 382.65. Silver for current delivery rose to close at $ 5.811 an ounce on the Comex in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, up from $ 5.805 late Friday.

<HEAD>Palladium Prices Tumble; Profit-Taking Cited</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Palladium futures prices came crashing down Monday from 8-year highs as speculators took profits and lowered their expectations that nuclear fusion research would lead to explosive demand for the metal. Platinum futures also declined sharply while gold and silver advanced. On other markets, petroleum futures soared; grains and soybeans were sharply higher; and most livestock and meat futures also advanced. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, all palladium contracts except the spot April contract fell the permitted daily limit of $ 6 a troy ounce. The April contract, which has no limit pending its upcoming expiration, plunged $ 12.30 to $ 168.35 an ounce. Platinum settled $ 18 to $ 18.50 lower with July at $ 550.70 a troy ounce. Both metals were components in a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> chemistry experiment, announced on March 23, in which researchers claimed to have recreated in a bottle the elusive nuclear reaction that powers the sun and stars. The discovery raised hopes that nuclear fusion could become a major energy source. Last Thursday, palladium rocketed to an 8-year-high and platinum surged to its highest price in four months as other scientists replicated the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> experiment. But the speculative fever began cooling Friday and disappeared Monday morning amid media reports that the fusion research was not likely to create significantly stronger demand for palladium and platinum. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Demler </PERSON>, metals economist with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said both markets had become `` sorely overbought and due for a correction.'' Gold and silver futures inched higher on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Commodity Exchange in light, cautious trading ahead of Tuesday's government report on consumer price movement during April. Gold settled 20 cents to 30 cents higher with June at $ 390.10 a troy ounce; silver was 0.5 cent to 0.6 cent higher with May at $ 5.83 a troy ounce. Crude oil prices spurted above $ 21 a barrel on the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Merc </LOCATION> for the first time in 20 months. Analysts said the buying was inspired by chart signals rather than new supply-and-demand developments. The rally was led by the unleaded gasoline market, which has been moving higher since mid-February. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 8 cents to 53 cents higher with May at $ 21.22 a barrel; heating oil was .85 cent to 1.19 cents higher with May at 53.76 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 1.05 cents to 2.06 cents higher with May at 72.08 cents a gallon. Corn and soybean futures surged on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> amid forecasts for dry and much warmer weather in the western Corn Belt later this week. Many traders remember the dramatic price increases for corn and soybeans that accompanied last summer's drought, and each day without rain in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> bolsters the bullish trend despite the fact that farmers in the region have barely begun their spring planting. `` This is awfully early to be having a weather rally,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Leighty </PERSON>, a grain-market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Wheat settled 2 -LCB- cents lower to 3 -LCB- cents higher with May at $ 4.10 \ a bushel; corn was 5 -LCB- cents to 6 -LCB- cents higher with May at $ 2.76 -RCB- a bushel; oats were 5 cents to 7 \ cents higher with May at $ 1.99 a bushel; soybeans were 10 cents to 15 -LCB- cents higher with May at $ 7.47 \ Higher cash prices for fed cattle fueled a moderate rally in cattle futures prices on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and helped lift pork futures prices. Live cattle settled .20 cent to .62 cent higher with June at 71.32 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .18 cent to .65 cent higher with May at 76.45 cents a pound; live hogs were .03 cent lower to .55 cent higher with June at 46.62 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .32 cent to 1.20 cents higher with May at 33.62 cents a pound.

<DATELINE>DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 With fanfare and a closed-circuit broadcast, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> patted itself on the back Monday for the Mustang, introduced 25 years ago as an inexpensive sporty car that took the country by storm. `` It spawned a whole new class of cars,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsden </PERSON>, a professor of pop culture at <ORGANIZATION> Bowling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> who was on hand for the birthday party. `` The -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Chevrolet </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- Camaro would n't exist if the Mustang had n't come along.'' On April 17, 1964, about five weeks after the first one rolled off the line at the <LOCATION> Dearborn </LOCATION> assembly plant, the Mustang was introduced formally. Living up to the executives' promises, it weighed 2,570 pounds and cost $ 2,368. Since that day, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> has built and sold more than 5.7 million Mustangs, making millions of dollars off the cars. Its best sales year was in 1966, when 549,000 of the cars were sold. Its worst sales year was 1983, when 117,000 Mustangs were driven off dealers' lots The first Mustang, now in the <ORGANIZATION> Henry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dearborn </LOCATION>, was sold to an airplane pilot in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Johns </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION>, in April 1964. The pilot, <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> now of <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, was convinced by <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> to trade in Job 1 for Job 1,000,001 two years later, so that the original could be preserved. On Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> rolled out a vintage <PERSON> Mustang </PERSON> as officials and workers gathered to cut a cake in the shape of a <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> oval and topped by an edible model of a Mustang. Behind the ceremony, <PERSON> Mustangs </PERSON> continued to be assembled, at a rate of 52 an hour. The executives were brought to the plant's finishing area in <LOCATION> Mustangs </LOCATION>, of course, to the beat of <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickett </PERSON>'s tune `` <PERSON> Mustang </PERSON> <PERSON> Sally </PERSON>.'' The ceremony was telecast live to all <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> plants in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> through an in-house broadcast system. Plant Manager <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Callaway </PERSON>, who began his <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> career at the <LOCATION> Dearborn </LOCATION> assembly plant and got a rousing cheer Monday when he stepped from a new Mustang, said in an interview before the birthday party there was a feeling that the car would do well even before it was introduced. `` You can always tell when a car is going to be successful,'' he said, `` because the employees are excited about it.'' One of the employees there when the first Mustang rolled off the line, and who is still working at the plant is <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Bevins </PERSON>, 62, whose enthusiasm for the car continues. `` We make the best cars in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Bevins </PERSON>, whose family has had three <ORGANIZATION> Mustangs </ORGANIZATION> _ a blue 1966, a blue'78 and a brown'80. They were all driven by other members of his family. `` I have a'77 -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` I refer to it as my truck.''

<TEXT>
 A federal judge Monday refused to modify an order preventing the free world's largest gold concern, South Africa-linked <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.A. </ORGANIZATION>, from acquiring any more shares of No. 2 gold producer <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fields </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>. The decision by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mukasey </PERSON> continues a preliminary injunction he issued last October barring <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> from acquiring the 70.4 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fields </ORGANIZATION> shares it does n't already own Last fall, <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> corporation largely controlled by two South African concerns, <ORGANIZATION> Anglo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> De </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, launched a $ 4.9 billion hostile takeover bid _ since upped to $ 6 billion _ for <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fields </ORGANIZATION>. But Gold Fields, a British concern, resisted and filed an antitrust action in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, claiming that a takeover could result in <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION>'s `` dominating the strategically important world gold market.'' `` This court enjoined the takeover because the resulting combination would control 32.3 percent of the non-communist world gold market,'' <PERSON> Mukasey </PERSON> said in a 45-page opinion issued Monday. <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION>, through its various holdings, is the largest gold producer in the West, accounting for 20.3 percent of all production. Gold Fields, with about a 12 percent share, is the second-largest, according to court papers. <PERSON> Mukasey </PERSON>'s injunction also prevents <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> from selling its Gold Fields holdings to other entities within the South African conglomerate without court approval. <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> sought to modify the injunction, allowing it to complete its acquisition of Gold Fields while promising to sell off certain <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, Australian and South African assets within a year to resolve antitrust allegations made by Gold Fields. But <PERSON> Mukasey </PERSON> rejected that bid saying there was no guarantee that <ORGANIZATION> Anglo </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> DeBeers </ORGANIZATION> would n't eventually repurchase the divested concerns because South African laws enable companies there `` to conceal the source of their overseas investments in order to avoid the effects of anti-apartheid laws.'' Last month, a federal appeals court upheld <PERSON> Mukasey </PERSON>'s preliminary injunction on antitrust grounds and ordered him to consider whether the takeover bid violates <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> securities laws. In Monday's ruling, however, <PERSON> Mukasey </PERSON> rejected Gold Fields' claims that <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> had failed to fully disclose its South African interests in violation of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> securities laws Gold Fields sought to widen the scope of the injunction by claiming <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> violated the anti-fraud provisions of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> securities laws, for allegedly `` making and false and misleading statements'' about how much control South African corporations and individuals have over it. Gold Fields claimed the Oppenheimer family of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> indirectly controls <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Anglo </ORGANIZATION> American and <ORGANIZATION> DeBeers </ORGANIZATION> and that the stigma of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s apartheid racial policy could make it difficult to conduct business in some countries. But <PERSON> Mukasey </PERSON> found those claims were only part of a delaying tactic to push <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION>'s offer past its April 26 deadline, which under British law would bar it from renewing its bid for more than a year. Gold Fields has significant gold mining holdings in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, including 90 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Newmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION>, the largest gold producer in the country.

 <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> will stick to making personal computers for the mass market rather than going upscale in the battle against invaders like <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Microsystems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sculley </PERSON> said Monday. <PERSON> Sculley </PERSON> said some hot new technologies are too expensive and untried to be offered by <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> itself, although other companies may offer them as add-ons to the popular Apple Macintosh. Apple will offer the new technologies on the Macintosh once they become cheaper and better accepted, he said. As examples he cited artificial intelligence and digital signal processing chips, which take voices and video signals and turn them into code that can be acted on by a computer. <PERSON> Sculley </PERSON> appeared to be staking out the middle ground of the personal computer market as <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION>'s own, putting less emphasis on the high ground where <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> faces its sternest competition. <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Microsystems </ORGANIZATION> last week unveiled a family of low-priced Sparcstation computers that can zoom through more than 12 million instructions per second. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Jobs </PERSON>, who co-founded <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> and went on to create <ORGANIZATION> Next </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, is pitching a speedy Next workstation that comes in an elegant black magnesium box. <PERSON> Sculley </PERSON> said he does not foresee a collision between personal computers and workstations, which are cousins of PCs that cost more, run faster and have superior graphics. `` There are a lot of things you have to do to be successful in the personal computer industry beyond offering hardware under $ 10,000,'' <PERSON> Sculley </PERSON> said in a news conference. Sun's compact Sparcstation starts at less than $ 9,000. But <PERSON> Sculley </PERSON> said it is still about twice the price of the new Macintosh IIcx, which he described in an earlier speech as possibly the company's best computer ever. And he said software for the Sun machine is much more expensive than Macintosh software. Still, analysts say the Sun and Next machines are tough competition for the most expensive Apple models, such as the Macintosh IIx, which sells for $ 10,000 to $ 12,000. `` That's one of the reasons they want to emphasize the mid-range of the products. The competition is getting pretty fierce at the high end,'' said <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Lederman </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Duff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phelps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. She said she was concerned that waiting too long to put new technologies into the Macintosh could leave Apple playing catch-up `` I do n't think they're really any longer at the forefront of technology.'' <PERSON> Sculley </PERSON> gave the keynote address at the <ORGANIZATION> Macintosh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exposition </ORGANIZATION>, which was billed as the biggest Macintosh event ever in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. He followed the speech with a news conference.

 The stock market closed mixed in one of the slowest trading days of the year Monday, as investors hibernated to await more news on the economy. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 0.73 point to 2,337.79 after opening more than 4 points lower. In the broader market, declining issues narrowly outnumbered advancers in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 762 issues down, 697 up and 521 unchanged. Stocks initially fell on profit-taking in the wake of Friday's surge in prices, rebounded briefly then drifted through the remainder of the session as players retreated to await a government report Tuesday on consumer prices Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 128.54 million shares, the fifth slowest trading day of the year, down from 169.78 million in the previous session. Analysts said despite Friday's price rally after a report that March producer prices rose 0.4 percent, market participants preferred to remain cautious ahead of new statistics on the consumer price index. `` After the party on Friday and the CPI tomorrow, people are just taking the day off,'' said <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> A.G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. `` They do n't want to come in tomorrow and be hit with a <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> left hook.'' The market interpreted the producer price rise as a sign of easing inflationary pressures after rises of 1 percent in each of the previous two months. Stock analysts said the market is expecting a rise of between 0.4 percent and 0.6 percent in the March CPI, which measures cost of living, after a 0.4 percent increase in February. Even before trading slowed, analysts said activity was light with many participants taking the week off in preparation for the Jewish holiday of Passover on Wednesday. `` That tends to lower the volume as people close out positions,'' said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Puccio </PERSON>, senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Dillon </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Read </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` They want to get out of the week relatively unscathed.'' With the exception of individual stocks, no one particular sector stood out, traders said. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 155.002 million shares. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market rose $ 2.61 billion, or 0.09 percent, in value. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks rose 0.16 to 169.05.

<TEXT>
 Rising sales in <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s automotive and information systems segments helped lead to a first-quarter earnings increase of 4 percent, the company said Monday. <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION> said earnings during the period that ended March 31 totaled $ 69 million or $ 1.12 a share, up from $ 66 million or $ 1.07 during the same quarter a year ago. `` Each of our major segments reported operating profits equal to or better than the year-earlier period when we experienced particularly strong results,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer. `` This quarter's earnings improvement was attained in what we believe was a much tougher competitive environment.'' <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION> said sales in its space and defense segment dropped 5 percent from $ 815 to $ 775 million because of previously announced program changes and reductions. However, operating profit in that segment rose nearly 2 percent from $ 58 million to $ 59 million, the company said. Sales in the automotive segment rose 10 percent from $ 787 million to $ 868 million, <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION> said, attributing the increase to improved business in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Operating profit in the segment remained at $ 745 million, <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION> said. In the information systems segment, sales rose 12 percent from $ 126 million to $ 141 million, <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION> said. It noted particularly strong performances in the consumer credit reporting and image-based data processing businesses. Operating profit rose 51 percent from $ 9 million to $ 13 million in information systems, the company said. <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION>, which provides high technology produces and services, said sales overall for the quarter dropped 1 percent from $ 1.8 billion to $ 1.79 billion. Excluding sales for businesses divested last year, sales rose 4 percent, <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION> said.

 A federal bankruptcy judge gave <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and its creditors an extra week Monday to invite buyers and explore a possible breakup, but parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said the strike-strapped airline was n't for sale. The developments added a new twist to the Miami-based airline's tortuous labor crisis, now in its seventh week, and suggested a solution was growing more elusive `` As time goes by there are fewer alternatives to explore,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> told a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> courtroom crammed with about 50 uniformed pilots and lawyers for <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, creditors and the unions. `` This airline is hemorrhaging,'' he said. `` It is not tolerable that this process be so lengthy that the parties have nothing left to consider.'' <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, an attorney for the pilots union, told a news conference that <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> `` appears to be in an especial state of disarray,'' with the company and its lawyers giving conflicting signals about their planned course of action. <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> held a hearing to determine why he should n't put the entire airline up for sale, including assets held by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> before <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> acquired it three years ago for about $ 676 million. Lawyers for <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and its creditors talked him into giving them an extra week to study alternatives, over the objection of attorneys for the unions and a dissident creditor, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Moreton </PERSON> <PERSON> Rolleston </PERSON>, Jr. They have been pushing for more aggressive court action to get Eastern flying again, either through a sale or the appointment of an outside trustee to run the airline. After the hearing, lawyers for <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and the pilots union said there was another possible bidder besides the three previously known: ex-baseball boss <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>, hotelier <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON> and takeover investor <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>. They would n't identify the fourth bidder. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>, the bankruptcy examiner for <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, described the fourth bidder to the lawyers involved as `` a group of substantial capital willing and able to do the transaction.'' <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> told the lawyers Monday he had been in contact with all four potential suitors, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said. The judge's order meant that during the week, potential buyers would gain access to confidential financial data concerning Eastern in exchange for their pledge to keep the information secret, participants in the case said. <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Zweibel </PERSON>, the lead attorney for the 15-member committee representing <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s creditors, said the Miami-based airline has agreed to provide the necessary financial documents. `` There might be someone who's interested at the right price,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, however, said its directors had decided not to pursue the sale of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> but will consider selling `` a substantial part of the company's assets'' to pay down debts. The <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> board's statement essentially sanctioned <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> management's decision announnced last Wednesday, after a deal with <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> collapsed, to reduce <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> to about 60 percent of its pre-strike size. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> said the statement was unrelated to <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON>'s hearing. Eastern workers have been on strike since March 4, charging <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> boss <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> has butchered it and plotted to destroy their unions by transferring valuable assets to sister carrier <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> put Eastern into bankruptcy court refuge March 9 and sought a buyer. <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> nearly completed a $ 464 million deal to buy <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> but the sale flopped over a dispute between the unions and <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> over who would run the airline until <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>'s investor group could assume control Sources familiar with the Eastern situation have said <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> remains interested in making a new offer. <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON>, owner of the Hyatt hotel chain, and <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, owner and chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, also have been lurking in the background as possible buyers. The Lifland hearing was jammed with interested bystanders. Among them was former <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Acker </PERSON>, who declined to say why he was there.

<HEAD>California Court Revives Suit Against Oil Companies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal appeals court on Monday allowed the state of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to go to trial with claims that six major oil companies conspired to depress the price of oil they pumped from state-owned tidelands in <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. The suits in federal and state court claim losses to the state and the city of <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> totaling $ 789 million in 1971-77 and 1980-85. Damages tripled under antitrust law would exceed $ 2.3 billion, and could be increased further by $ 2,500-a-day penalties sought under state unfair-competition laws. Most of the claimed losses were to the state, which uses tidelands oil money for school construction. The city of <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> gets a small fraction of the oil money. The 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> voted 3-0 to reinstate the suits, which had been dismissed by U.S. District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The suits accuse the six companies _ <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> _ of holding down the prices they paid for heavy crude oil while agreeing secretly to exchange oil among themselves at higher prices. A seventh defendant, <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Richfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, settled in 1984 by paying $ 22.5 million. Still pending before the appellate court is an appeal by <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and four other states from a ruling by <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> dismissing a separate antitrust suit against the same seven oil companies, which accuses them of conspiring to create a gasoline shortage and fix gasoline prices in the early 1970s. In Monday's ruling, the court said the state and city had presented enough evidence to proceed to trial with claims that the oil companies conspired to keep artificially low the prices they paid to <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> for heavy crude oil. <PERSON> Royce </PERSON> <PERSON> Schulz </PERSON>, a lawyer for the city, said retail prices for oil products in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> were about the same as those elsewhere in the period, an indication that the companies' actions did n't help consumers. `` Refiners simply pocketed that profit,'' he said. The suits contend the companies agreed secretly in the early 1960s, at meetings involving all of them except <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>, to keep the posted price for heavy crude below its real value, while exchanging different grades of oil among themselves at higher rates. Lawyers for <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> said the elaborate exchange procedure, unique to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, was disclosed by a state auditor in 1973 but was being used as late as 1984. Types of oil `` were used as a currency _ a medium of exchange and a new value system _ reserved to the majors -LRB- oil companies -RRB- and kept secret from the state and the city,'' <PERSON> Schulz </PERSON> said in a `` background paper'' on the case. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Halling </PERSON>, another partner in <PERSON> Schulz </PERSON>'s firm, said the secrecy of the exchange system let the oil companies evade a provision of their contract with <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> that required them to pay the city the highest price they paid any other seller of oil. But <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Destino </PERSON>, a lawyer for <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>, said the exchange system simply allowed oil companies to move their product to market while guaranteeing that they would get equal value when trading the same grade of oil from different sources. The appeals court said the exchange system did not amount to price-fixing by itself but could point to the existence of a conspiracy. `` At various times, market conditions should have caused some of the companies to post higher crude prices,'' said the opinion by Judge <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Farris </PERSON>. `` Posted prices did not correspond to market value.'' <PERSON> Farris </PERSON> also rejected <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>'s conclusion that federal price controls and other regulations during the 1971-77 period made it impossible for the city and state to show any damages, even if they could prove a price-fixing conspiracy.

 <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, trying to block a $ 1.15 billion takeover by a rival poultry processor, said Monday it failed to convince its stockholders to approve a merger <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> managers proposed with <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and would abandon the idea. <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Farms </PERSON> said a preliminary count showed that only 32.5 percent of its stock was voted in favor of the merger with <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> and 47.8 percent against it. The tally was taken Friday with a two-thirds affirmative vote required. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> vice president, said <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> notified <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> on Monday that the merger was off. <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> directors announced the proposed merger with <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, Neb.-based <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> last November to ward off a takeover by <ORGANIZATION> Tyson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Springdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark </LOCATION>. `` They had to have a two-thirds vote and they did n't even get one-third,'' <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Blair </PERSON>, general counsel for <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>, said of the shareholder voting. `` I would hope the Holly board would start paying a little attention to the wishes of their shareholders. I think this is a mandate to take our deal.'' The merger agreement included a provision aimed at allowing <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> to purchase key <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> assets in the event the merger failed. The `` asset-option agreement'' remains in effect, though it has been temporarily blocked by <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on a challenge by <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said. The court also blocked another provision of the merger proposal requiring <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> to pay <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> $ 15 million, plus expenses, if the deal failed. <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> vice president, said his company's expenses for the merger attempt total $ 5 million <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> still is interested in <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION>, but he declined to say if his company will make a higher offer to counter <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>. Tyson is offering <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> stockholders $ 63.50 a share in cash for their 18.1 million shares. The offer is contingent, however, on removal of the asset-option agreement between <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> merger, which would have made <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> a <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, called for a $ 1.1 billion stock swap worth about $ 61 a share. `` The board will be meeting and reviewing alternatives available to shareolders and will be asking that the shareholders do nothing in respect to their stock until they hear from the board,'' <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Tyson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> is the nation's largest poultry processor and <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION>, a diversified company, is heavily involved in fresh poultry sales. <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> is one of the largest food companies in the country with revenues of $ 9.4 billion last year. The asset-option agreement between <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> allows <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> to purchase about one-third of <PERSON> Holly </PERSON>'s assets at prices already negotiated if the <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> company is bought by anyone else within the next nine months. <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> contends the asset agreement was an illegal attempt to make <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> unattractive to any buyer other than <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> judge hearing <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>'s suit has blocked any execution of the asset agreement until the legal disputes surrounding it are settled.

 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission on Monday gave a <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> nuclear plant permission to resume operations, two years after it was shut down because 33 control room operators slept on the job or neglected their duties. The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> voted 3-0 to lift an order that had kept the Peach Bottom nuclear plant closed since March 31, 1987, when the commission said its continued operation Posed a threat `` to the health and safety of the public.'' In granting permission to restart the facility, the commission nevertheless warned the plant operator against complacency. `` We will be watching you very closely,'' said <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lando </PERSON> <PERSON> Zech </PERSON>. Plant officials must complete a checklist of technical items before bringing the plant to full power, which will take several months and be scrutinized by <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> inspectors. The vote followed a presentation by <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the plant operator, which said it had undergone radical changes since the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> issued its order following a tip about the sleeping that prompted an investigation. The changes successfully addressed the `` root causes'' of the problem, the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> staff said in recommending that the commission permit the plant to restart. Those problems had included a lax Peach Bottom `` culture'' in which plant problems either were ignored or unnoticed by top managers, the staff said. `` It would at least appear to me that management -LRB- before the shutdown -RRB- either was not aware of conditions or, if they were aware of it, they condoned it,'' <PERSON> Zech </PERSON> said before the vote. `` The operators must never again betray the special trust and countenance of the public,'' <PERSON> Zech </PERSON> said. `` We will be watching you very closely.'' <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> was out of the country, and missed the vote. Commissioner <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> did not vote because he once served on the <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> board, the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> said. The shutdown cost the company about $ 250 million in plant modifications, purchases of replacement power and its share of a $ 1.25 million fine, the largest in <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> history. Many of the problems at Peach Bottom occured on the overnight, or `` graveyard'' shift. On at least two occasions, according to <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> testimony in 1987, three of the four control room employees responsible for running the plant were asleep at the same time. Another time, several of the operators were found huddled around a personal computer playing video games. Of 39 control room operators now at the plant, 24 were there at the time of the shutdown, and all have been retrained. To end catnaps by operators, plant officials also replaced comfortable, high-backed chairs in the control room with low-backed models. In another development, meanwhile, <PERSON> Zech </PERSON> indicated the committee would vote Thursday on awarding a full-power license to the <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> nuclear plant on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, after hearing the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> staff report that the $ 5.5 billion reactor is safe and ready to operate. All indications are that the full-power license will be awarded, but whether it will ever be used is doubtful. The <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lighting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> is one step away from selling the plant to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state for $ 1 in exchange for a decade of annual rate increases of up to 5 percent. The state would then decommission and dismantle the plant. <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors is recommending that shareholders approve the plan to shut the plant. The final step to ratifying the settlement is a vote by <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> shareholders on or before June 15. In the meantime, <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> has agreed not to operate the plant even if it receives a 25 percent or full-power license before then. Shoreham, which was completed in 1984, 13 years behind schedule, received a low-power testing license in 1985. But <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> was thwarted in its quest for an operating license because the state and local governments refused to participate in emergency planning, contending that area around the plant could not be safely evacuated in the event of a nuclear emergency. In late 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> changed its rules to allow utilities to prepare their own evacuation plans assuming that in the event of a real emergency, state and local governments would live up to their responsibilities and participate. <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> finally removed <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION>'s last obstacles to a license _ the state and local governments _ by dismissing them as legal intervenors before the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>.

 Monday's midnight deadline for filing federal income tax returns brought the usual deluge of last-minute mailings as people held onto their money as long as possible, or procrastinated until time ran out. The <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> took a tip from the fast food industry in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, where traffic was directed through the front parking lot of the city's main post office so people could drive through and hand their completed returns to postal workers stationed outside. `` Any returns we get by midnight, we'll make sure they get postmarked on the 17th,'' said <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Rinehart </PERSON>, a mail processing clerk at the <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> main post office. People making the mad dash to beat the mailing deadline were offered entertainment or moral support to improve their mood in some cities. At <LOCATION> Lawrence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Lawrence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barnstorm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cloggers </ORGANIZATION> band was to perform at the post office from 10 p.m. until midnight, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mackey </PERSON>. `` We just want to lift people's spirits,'' <PERSON> Mackey </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, rock station <ORGANIZATION> KLSX-FM </ORGANIZATION> offered coffee and donuts at the downtown Terminal Annex, the city's main mail processing center, which posted buckets at curbside until midnight. `` We want to add some merriment and not make the people feel bad that they're procrastinators,'' said <ORGANIZATION> KLSX </ORGANIZATION> disc jockey <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Tilden </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, a performance art group called <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stimulus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Response </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> prepared a show for its fourth annual Tax-a-thon outside the city's main post office. `` At midnight, we release balloons and scream ` It's too late!''' said <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON>, one of the participants. `` It's a touching moment. The feeling that they've got your money and there's nothing you can do about it.'' In some cities, protesters used the day to demonstrate against the use of income tax money for military purposes. Members of the Northern California War Tax Resistance, based in <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, distributed $ 6,000 to various charities, saying the money came from people who refuse to pay all or part of their federal taxes because the money is used for `` war and war preparations.'' Actually, not everyone had to have their returns in the mail by midnight Monday. Residents of <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> got an extra day this year because Monday was a holiday, Patriots' Day, in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. Residents of those states mail their returns to the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> office at <LOCATION> Andover </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. But for the rest of the country, April 17 was the deadline because April 15 fell on the weekend. <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> <PERSON> Drake </PERSON>, a district manager who oversees 18 <ORGANIZATION> H </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> R </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Block </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> offices in <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, said that when he assured worried clients that they had not missed the filing deadline, `` it was like people on death row finding out they had gotten a reprieve.'' Whatever the deadline, <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> Form 4868 _ request for a filing extension _ is the most-requested form this late in the season, said <PERSON> Roslyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> office in South Bend, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>. Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> center at <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said they expected to receive the majority of the 11.4 million returns from central and southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> regions by Wednesday. As of last week, the center had received 5.9 million returns. But the deluge of work does n't mean <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> workers do n't have time for an occasional smile. In the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> offices, laughs have sprung from requests for Form 911, which is reserved for taxpayers who cite unusual circumstances in requesting a speedy refund or relief from paying taxes, said <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Hubenak </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>. `` One person in particular was trying to get us to speed up the refund check because he had pawned his tools, and wanted us to call the pawnbroker and explain it to him,'' <PERSON> Hubenak </PERSON> said. `` Another asked that they call a grocery store and say the check was on the way.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> will hire 4,000 people to scrub at least 305 miles of shoreline fouled by <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s worst oil spill, and says the job can be finished by the third week in August, according to a plan released Monday. The cleanup can be be completed by August if a hot-water cleaning method that can damge beach life is used aggressively, or by mid-September if environmentally safer methods play a larger role, the draft plan says. Those projections were disputed by a state ecologist, who said after reviewing the plan that only about 150 miles could be cleaned before winter. And the top state environmental official called for the plan to be broadened to include areas where the oil has spread outside Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. `` It's a start,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelso </PERSON>. `` It needs more work.'' The plan estimates that by June 1 the company will have 2,500 Alaskans working on the shoreline, with 1,500 other people in support roles. It says 11 barges, 28 landing vessels, 150 utility ships, and six wash-vacuum ships will be used. According to the plan, the total shoreline in Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> affected by the March 24 <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> wreck is 366 miles _ about the distance from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, or <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz </LOCATION>. Concentration of oil on the beach runs from 1,260 gallons to 12,600 gallons per mile, with an average of 4,200 gallons per mile, the oil company said. The plan said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> so far has recovered 924,000 gallons, or 9 percent, of the spilled oil. The plan proposes to clean up 305 miles. It estimates that 54 miles are heavily oiled, 86 moderately oiled and 165 lightly oiled. It assumes that needed permits will be promptly issued and that no additional oil will wash ashore. But <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Haavig </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> estimated after reviewing the plan that crews would be able to scrape and spray greasy black sludge from only about one mile of beach per day. `` A mile a day is optimistic,'' <PERSON> Haavig </PERSON> said. At most, there are 150 days from the time workers and gear are mobilized, two or three weeks from now, until winter descends in September. <PERSON> Haavig </PERSON> said crews might make good time on lightly oiled beaches, but the more heavily polluted stretches will slow them. Asked for comment, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanczuk </PERSON> said the company wanted to confer first with the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> commandant, Adm. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Yost </PERSON>, who was sent by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to hasten the cleanup. <PERSON> Kelso </PERSON>, in a letter to <PERSON> Yost </PERSON>, demanded that <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> improve its cleanup of oil still in the water. He said the company should come up with a plan by April 25 to clean beaches beyond Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, where the oil has spread. He said he also wants data on how to manage and dispose of wastes. Meanwhile, wildlife officials brought grim reports from the <LOCATION> Nuka </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nuka </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area on the <LOCATION> Kenai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, about 175 miles southwest of where the Exxon Valdez smashed into <LOCATION> Bligh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reef </LOCATION>. `` They found a lot of dead birds and a lot of live, oiled birds,'' <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Seaman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION> and Game said in Homer. `` There's otter tracks on every beach.'' Part of the herring grounds at the north end of the <LOCATION> Kodiak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> remained closed Monday because of oil sightings. It was feared the more important herring fishery at <LOCATION> Kamishak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> might not be able to begin as scheduled later this week. Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> lies south of <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, the seaport where the trans-Alaska oil pipeline ends. Until the spill, its waters and islands had been among the most scenic in the nation, and few places in the world are richer in wildlife and fish. <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> spent part of Sunday at <LOCATION> Block </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in the sound, where muck was puddled ankle-deep in places. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> had assembled state and federal officials and reporters for a demonstration of cleanup methods, including an environmentally risky steam-cleaning technique that sterilizes the shore. <PERSON> Haavig </PERSON> also was on <LOCATION> Block </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, checking the depth of the beach contamination. In some places, the oil had soaked in only an inch. In others, it was found several inches deep. `` They're never going to get it all,'' he said. In <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, meanwhile, state environmental chief <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said the crippled <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> appeared sound enough to make it to the Port of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> for evaluation. He said he expected <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> to agree to several conditions before officials allow the tanker to travel up the <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Dollar Higher, Stocks Off</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Updates with Morning Nikkei, comments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar traded higher against the Japanese yen at midday Tuesday, while the key index on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> posted a moderate loss. The dollar, which opened at 132.23 yen, up 0.40 yen from Monday's 131.83-yen finish, was quoted at 132.20 yen at midday. The currency moved in a narrow range of 132.10-132 .27 yen The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained 157.89 points to close at a record-high 33,308.33 Monday, ended the morning session at 33,254.49, down 53.84 points or 0.16 percent. The index rose marginally in early morning trading but began falling as investors sold for profit taking, said <PERSON> Tsuneo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishii </PERSON> with <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. `` That's mainly because participants were concerned about the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consumer price index report to be released later tonight and avoided buying,'' he said. Later Tuesday, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was to announce the March <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consumer price index, which measures changes in the retail prices of a constant market basket of goods and services. Investors also were discouraged by concerns over the Recruit bribery scandal, dealers said. Prosecutors are expected to make more arrests this week in connection with the affair. So far, prosecutors have arrested 14 people in connection with stock profiteering and suspected bribery linked to a major information services firm, <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. In currency dealings, the dollar-yen rate was moving little as market players avoided making major moves ahead of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> CPI </ORGANIZATION> announcement, traders said.
