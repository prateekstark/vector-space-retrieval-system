 The widow of the Panamanian major who led an unsuccessful coup against Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> says it failed because her husband was betrayed by another major who switched sides at the last minute, according to a published report. Countering what <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have been saying, <PERSON> Adela </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonilla </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON> is quoted by the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> in its Thursday editions as saying that the coup was `` very well organized and coldly calculated.'' She said her husband, Maj. <PERSON> Moises </PERSON> <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON> <PERSON> Vega </PERSON>, had worked with Maj. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Olechea </PERSON>, commander of the elite Battalion 2000, in planning the coup. Instead of being used to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, however, Battalion 2000 was airlifted 55 miles from the scene of the fighting and led <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s troops in crushing the coup. `` Everything was ready. But <PERSON> Olechea </PERSON> was playing a winner's game and he failed to come through because of his cowardice. He committed treason,'' she told the Times in an interview conducted in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. In a television interview with <ORGANIZATION> WTVJ </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, she said she warned her husband of the perils of the attempted coup. `` I told him ` Think of what you're doing.' I said, ` If you're going to do that, you're going to have to kill him. `` He said, ` I do n't think that will be necessary. If things get difficult, we'll give him over to the Americans. If not, we'll retire him under house arrest,''' she said She says her husband had wanted help from the Americans, but military bureaucracy may have prevented that help from arriving in time, she told the station. She said the battle with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> will continue, and her husband's death could be a catalyst. `` Where -LRB- <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON> -RRB- is now, he is OK,'' she told <ORGANIZATION> WTVJ </ORGANIZATION>. `` He's with God. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, not even hell wants him. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> does n't want him. Hell does n't want him. So, where will he go?'' Mrs. <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON>, airlifted from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, is staying with her children and invalid mother at a secret location in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. She was not at military headquarters during the coup attempt on Oct. 3 and her information came from officers who took part in the coup and fled to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the Times said. She said she believed the coup would have succeeded had it not been for <PERSON> Olechea </PERSON>, whose battalion would have provided the firepower to topple <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, she told the newspaper. <PERSON> Olechea </PERSON> `` turned sides at the last moment'' although <PERSON> Olechea </PERSON> and her husband `` were good friends and had talked several times about this coup'' she said. She also said that three captains who were supposed to persuade <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to surrender `` did n't do it because they were cowards.'' Her lends credence to reports that officers held <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> for up to five hours as they argued whether to turn him over to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. While the captains argued, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> slipped into a separate room and telephoned for help and the coup was crushed. Mrs. <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> `` himself assassinated my husband.'' `` My husband could have killed <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, but he would not do that. He thought the commander's fate should be decided by the people,'' not the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, she told the paper. Mrs. <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON> did not have firsthand evidence that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> killed her husband, the paper said. She confirmed that she had approached <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials and told them that a coup attempt was imminent and that the sealing of roads by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces would help her husband's attempt. She told the Times that the coup attempt was hatched by junior officers who were fed up with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who she said `` always seemed drunk.'' `` My husband told me that most of the time <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was operative only an hour a day,'' she said, adding that it was widely believed that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> drank heavily and used amphetamines. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is very bright, she told the Times. `` The next time, he has to be the first to be killed,'' she said.

 More than 150,000 Chicagoans voted to elect local school councils Wednesday as part of sweeping reforms that will give parents more control of an education system labeled the worst in the nation. At issue is the quality of learning in a system whose 410,000 students make it the nation's third largest, but whose low test scores and high dropout rates in 1987 caused then-Education Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> to brand it the nation's worst. The final tally is expected to show that more than 30 percent of the parents voted in the elections, school officials said. An early tally of votes cast showed that 150,401 people voted. Officials said that included 70,053 parents, 55,319 community residents and 25,029 ballots cast by <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> staff members. Officials said there were a number of reports of irregularities in the balloting, most caused by inexperienced election judges and ballots at some schools that had more than 20 candidates. `` I want to be part of the reform _ I think this is one way of having a solution to the problems in the schools of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. I feel it's a responsibility of the parents,'' said <PERSON> Nacer </PERSON> <PERSON> Boundaoui </PERSON>, who voted at <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Healey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, where his son attends first grade. <PERSON> Boundaoui </PERSON> led his 4-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Assia </PERSON>, into the school gymnasium and stood behind a wooden screen hiding a metal school desk, where he marked his vote on a paper ballot. The elections _ Wednesday at the city's 469 elementary schools and Thursday at 71 public high schools _ were part of a reform package passed last year by the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. Reform also included cutting administrative jobs and shifting money in the $ 2.26-billion school budget to educating low-income students. Community activists spent weeks trying to mobilize residents to vote, but predicted a 50 percent turnout among parents with children in school. <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Saigh </PERSON> said that turnout was low by late afternoon, but was expected to improve by the time polls closed. The 17,256 candidates sought 5,400 unpaid positions on the 540 councils, each of which will include six parents, two teachers and two community residents without schoolchildren. School staffs will elect the teacher members. The 11th member of each council will be the principal of the school or schools the council oversees. The councils, scheduled to begin their monthly meetings within a week of the elections, will have authority to hire and fire principals, develop school-improvement plans and spend money. The councils would receive much of the authority previously vested in the school system's central bureaucracy, headed by a superintendent and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>. The old board of mayoral appointees was scrapped under the plan and a seven-member interim board, also appointed by the mayor, is running the system. Ultimately, a 15-member permanent board will be named by the mayor, following screenings by citizens' panels. At <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> McClellan </PERSON> school, Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> was one of about 60 people who had voted by 11 a.m. `` I'd like to have them coming in, but it's slow,'' said election judge <PERSON> Alfreda </PERSON> <PERSON> McLain </PERSON>, surveying the empty polling place at <PERSON> McClellan </PERSON>. `` Maybe they do n't understand that they should help the public schools.'' A survey by Designs for Change, an education research and advisory council that helped shape the reform package, found that nearly equal numbers of candidates came from low-income neighborhoods as middle-class sections of the city. Participation was as high at mostly black and Hispanic schools as at integrated schools, the survey found.

 The ex-warden of the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penitentiary </LOCATION> was fired for lax security, not reporting escapes and operating a cockfighting business at the prison, the state's corrections chief said Wednesday <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, who has been on leave since in August, was fired Tuesday for eight violations of department policy that alleged administrative malfeasance, said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON>, secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION>. `` I was going to give him the opportunity to retire. ...

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Lyphomed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has been distributing its drug pentamidine, used to combat AIDS-linked pneumonia, free to poor patients, the company said Wednesday. The company announced its plans to give away the drug in February, but the actual distribution was held up until after the drug won full government approval in June, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsden </PERSON>. Community health organizations have been notified of the availablity of pentamidine for the poor and for those who lacked insurance to cover its costs. Ms. <PERSON> Marsden </PERSON> said there have been no recent talks within the company about reducing the cost of the drug to the paying public. <ORGANIZATION> Lyphomed </ORGANIZATION>, based in suburban <LOCATION> Rosemont </LOCATION>, has been accused by AIDS activists and others of overcharging for the substance. <ORGANIZATION> Lyphomed </ORGANIZATION>'s action represents the first time a company has distributed an approved drug to poor patients free of charge, company officials and <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. Since 1984, <ORGANIZATION> Lyphomed </ORGANIZATION> has produced an injectable form of the drug for use in patients who already have contracted pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, a life-threatening form of pneumonia that is the leading cause of death among AIDS patients. In June, the company obtained approval for marketing an aerosol version to be taken once every four weeks as a preventive measure by people likely to contract that form of pneumonia. <ORGANIZATION> Lyphomed </ORGANIZATION> charges about $ 100 wholesale for a monthly dose. Patients pay up to $ 200 for the same dose through doctors and pharmacies. Last month, the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> With </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AIDS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> said it would import the drug from <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, where is it cheaper, and sell it to AIDS patients in this country at a lower cost that the drug can be bought here. <ORGANIZATION> Lyphomed </ORGANIZATION> said its charge is appropriate, given the research money it spent developing the drug.

<TEXT>
 Three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Roman Catholic archbishops said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should negotiate directly with Palestinians over `` territory and sovereignty,'' and criticized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for alleged human rights abuse. The joint statement by Archbishops <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahony </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Keeler </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> and Cardinal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> also called on <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> to leave <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Their statement, to be presented to the nation's 300 bishops, asked the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to take more action in negotiating a peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> that meets the security needs of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the `` long-denied rights'' of Palestinians. But it also called on Palestinians to pursue `` sovereign co-existence'' with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` The key to successful political dialogue will be Palestinians willing to discuss secure boundaries and stable political relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and Israelis willing to discuss territory and sovereignty with Palestinians,'' the statement said. `` We feel as Christian leaders in the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> community that we have a responsibility to ... pull factions that have been in conflict together, to be instruments of peace,'' said <PERSON> Mahony </PERSON>, chairman of the committee that drew up the statement. `` We see this as a moral challenge. There is a better way to live.'' The statement, `` Toward Peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>: Problems and Principles,'' will be presented to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION>' fall meeting Nov. 6-9 in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. Rabbi <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudin </PERSON>, national interreligious affairs director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Banki </PERSON>, his associate, said they were troubled by the bishops' `` premature'' support for Palestinian sovereignty. They also said that in criticizing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s handling of the Palestinian uprising, the prelates failed to give equal weight `` to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s very real problems and legitimate rights in maintaining order in the territories,'' and a 40-year history of terrorist attacks by Palestinians. An <LOCATION> Arab-American </LOCATION> leader praised the statement. `` The addition of such a respected moral voice on the side of Palestinian independence is an historic development at a critical juncture in the <LOCATION> Palestinian-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict,'' said <PERSON> Abdeen </PERSON> <PERSON> Jabara </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American-Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anti-Discrimination </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` History will record that the moral authority of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> was indisputably on the side of peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>.'' The prelates cited Israeli responsibility in the beating deaths of Palestinians and people not involved in the uprising against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, the demolition of homes and arrest and detention without trial. They said the statement was devised after consultations with the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>, religious leaders in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policymakers and major Jewish, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> and Christian organizations. `` It is our conviction that a truly open moment for peace exists in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, and that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has an indispensable role to play in the peace process which has moved us to write this statement,'' said the committee. The nearly 2-year-old intefadeh, or <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising, is a cry for justice and personal and political identity that demands `` on both moral and political grounds, a response by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government,'' the prelates said. They stopped short of calling directly for the creation of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state. But they said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must go beyond the approach of the Camp David accords of the late 1970s, which gave Palestinians a secondary role in the peace process, and grant `` their right to participate as equals, through representatives selected by Palestinians, in all negotiations affecting their destiny.'' Having opened political discussions with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> in December 1988, `` the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> now has the opportunity to use its influence and relationships to foster a more extensive dialogue among <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> and the <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states,'' the prelates wrote. They also called for a `` clear, consistent'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy `` pressing Syrian withdrawal from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' They called on the Arab states and <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> to recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist, and asked the Arab nations to establish full diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` Anything short of this leaves the ` legitimacy' of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> undefined in the policy of the Arab states, and reinforces <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s position that the only road to survival is one requiring superior military power.

 Tens of thousands of Armenians fed up with the ethnic conflict that has deprived them of food and fuel massed Wednesday and called for creating self-defense units, activists said. `` We consider it pointless to count on <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> any longer,'' said <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Shakhbazyan </PERSON>, an Armenian independence activist who described the rally by telephone from the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> republic </LOCATION>'s capital of <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>. `` People called for a free, independent <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and there were appeals to the West and the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> for weapons support, because <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> is turning to open self-defense,'' Ms. <PERSON> Shakhbazyan </PERSON> said. The 19-month-old feud between Armenians and neighboring Azerbaijanis over control of the enclave of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> appeared to be only steps away from full-fledged civil war. <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> has put a stranglehold on the Armenian economy the past two months by blocking much of the rail traffic intended for <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, including food, fuel and building supplies for repairing areas ravaged by the earthquake that killed 25,000 people in December. The Soviet legislature ordered the blockade lifted last week, but a top transport official said Wednesday trains still were having trouble getting through <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. Railways Minister <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Konarev </PERSON> said Azerbaijani nationalists were `` still taking measures to prevent trains that carry food and fuel from getting through. They sit down and lie down on the tracks,'' and have women and children do the same, he said on Soviet television. <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> has a predominantly Christian Armenian population but was an enclave mostly of Moslem <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> until February, when growing tensions prompted <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to impose direct rule. The move failed to ease tensions, however. <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> is plagued with frequent armed clashes, widespread work stoppages, supply shortages and almost total blockage of its roads. Soviet troops have been stationed in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> to try to keep peace for the past year. Armenian speakers at Wednesday's rally said the troops ineffective and `` there was an appeal to creat self-defense units,'' said activist <PERSON> Mehat </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabrillian </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gabrillian </PERSON> said the meeting was called by 12 organizations that consider themselves a type of `` pre-parliament'' in preparation for <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s independence. In the lastest violence in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, firefighters shot at a crowd of attackers Tuesday night and critically wounded at least eight people, officials said. <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Arshenevsky </PERSON> said the cadets were riding in 19 vehicles and crossing a bridge into <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>, the enclave's capital, when a mob began throwing stones and firing on the passing column. He said the firefighters were forced to shoot in self-defense. However, representatives of the group that has led the campaign for the annexation of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> said the crowd was not violent. <PERSON> Ashot </PERSON> <PERSON> Manucharyan </PERSON>, an Armenian legislator from the region, said in a telephone interview from the headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> Karabakh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> that the civilians were attracted to the bridge by warning shots fired into the air by the cadets. He said one civilian was killed. Meanwhile, a Soviet government commission investigating the use of military force to put down a peaceful nationalist demonstration in the nearby republic of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> in April said the decision to send in the troops was made in the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>, according to Thursday editions of The Washington Post. The <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> has said local authorities made the decision to use troops and denied involvement. But the commission, appointed by <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s legislature, disputed this, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. In the resulting clash in the Armenian capital of <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>, 19 demonstrators were killed and hundreds injured by soldiers who dispersed them with sharpened shovels, clubs and poison gas. The commission said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> was in constant communication with <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders in the area and was involved in an operation that was `` of a punishing nature, having the appearance of a deliberately planned slaughter of innocent people carried out with extraordinary cruelty.'' `` The principal blame is with the republic,'' the report said, `` but at the same time responsibility lies with officials of the central organs of power.'' The report said the final decision to allow the use of troops was made by <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> Chebrikov </PERSON>, former head of the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Dimitri </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON>, the Soviet defense minister. It cast no direct blame on President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>.

 That extraterrestrial story from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> may have been cleared up _ those 12-foot, tiny-headed guys who landed in the <LOCATION> U.S.S.R. </LOCATION> were just trying to get back to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` Anything's possible,'' says <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Knell </PERSON>, a local UFO researcher who firmly believes there was an alien presence in a park in the borough of <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> seven months ago. `` Absolutely, there was some type of UFO in <LOCATION> Kissena </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Knell </PERSON>'s assertions _ he also said there may have been a return visit two weeks ago _ came two days after the Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported the presence of ETs in the town of <LOCATION> Voronezh </LOCATION>. Since then, scientists have disparaged the report, attributing it to rising sensationalism in the Soviet press under `` glasnost,'' or greater openness. Neither story seemed to impress local residents, who were more concerned with <PERSON> Knell </PERSON>'s presence in the park than any report of visiting ETs. `` This is my haunt. I've been coming to this park for years, and there's nothing going on here,'' said <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, shaking her head and laughing. `` They say that tree there was burned by a UFO _ it was broken by kids swinging on the branches.'' Sure enough, <PERSON> Knell </PERSON> did offer the damaged willow as evidence that something had beamed down there. But he also offered a mineralogist's report that a burned oval on the ground contained particles of a type of feldspar quartz found on the island of <LOCATION> Aruba </LOCATION>, not in <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>. `` We find this amazing,'' said <PERSON> Knell </PERSON>, who was joined by several other believers in UFOs. According to <PERSON> Knell </PERSON>, five people riding a bus on March 9 saw `` very bright lights'' hovering near a lake in the park. Since the park is located between <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> airports, they initially thought it was a downed aircraft, said <PERSON> Knell </PERSON>. Based on their accounts and other evidence, <PERSON> Knell </PERSON> said, UFO investigators determined this was a legitimate sighting. <PERSON> Knell </PERSON> thinks he knows why the people who spotted something in <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> never saw aliens or spoke with them. `` I believe they have their own agenda, and at this time it does n't include communication,'' said <PERSON> Knell </PERSON>, who on Wednesday addressed several skeptical reporters at the site where the UFO allegedly burned the ground. Unfortunately, that's also the site where the remnants of a downed tree were piled, killing off all the grass underneath, said park maintenance man <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Mackey </PERSON>, 60. `` If there was a spot around here burned out, I woulda known about it,'' said <PERSON> Mackey </PERSON>, who spends three days a week in the park. `` It's a figment of somebody's imagination.'' Perhaps, but <PERSON> Knell </PERSON>'s not alone. Some residents of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> region say the Soviet description of a UFO is similar to a fast-moving metallic ball they spotted earlier this month <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Abide </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said he first saw the object about three or four months ago. He saw it again early Wednesday while on his way to work at <ORGANIZATION> Abide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aero </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flying </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> about five miles south of <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>. `` And it did n't come out of a bottle of vodka,'' he said, referring to some speculation about the Soviet witnesses. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimmel </PERSON>, a pilot, said he saw the object two days ago while flying to <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn </LOCATION>. He said it was round, metallic, kept changing colors and was moving 800 to 900 mph at 3,000 feet some distance off his left wingtip. `` There was no way it was a weather balloon because no balloon can travel that fast,'' he said.

 Readers of the 1990 <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Book </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> will have plenty to cluck about besides the world's largest rooster. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Steele </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Banff </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, says his rooster named <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> tipped the scales at a record 22 pounds, 1 ounce on July 4, 1989, but an 11-foot-high hairdo and a first-rate chin-balancing act are among the book's other tidbits. The book, which went on the market Wednesday, is `` exploding with the most astounding facts of nature, human endurance scientific achievement, entertainment, business and sports,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Sterling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. Take that beehive hairdo, for instance. Team Hairfax of <LOCATION> Fairfax </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, built it onto a wig. <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Villasenor </PERSON> walked around wearing it _ in public _ on July 29, 1989, `` without the wig tilting or falling,'' the book said.

And if you ca n't cope with all that excitement, go to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> _ the city most prolific in psychologists and psychiatrists, with `` one shrink per 328 heads.''

 Trinity Repertory Theater is counting its pennies, especially the ones that some patrons handed over for $ 24 tickets. But that's what theater officials expected when they told people to pay what they wanted. `` We got everything from a penny a ticket to $ 20 a ticket'' at Tuesday night's performance, spokeswoman <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Fortier </PERSON> said Wednesday. The only rule was that no one got in free. The audience of about 240 people for the performance of <PERSON> Maxim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorky </PERSON>'s `` Summerfolk'' ranged `` from students to elderly from the apartment up the street,'' <PERSON> Fortier </PERSON> said. The crowd was larger than expected for a weekday night preview performance in the 550-seat theater, she said.

The average cost to produce a play is $ 30 a seat, he said. `` There are no guarantees, but we do intend to do it again'' depending on whether outside subsidies can be found, <PERSON> Fortier </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s clean air bill is advancing through a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee that once was a graveyard for air pollution legislation, but the measure is saddled with a conflict between top administration officials. Wednesday was a day of political triumph and confusion for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> legislation, which was approved in modified form by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> environment subcommittee, 21-0. Except for an acid rain bill passed by the panel in 1986, the subcommittee has been deadlocked over clean air measures for a decade while its two most powerful members fought over automobile and utility emissions. This year, subcommittee Chairman <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, D-Calif., champion of strict controls on autos and industry, and Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mich </LOCATION>., a friend of the auto industry, reached an historic agreement on auto emissions that ensured action on the The bill intended to clear the skies of urban smog, acid rain and toxic chemicals by the end of the century moves on to the full <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> _ possibly stopping first at another subcommittee for a debate on acid rain. But just before the subcommittee vote Wednesday, the panel was thrown into confusion by conflicting, nearly simultaneous statements from administration officials on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan for some cars to run on cleaner burning fuels than gasoline. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> clean fuels language was weakened by a 12-10 vote, with the bill's chief sponsors and most panel Republicans supporting the change backed by the oil and auto industries. Rep. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Lent </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said White House Chief of Staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> expressed the administration's neutrality on the clean fuels amendment, which eliminated <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s requirement that automakers build a million cars a year to run on alternative fuels. Lent and <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, the chief co-sponsors, backed the change which environmentalists said would weaken the legislation. But <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON> said he, too, was called about the same time by <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>. According to <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> urged rejection of the amendment. `` I do n't know where the administration is and it may be all over the lot ... on both sides,'' <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON> said. `` It tells a lot about how they're handling the bill.'' A White House spokesman, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, said after the vote, `` We support the president's proposals on alternative fuels.'' He said <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> told Lent the administration wanted something close to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s language, and suggested changes in the amendment to that end. Lent never mentioned such changes during debate. The bill that passed the subcommittee considerably toughened <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s original auto emissions standards, thanks to the Oct. 3 <ORGANIZATION> Waxman-Dingell </ORGANIZATION> agreement to adopt nationwide <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s toughest-in-the-country auto tailpipe requirements But panel members all agreed that there will be more harsh words and vigorous debates as the bill advances through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. There is disagreement over sharing the cost of acid rain reduction, a dispute over permitting expansion of coal burning utilities and argument over the severity of controls on chemical plants. Plus, the clean fuels issue is certain to surface again. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposal would have required auto companies to build 1 million clean-fuel cars a year from 1997 through 2004 in the nation's smoggiest cities. The new language, introduced by Reps. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Fields </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, would only require auto companies to certify they could build the cars, but the government would not order them built. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Sykes </PERSON>, a lobbyist for <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>, said the carmakers did n't like <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s language because there was no guarantee consumers would buy the alternative-fuel vehicles. The amendment also would define clean fuels as anything that achieves the same pollution reductions as a mixture of 85 percent methanol and 15 percent gasoline. The oil industry contended the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plan would give the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> strong authority to choose a fuel and that the agency favored methanol. The oil industry argued that every clean-burning fuel should have an equal chance to power <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s future cars.

<HEAD>Poor Hurt Most as Fear of Lawsuits Drives Away Doctors, Study Finds</HEAD>

 A fear of being sued is causing doctors to stop delivering babies, leaving impoverished women with poor obstetrical care and contributing to an increase in infant mortality, the Institute of Medicine says. `` Significant numbers'' of obstetricians, family physicians and nurse-midwives now are limiting their practices because of frequent malpractice lawsuits and sharply increasing insurance premiums, the institute study committee reported Wednesday. `` The fear of being sued has caused many doctors and midwives to limit care especially for women with high-risk pregnancies,'' said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bulger </PERSON>, chairman of the committee and president of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION>. `` In urban areas, this often means that low-income women have been hurt the most by the lack of providers,'' he said, but noted that there is a `` serious shortage of obstetrical care'' in both rural and inner areas. He said health providers tend to avoid patients with high-risk pregnancies. These most often are the impoverished because they generally are more likely to smoke and have poor diets, both of which increase the risks of having an imperfect child. One result, he said, is that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ranks 19th in the world in infant mortality and, by some measures, the statistics f infant death are getting worse. `` In 1985, infant mortality for blacks and other non-whites actually increased for the first time in 20 years,'' said <PERSON> Bulger </PERSON>. `` While the causes for this increase are many, the inaccessibility of care for poor women, a situation clearly made worse by liability concerns, is an important factor.'' The committee, which includes doctors, lawyers and educators, suggested both short-term and long-term solutions. Immediate actions recommended were: _ State subsidies for medical liability premiums for obstetrical providers who treat women on Medicaid _ Reviving the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> This would provide more loans for medical students who then would be obligated to serve in areas where physicians are in short supply. For more permanent solutions, the committee recommended: _ State experiments with alternatives to the system of medical liability Possible models could include a no-fault compensation system for certain conditions, such as neurological impairment of a newborn. Also suggested were negotiated contracts between doctor and patient, and establishing in advance a system of binding arbitration to settle disputes. _ Consideration of a plan by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> that calls for an administrative processing of claims that would determine fault, fix awards and discipline offenders The committee found that legal claims against obstetricians run two to three times higher than for other medical specialties, and that juries are twice as likely to find for the plaintiff in cases where an obstetrician is the defendant. `` It is easy to understand this situation, since most cases involve brain-damaged infants whose parents generally are without the resources to provide for a lifetime of complex health care,'' <PERSON> Bulger </PERSON> said. Malpractice insurance premiums for obstetrics in some cities now exceed $ 100,000 a year _ and sometimes the pro-rated cost per delivery is higher than the Medicaid reimbursement for a normal delivery, the committee found. Members of the committee said they found a number of misperceptions on the part of both patients and baby doctors. Dr. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbst </PERSON>, chairman of the department of obstetrics at the <ORGANIZATION> Pritzker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>, said many doctors mistakenly believe poor families are more apt to sue if there is a poor result from childbirth. Another misperception, said Dr. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Medearis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, professor of pediatrics at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, is that obstetricians are to blame for all of the mental retardation problems that occur in newborns. `` We do n't know what causes most mental retardation,'' he said. The committee said the number of obstetrical care providers in rural areas has fallen by 20 percent over the last five years. In some states, said <PERSON> Bulger </PERSON>, there are whole counties where there is no obstetrical care available. Doctors' fear of liability is also contributing to an increase in the number of babies delivered by cesarean section, <PERSON> Herbst </PERSON> said. The committee said that 20 years ago, only one in 20 babies was delivered by the surgical procedure, but the rate in some areas now is one in four babies. The Institute of Medicine is chartered by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>. It is a private organization that acts as an advisor to the federal government and initiates research of its own.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is asking <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> to investigate allegations that an Italian company violated Western export control rules and sold the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> computer equipment used to manufacture a highly sophisticated jetfighter. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> case regarding the Italian <ORGANIZATION> Olivetti </ORGANIZATION> company, which officials say is based on intelligence information, was brought up Wednesday at a White House meeting between President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Italian President <PERSON> Francesco </PERSON> <PERSON> Cossiga </PERSON>. `` The President did mention the concern about the Olivetti case. And President <PERSON> Cossiga </PERSON> stressed that this was being pursued in ... a highly cooperative manner,'' said Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Seitz </PERSON>, briefing reporters about <PERSON> Cossiga </PERSON>'s talks with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> notified <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> earlier this month that <PERSON> Olivetti </PERSON>, one of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s largest computer companies, was suspected of violating rules set by the 17-nation <ORGANIZATION> Coordinating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Multilateral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Export </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Controls </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> COCOM </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, said <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Gianni </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelis </PERSON>. He said <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> was investigating the information and would inform the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of the results at a meeting Oct. 22 in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Reginald </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartholomew </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for science and technology. In <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, Premier <PERSON> Giulio </PERSON> <PERSON> Andreotti </PERSON> met for about an hour Wednesday with <ORGANIZATION> Olivetti </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON>. Neither made any statements at the end of the meeting, although <ORGANIZATION> Olivetti </ORGANIZATION> has issued a statement denying any violation of <ORGANIZATION> COCOM </ORGANIZATION> rules and contending the products in question were shipped to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> COCOM </ORGANIZATION> authorization. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Italian officials have refused to publicly discuss details of the case, which involves one of the most powerful companies in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and sensitive intelligence information about Soviet weaponry. But an American official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Olivetti </PERSON> was suspected of selling the Soviets machine tools and computer software which were used to manufacture components for the YAK-41 supersonic jetfighter. The highly sophisticated plane is capable of taking off vertically. Another official said the sales had been going on for several years, and involved `` less than $ 50 million.'' Members of <ORGANIZATION> COCOM </ORGANIZATION>, which regulates the sale of high-technology to communist countries, have differed in recent years regarding sales of so-called `` dual use'' technology, which can be converted to manufacture weapons. The most famous case of such a <ORGANIZATION> COCOM </ORGANIZATION> rule violation involved the sale of computerized milling equipment by the Japanese <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> electronics firm and the Norwegian state-owned <ORGANIZATION> Kongsberg </ORGANIZATION> conglomerate to the Soviets. The equipment was used by the Soviets to make silent propellers for submarines, making them harder for the West to detect. As a result, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed legislation last year empowering the administration to impose sanctions, including import bans, against companies found in violation of <ORGANIZATION> COCOM </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelis </PERSON> sought to play down the <ORGANIZATION> Olivetti </ORGANIZATION> case, saying he had only discussed the matter for `` 25 seconds'' with <PERSON> Bartholomew </PERSON> Wednesday. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelis </PERSON> stressed that the main thrust of the Cossiga talks with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was prospects for peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, the upcoming elections in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and, above all, the reforms in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Seitz </PERSON> told reporters <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cossiga </PERSON> `` waxed philosophical about East-West issues and the importance of defense throughout this period of change in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` stressed how in these times of transition and uncertainty and, in some instances, unrest, that the hope not precede the deed and that the importance of a strong defense, a continuing defense, a steady approach, a long-term approach can not be understated.'' Later at a state dinner <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> hosted in <PERSON> Cossiga </PERSON>'s honor at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the American president lauded the friendship between <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, saying the ties have `` never been stronger.''

 Looking for a different worship experience? Consider `` Our Lady of <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>,'' a local Methodist church where you can drive in for gasoline and a lube job, then walk upstairs for some fire and brimstone. And if you do n't think God is watching, be forewarned that <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> spooks might be peering down from their shuttered office windows next door. For 17 years, the white steeple of <ORGANIZATION> Arlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> has towered over a busy intersection in the heart of this high-rise hotel and office building suburb just across the <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Thousands of neighboring office workers have given the Arlington Temple its irreverent nickname because of the red, white and blue <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> signs that beckon motorists to the gas pumps on the open-air ground floor beneath the church. As far as anyone knows, <ORGANIZATION> Arlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> is the only combination church and filling station in the country, the result of a deal between a local businessman and a minister searching for a place to house his congregation. In the early 1960s, when developers began razing <LOCATION> Rosslyn </LOCATION>'s taverns, pawn shops and decaying homes, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ames </PERSON> decided to build a hotel on part of his lumber yard and donate another parcel for a church in his father's memory But first, <PERSON> Ames </PERSON> had to relocate a gas station sitting on a corner of his property. Along came the Rev. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, whose flock had been worshiping in hotels, a school and a carpenter's shop. The pastor wanted to build a `` church of the marketplace in the concrete jungle of <LOCATION> Rosslyn </LOCATION>,'' a place where `` bishop or bum, rich or pauper, influential or nameless'' could find a spiritual home. Under their deal, <PERSON> Ames </PERSON> donated the land for the new church, and <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> agreed to rent the ground floorto the gas station. Arlington Temple was completed in 1972 at a cost of $ 750,000. The mortgage was paid off last year, thanks partly to the $ 18,000 in annual rent from Exxon. Today, the Rev. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> and station operator <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamblett </PERSON> are close pals and partners of sorts, as <PERSON> Hamblett </PERSON> puts a tiger in his customers' tanks and <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> pumps his message of salvation for the soul. The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> recruiting office in the 12-story building next door keeps its business to itself. During the gasoline crunch in the 1970s, <PERSON> Hamblett </PERSON> opened his station for an hour after Sunday services so elderly parishioners could fill up without waiting in long lines. <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> exchanged his black robes for a pair of overalls to help <PERSON> Hamblett </PERSON> pump gas. <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> says he can always borrow a few dollars from <PERSON> Hamblett </PERSON> to help a family in distress, and <PERSON> Hamblett </PERSON> volunteers as <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> for church Christmas festivities. After years of standing at the church's rear door, observing Sunday services in grease-stained denims, <PERSON> Hamblett </PERSON> recently became a formal member of <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Temple </LOCATION> with his family. `` <PERSON> Jack </PERSON>'s a really great guy,'' <PERSON> Hamblett </PERSON> says. `` I would n't be in business without him.'' <PERSON> Hamblett </PERSON> explains that some of his customers have gotten nasty since the Exxon oil spill in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. They've spit in his face and threatened to pour motor oil in his fish tank. `` I can go upstairs and talk to <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> for five minutes and feel all is right with the world again,'' he said. <PERSON> Hamblett </PERSON> unwittingly provided the sound effects for a Saturday wedding ceremony that <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> conducted a few years ago. Just as <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> uttered the words, `` Let them speak now or forever hold their peace,'' <PERSON> Hamblett </PERSON> revved his drag racing car's 3,000-horsepower engine in the garage below A deafening roar filled the sanctuary, penetrating 18-inch walls and floors of reinforced steel and concrete that are designed to shut out noise. `` It actually vibrated the whole building,'' <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> recalled. `` The groom sort of went into mild shock. I sent a minister friend downstairs to tell <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> to turn it off, and told the congregation ` that was not an objection.''' <PERSON> Hamblett </PERSON> says he learned his lesson. `` If I hear organ music, I try to keep the noise down,'' he says.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has more than 20 million Hispanic residents, the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> reports, meaning only five other countries have larger Latin American populations. `` This is our first estimate of over 20 million,'' <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinal </PERSON>, chief of the Ethnic and Hispanic Statistics Branch at the bureau, said Wednesday. `` It's up from about 14.5 million in 1980.'' <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> has the largest Latin American population at more than 147 million people. The only other countries in this hemisphere with more Hispanics than the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are: <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> with 86.7 million; <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, 31.9 million; <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, 31.2 million and <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, 21.4 million. The new Census analysis showed that as of last March Hispanics constituted 8.2 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population and are the fastest growing large population group. The bureau said immigration accounted for about half the growth. About two-thirds of the Hispanics in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> live in just three states. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> leads with 34 percent, followed by <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> at 21 percent and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with 10 percent. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> has 8 percent of the nation's Hispanics, and there are significant populations in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, the bureau reported. Estimates are not prepared for every state because `` Hispanics are not well spread out throughout the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> Del </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pinal </ORGANIZATION> said. The Census report estimated the total Hispanic population of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at 20,076,000 as of March, up from 19,431,000 a year earlier. The largest segment is Mexicans at 12,567,000, followed by people of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> origin, 2,545,000, Puerto Ricans, 2,328,000, and Cubans, 1,068,000. The balance were of Spanish or other Hispanic origin. Mexicans were mostly concentrated in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the report said. Cubans are mostly in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, while Puerto Ricans tend to live in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and Central and South Americans are largely in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. While Mexicans were the largest group they are not the fastest growing, the report said. Comparing the estimates for 1982 and 1989, the bureau said Central and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> had increased by 67 percent. The `` other Hispanic'' category rose 31 percent, followed by Mexicans, up 30 percent, Puerto Ricans, 14 percent and Cubans, 12 percent.

 Three sisters got an unexpected delivery from the pizza man who had accidentally ran over the family dog: a fluffy, white puppy to help make up for the loss. `` I was in tears,'' said the girls' mother, <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendyk </PERSON>. `` I could n't believe he did something like that. It restored my faith in young people.'' <PERSON> Brett </PERSON> <PERSON> Croner </PERSON>, 20, accidently killed the first dog during a Saturday night run for Pizza Hut. <PERSON> Croner </PERSON> said he knew how the girls felt because his own dog was killed by a car last spring. `` To lose one is to lose a part of yourself,'' he said. Mrs. <PERSON> Mendyk </PERSON> said her daughters, <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON>, 8, <PERSON> Sara </PERSON>, 9, and <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON>, 12, were all smiles when <PERSON> Croner </PERSON> brought the new dog Sunday afternoon.

Still, <PERSON> Croner </PERSON> said he was determined to help ease the girls' pain After looking at about eight or nine different pups, he found a mixed-breed, female dog that looked like <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON>. He left the puppy at the door of the Mendyks' house with a note that read, `` Please accept this puppy as my apology.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Mendyk </PERSON> said the girls have named the 6-week-old dog <PERSON> Brett </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Arab Arms Deal Moves Ahead</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A $ 3 billion <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms purchase by <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> faces little apparent opposition from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s supporters on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration on Wednesday informally notified <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of the intended sale. That touched off a 50-day period in which <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> either kills the deal by majority votes in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> or lets it go through. The key items are 315 modern tanks, but two-thirds of the price tag _ which is equivalent to a year's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> _ is the cost of equipment and ammunition, including huge trucks to transport any tanks that break down. Rep. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., said more than two dozen members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had written to Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> requesting `` additional consultation. But before notifying <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of the plan, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and other administration officials held several sessions designed to gauge congressional sentiment. `` We intend to have a full hearing,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. Yet, the congressman added in an interview: `` I do n't think anyone is inclined yet to file a resolution of disapproval. We want to be sure these tanks are not used by anyone else in the region.'' Political maneuvering in recent weeks managed to diffuse the concerns that customarily touch off strong opposition on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> deals with <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> countries technically at war with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The Saudis would receive the M1A2 tanks beginning in the middle of the 1990s, at about the same time the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> would field them. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has a comparable tank, the Merkava. To smooth congressional approval, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration agreed not to equip the Saudi tanks with plates of uranium armor, a much denser metal than steel. It was not immediately clear where the tanks would be based. If some are deployed at the <ORGANIZATION> Tabuk </ORGANIZATION> military base the tanks would be only 120 miles from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Others may be based near <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, and still others at an armored training school near <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>. In a separate deal, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is to receive $ 100 million in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> payments for the pre-positioning of American military equipment. The arms presumably would be used in the event of a <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> war that threatened <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> security. Next year, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> is expected to try to purchase American jet fighter planes. The purchase of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tanks to replace 15-year-old and largely inoperable French tanks is considered a warm-up test of congressional sentiment. Asked why <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s supporters had not launched a fight against the sale, a local military expert said the administration consulted in advance with members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and `` an effort is under way to avoid a confrontation.'' `` Besides, the tanks are a ground system, having a marginal effect on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s security,'' said the non-governmental expert, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Administration officials have stressed in recent weeks the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commitment to make sure <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> maintains a qualitative edge over Arab armed forces. The Saudi tanks will be equipped with special viewers for the commanders and with night-fighting capability. Also, they will have no electronics. `` It is the most advanced version of the tank that has been put out to date,'' the expert said. Last year, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration signed a deal with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> for the manufacture of 555 tanks for the Egyptian army. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> declined to discuss the purchase except to say <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had been informally notified of the administration's intention. The purchase was designed initially as a goodwill gesture for a visit by King Fahd. But twice this summer the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> monarch canceled trips to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with the explanation his government was engaged in trying to arrange a cease-fire in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> between warring Christian and Moslem factions. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> over the years has turned back several <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms sales to <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> countries out of concern for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s security.

 Four out of five Americans know why <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> has been in the news lately, but only about one in 10 can identify <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> or Barney Frank without help, according to a news industry survey. The survey, released Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; the Press, showed that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> news gets a low rating when people are asked what stories they are following very closely. Stories about <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> congressman from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> who has admitted having sex with a male prostitute and then hiring him as a personal aide and driver, were followed by only 6 percent of those surveyed. This made the <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> affair one of the lowest-interest stories since the surveys began in 1986, equaled only by the influence-peddling scandal that drove former Japanese Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> from office in May. Only 12 percent of the 1,234 adults interviewed by telephone correctly identified <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>. Ten percent knew that <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> was the former housing secretary whose administration of rental subsidy programs for the poor is under investigation by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. But 80 percent knew that Ms. <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> was tried in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, on charges of slapping a policeman. The survey was conducted Oct. 5-8, a week after the actress was convicted. The most closely followed story in the survey was Hurricane Hugo, with 60 percent saying they kept up with developments closely. This made it the third-ranking story in public interest since the surveys began, exceeded only by the 1986 Challenger space craft explosion at 80 percent and the rescue of young <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> from a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> well in 1987, which 69 percent said they kept up on. <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> said in a news release that the difference in public response to the <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> stories `` is in keeping with a pattern that has become clear from the monthly findings of the Times Mirror News Interest Index. Public attentiveness to coverage of news events is high, while public attentiveness to news about most personal scandals is usually low.'' Times Mirror also said its October findings `` dramatically reinforced'' previous indications that news from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, even when it has far-reaching consequences, often gets little attention. No major <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> story in the latest survey was followed closely by as many as 25 percent of Americans. The most closely followed <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> story in the history of the surveys was the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision in July upholding a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> law against burning the American flag. It was followed closely by 51 percent of those surveyed. Overseas stories often get a low rating also. The elevation of the once-outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> to a role in governing <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, for instance, was followed closely by only 12 percent of those surveyed in July. In the latest count even interest in overseas events, such as the flight of East German refugees to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> at 31 percent and the failed coup attempt in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> at 29 percent, outdrew <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> stories. Only 19 percent paid close attention to attempts in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to repeal the new catastrophic illness insurance plan. Among persons over age 50, this rose to 36. House approval of a cut in the capital gains tax drew close attention from 14 percent. Among people with family incomes of $ 50,000 or more, this increased to 26 percent. The study was conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; the Press, a division of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, which publishes the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Times, <ORGANIZATION> Newsday </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> Courant and other newspapers and owns broadcast stations. The center said the study was subject to a 3 percent sampling error.

 A year ago Saturday, members of a religious group brought the body of an 8-year-old girl to a rural fire station. The death of <PERSON> Dayna </PERSON> <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON> set off a child abuse investigation that is far from over. The next night, 53 <ORGANIZATION> Ecclesia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> children were taken into state custody. Today, 40 remain in foster homes because their parents wo n't agree to conditions set by the state Children's Services Division `` I think this is the only time in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that so many children have been taken into care on such a crisis basis under such horrible circumstances,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, the agency administrator. Parents of the children live at a farmhouse near <LOCATION> Sandy </LOCATION>, east of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, where the youngsters were rounded up by state officials 12 months ago. State officials want the adults to admit their children were victims of abuse and to promise that they wo n't be abused again. `` We're still working with their parents,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. `` We would like very much to make the kind of commitment that we in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> need to hear so their children can be safe.'' One parent they have n't worked with is <PERSON> Dayna </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Eldridge </PERSON> <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the founder of <LOCATION> Ecclesia </LOCATION>. State officials believe he is in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, but his whereabouts could not be determined this week. A telephone call to Ecclesia officials for comment was not returned. On Wednesday, the state officials held a news conference at the juvenile detention center where the children were taken on Oct. 14, 1988. `` Why we are here today is to remember <PERSON> Dayna </PERSON> <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON> and ... to remember that <PERSON> Dayna </PERSON> did not die accidentally. <PERSON> Dayna </PERSON> was brutally, ceaselessly, needlessly beaten to death,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. Four adult Ecclesia members were convicted of manslaughter. A fifth member was convicted of criminal mistreatment in connection with other beatings of children. Several children testified at the trial that they were systematically beaten as part of the group's tough discipline. They said that <PERSON> Dayna </PERSON> was beaten with an electrical cord, rubber hose, piece of plastic pipe and weightlifting belt as the other children were forced to watch and count the blows. <PERSON> Eldridge </PERSON> <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> appeared on the `` <PERSON> Oprah </PERSON> <PERSON> Winfrey </PERSON> Show'' after the arrests of Ecclesia members and blamed the media's negative publicity about the group for his daughter's death <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON>, a former college basketball player, founded <ORGANIZATION> Ecclesia </ORGANIZATION> in 1975 at the <ORGANIZATION> Watts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to steer children away from drugs and crime. He motivated them through discipline and athletics, saying once he wanted to prepare them to compete in the Olympics. The group came to <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> in the summer of 1987 and announced plans to cultivate crops and train children for athletic competition. Since the manslaughter convictions of his associates, <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON>, who was not charged, has kept a low profile. `` He's not had any contact with the caseworker for his family. He has n't had any contact with me. He has n't appeared in court hearings. He has n't been involved in any of the meetings or contacts that we've had,'' said <PERSON> Bart </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Clackamas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> branch manager for the children's services agency. <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON>'s four surviving children are in state custody. He has n't seen them; his wife has, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. The state has spent $ 545,000 on the case as of July, and continues to spend about $ 10,000 per month for foster care. Of the 53 children taken by the state, two were returned to the custody of their parents, while 11 others remain under state jurisdiction but live with relatives. The 40 in foster homes are impatient to reunite with their parents. `` A year to you and I is 10 years to a kid,'' said caseworker <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Huntley </PERSON>. `` No one can tell them what will happen tomorrow and that's really difficult for them.''

 Panamanian officers who led last week's abortive coup were recruited and paid more than $ 1 million by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> charged in an interview The Panamanian leader also alleged that <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> businessmen and Nicaraguan Contras served as messengers for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, relaying messages between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the plotters, the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in Thursday's editions. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was involved before, during and after the coup,'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said. `` They had to make the contacts, woo them, convince them. It's a lot of work before you've hooked the fish. But they were the hook and the useful fools were the fish.'' `` The Contras put them the coup plotters in contact with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said that an investigation following the uprising revealed the existence of a bank account in the name of Capt. <PERSON> Erick </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murillo </PERSON>, one of the alleged coup leaders, containing more than $ 1 million. `` There was a lot of money there for a normal Panamanian. Six zeroes. It was a million-dollar account,'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said. He charged that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials gave <PERSON> Murillo </PERSON> the money for bribes, but would not identify the bank that held the account. <PERSON> Murillo </PERSON>, a member of the elite Battalion 2000, was one of 10 officers the Panamanian government said was killed during the coup attempt. While government reports have said 37 soldiers were detained following the attempt, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said 77 have been. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> also said that one of the detained rebels had $ 700,000 in cash that he had been using to bribe the troops.

 Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> changed the rules of the barracks when he snuffed out the second military attempt to topple him in 18 months. Now it's kill or be killed. `` I think the law of the jungle is now the rule within the military,'' opposition leader <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> said in an interview. When rebellious officers tried to overthrow <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in March 1988, the coup attempt was played by the old rules of <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> power struggles. It was bloodless. But the Oct. 3 barracks uprising, which showed <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s hold on power was more precarious than previously thought, may have ended with the summary execution of several mutineers. Top members of his general staff were arrested, and their whereabouts or condition is unknown. `` In military life, he who takes up arms in rebellion has his answer in arms, too,'' Col. <PERSON> Arnulfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Castrejon </PERSON>, a member of the general staff, said Wednesday. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is accused of personally shooting the coup leader, Maj. <PERSON> Moises </PERSON> <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON>, who was credited with putting down the March 1988 revolt. The Defense Forces say <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON> was killed by an artillery blast. However, the family said three bullet wounds were found in his body. At least seven other officers and two sergeants also died, possibly after surrendering. Capt. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Tejada </PERSON> was shot once in the right temple, his mother said. Another officer, Capt. <PERSON> Nicasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, died in custody several days after the uprising. The Defense Forces has offered no explanation for what the coroner called `` death by asphyxiation.'' Neither the whereabouts or condition of 36 other rebel soldiers on the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> list of detainees is known. `` I am afraid other prisoners are dead,'' Roman Catholic Rev. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Guardia </PERSON> said as he prepared to say a funeral Mass for <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> earlier this week. President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> on Tuesday accused the Defense Forces of murder and called for <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to take strong action against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The rebels stopped short of killing <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> when he was a hostage; <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say the rebels would n't even agree to turn <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> over to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for prosecution on drug charges. Instead, <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON> and his men surrendered. The Oct. 3 rebels hesitated and died for it. Now that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has rewritten the rules, few expect to see the mistake repeated. `` I think he's bringing upon himself greater opposition and more violent opposition,'' <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is much weaker because he has brought violence and death into the center of his power.'' <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> has lived with military strongmen for 21 years but even the 1968 coup in which the late Gen. <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON> took power was bloodless. The country had not experienced the kind of political-military violence that has traumatized neighbors such as <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Until now. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, a Torrijos protege without the <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON> charisma, has become increasingly volatile since his February 1988 indictment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug-trafficking charges. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> denies guilt. Once admired for the sheer force of his personality, the general now commands through fear. `` He is a beast,'' one coup participant said after reaching the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` He has established a new rule of the game,'' said <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON>. `` Kill or be killed.'' The Oct. 3 uprising not only exposed deep discontent at the highest levels of the 15,000-person <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, its bloody ending also left <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> isolated. Three members of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s general staff, including the head of military intelligence, were among those arrested after the mutiny. Key units, such as the one responsible for security at Defense Forces headquarters, were involved. Three colonels, two majors, three captains and nineteen lieutenants are on the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> list of detainees and another captain and 41 other people fled to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after the coup failed. The revolt has sparked the largest shuffling of commanders in Defense Forces history. The internal purges leave <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> with an officer corps stripped of many of its most professional leaders, sources say. The Defense Forces denies <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> personally killed any mutineers. They say all the victims died during the fighting. At the same time, some clear, even clumsy, messages are being sent. Several days after the uprising, the pro-Noriega newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Critica </ORGANIZATION> ran a story about a 1987 coup attempt in distant <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Leone </LOCATION> on its front page under a thick red headline. `` Six People Executed For a Coup Attempt,'' it said.

<TEXT>
 Former President <PERSON> Leopoldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Galtieri </PERSON>, who led <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> into the 1982 Falklands War and was imprisoned for negligence in its defeat, has been freed by presidential pardon. <PERSON> Galtieri </PERSON> said nothing to reporters on his release Wednesday from Campo de Mayo army base on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Galtieri </PERSON>, 63, was one of 39 retired generals and admirals pardoned Saturday by President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> along with dozens of people accused of being leftist terrorists and 174 soldiers who rebelled against the former government. <PERSON> Galtieri </PERSON>'s pardon also voids pending charges against him in civilian court of human rights abuses. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>, who took office July 8, said the pardon was needed `` to close and stitch the wounds'' of the past so the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> country of 32 million people might concentrate on its economic problems. He said a second pardon is pending that will free <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Firmenich </PERSON>, co-founder of the Montonero urban guerrillas, and six officers convicted of kidnap, torture and murder during the military dictatorship's 1976-83 crackdown on leftist subversion. The officers include <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Videla </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Viola </PERSON>, both former presidents and former army commanders-in-chief. <PERSON> Galtieri </PERSON> was president from December 1981 to June 1982. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> convicted him of negligence in May 1986 for his handling of the 74-day Falklands War against <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> lost _ a loss that led to the end of the military junta and 1983 election of a civilian goverment. <PERSON> Galtieri </PERSON> began the war on April 2, 1982, to recover the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> islands held by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and claimed by <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> since the early 19th century. The military's highest tribunal ruled that he did not anticipate or prepare for a British counterattack, nor was <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s defense of the islands properly coordinated. <PERSON> Galtieri </PERSON> also had faced federal court charges in the shooting deaths of 13 political prisoners in December 1976, nine months after President <PERSON> Isabel </PERSON> <PERSON> Peron </PERSON> was ousted in a coup and the new military regime stepped up its crackdown on subversion. Rights groups oppose <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>'s pardon and plan to challenge its constitutionality in court. The <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, major newspapers, two of the three largest political parties, and influential business and farm organizations endorsed the pardon and indicated they would support its extension to <PERSON> Videla </PERSON>, <PERSON> Viola </PERSON> and <PERSON> Firmenich </PERSON>. At least 8,960 purported leftists were arrested and never seen again _ presumed executed _ during the `` dirty war'' against subversion, a presidential commission found. Some rights groups put the total closer to 30,000. The armed forces insists it quelled an armed insurrection by using the same tactics as guerrillas.

<HEAD>Study Critical of Surgery for Small Abdominal Aneurysms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Large bulges in the main blood vessel in the abdomen should be repaired because they are likely to burst, but most small ones do not require routine surgery, a study published today concludes. These balloon-like bulges, known as abdominal aortic aneurysms, are being increasingly spotted as people undergo ultrasound tests to check for other problems, such as gallstones and cancer. About 40,000 Americans have surgery to repair these aneurysms each year, but some doubt lingers about whether smaller aneuryisms can be safely ignored. When the aneurysms break, massive bleeding may result, and about half of all such victims die. The latest study, conducted at the <ORGANIZATION> Mayo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION>, found that most abdominal aortic aneurysms expand slowly, and small ones pose little risk of rupture. `` Our data indicate that all small aneurysms do not need to be routinely repaired,'' said Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hallett </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, senior author of the study. `` Their repair should be individualized.'' He said that in some cases, repair of small aneurysms may be considered reasonable, such as when patients suffer painful symptoms or have other blood vessel disease. Overall, he estimated that surgery is appropriate for about one-third of patients with small abdominal aneurysms under 5 centimeters in size. For the rest, he recommended that doctors follow patients with exams every three to six months. The latest study, based on a survey 370 aneurysm patients in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, was published in the New England Journal of Medicine. <PERSON> Hallett </PERSON> said some surgeons recommend fixing all aneurysms because of the belief that they will eventually expand and rupture. However, several vascular surgeons said they are very selective and limit routine surgery to patients with aneurysms larger than 4 or 5 centimeters. `` I do n't think anybody has evidence that aneurysm surgery is overused,'' said Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. `` I do exactly as they say. I am quite aggressive with aneurysms over 5 centimeters and very selective on something that's smaller I do n't think this will blow the medical profession away.'' In an accompanying editorial in the journal, Dr. <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Baylor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> recommended surgery for aneurysms larger than 4 centimeters. He questioned the selection and diagnosis of patients in the study and said he does not believe it accurately reflects the natural course of aneurysms. In the study, doctors concluded that the risk of rupture after eight years was 25 percent in people with aneurysms larger than 5 centimeters, 5 percent in those with aneurysms between 3.5 and 5 centimeters and zero in people with aneurysms smaller than 3.5 centimeters.

<HEAD>Tensions Mount Amid Talk Of Gang Offering Bounty On Police Officers'
Heads</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE DREYFOUS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police filed in for roll call as usual, but this day they were told the neighborhood stakes had gone up: A street gang had put a $ 1,000 bounty on their heads. It might just be talk, police spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said, but the talk's been persistent _ so much so that commanding officers felt they had to warn patrol units before they went out on the streets Tuesday evening. `` We happen to think a police officer's life is priceless, so we reject any street criminal trying to put some value on it,'' <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said Wednesday. Word of the <ORGANIZATION> Franklin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION> gang's bounty has spread quickly through the streets of the <LOCATION> Roxbury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mattapan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dorchester </LOCATION> sections, <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said, `` and people in the community feel a repugnance at the notion.'' But residents become equally alarmed when one of their own is shot under murky circumstances, which is what happened several hours after Tuesday's roll call. <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Carr </PERSON>, 30, was stopped for a search by two officers, one of whom opened fire when he mistook a set of keys for a gun. He was listed as stable Wednesday at <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. Deputy Superintendent <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Celester </PERSON> said the officer saw something shiny and `` feared for his life.'' Some residents see things differently. `` I'm just as concerned about criminal elements as anyone in the community,'' said <PERSON> Juanita </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> member and <LOCATION> Roxbury </LOCATION> resident. `` But it's a double-edged sword. `` You want to make sure that gang members participating in violent activity are stopped or removed from the streets, but you also want to make sure there's no abuse of that power.'' <PERSON> Carr </PERSON>'s cousin <PERSON> Marva </PERSON> <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> said Tuesday night's shooting was an example of abuse. She said <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> had perhaps become a victim of rumor. `` Maybe someone on the street said something about -LRB- a bounty -RRB-, but it's the first time I've heard of it,'' she said. `` I'm on the street every day. I hang on the street and I do n't know why I would n't have heard of this.'' Nonetheless, violence against police officers has increased: A motorcycle officer was the target of a group throwing stones the night <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> was shot, and at least three police cruisers have come under gunfire during the last 1 -LCB- weeks, <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said. `` We're putting -LRB- reports of a bounty -RRB- together with other things that have been taking place,'' he said. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Agee </PERSON>, assistant executive director at the <ORGANIZATION> Roxbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Multi-Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said he had n't noticed a huge increase in tension on the streets, `` but it may be that people have just begun to accept the tension.'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yancey </PERSON>, a city councilor who represents <LOCATION> Mattapan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dorchester </LOCATION>, said officers live with daily dangers and word of a bounty could heighten their fears to the peril of all. `` If they feel there are people out to kill them then they're going to act in a manner that would consider self-preservation first,'' <PERSON> Yancey </PERSON> said `` And if these rumors have no basis in fact, then a great disservice is being done not only to the police officers but to the community itself.''

<TEXT>
 Three weeks after Hurricane Hugo ripped ashore, this inland city remains a `` silent victim,'' so littered with downed magnolias and willow oaks that officials are urging parents to keep children at home on <LOCATION> Halloween </LOCATION>. `` From an airplane, it looks like a forest that got hit by a hurricane,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Steger </PERSON>, an assistant city manager who was in charge of emergency operations after <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> hit in the predawn hours of Sept. 22. Residents like to brag about <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>'s picturesque tree-lined streets. Hundred-foot-tall willow oaks form a canopy over residential areas surrounding the business district. Pine, magnolia and hickory trees also were popular. But <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s blast changed the landscape, sending trees crashing down through power lines and against homes, and leaving many streets blocked. Today, debris is piled so high that some houses are virtually hidden, and stumps the size of pickup trucks offer a formidible challenge. City officials, worried at the thought of trick-or-treaters strolling through the streets to avoid debris, want parents to keep their children at home on Halloween. `` I'm scared to death a kid is going to get killed,'' Mayor <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Myrick </PERSON> said. City arborist <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> McSween </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> lost only 1 or 2 percent of its trees, although in older, residential areas near the heart of the city, `` it was closer to 100 percent.'' The toll is likely to grow as damaged but still-standing trees begin to suffer. `` A lot of the trees have had their lives shortened as a result of the storm,'' <PERSON> McSween </PERSON> said. `` Many will die over the next few years from decay and disease.'' `` <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> was the silent victim,'' <PERSON> Steger </PERSON> said, referring to the national coverage of the devastation in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION> `` One certainly did n't expect a city 200 miles from the ocean to suffer this kind of damage.'' Unlike the <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> area, where the hurricane made landfall with 135 mph winds, hardly anyone in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> was left homeless. By the time <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s eye passed just west of downtown, it had been downgraded to a tropical storm with sustained winds of 70 mph and gusts up to 90 mph. Still, the storm has been blamed for three deaths and caused more than $ 300 million in damage in the <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> area. By the end of the month, contracts will be awarded to remove 200,000 truckloads of debris left by the storm _ enough to fill a 60-story skyscraper three or four times. City crews, which already have carted away 15,000 truckloads, have been instructed to stop so the federal government will pick up most of the $ 10 million cleanup tab. Officials say it will take until March to haul away all the debris. `` You ca n't walk on the sidewalk to catch the bus,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, who is waiting for estimates on damage to his house from four downed pines. His wife, <PERSON> Susan </PERSON>, was concerned about the safety of their two young children. `` You ca n't very well send them out to play,'' she said. `` They would have to ride their bikes in the middle of the road. That's too hazardous. The storm also disrupted political life, forcing the city to postpone its mayoral primary by two weeks. <PERSON> Myrick </PERSON> easily won Tuesday's <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> primary, but only about 7 -LCB- percent of registered voters turned out. Still, life is beginning to return to normal. As of Wednesday, only about 50 homes remained without power. That compares with the morning of the storm, when <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said nearly 100 percent of its 235,000 customers lost power. About one of every two homes remained dark for a week or more. Homeowners are concentrating on repairing broken roofs, porches and fences, although in some cases it takes a week or more just to get estimates. One fence company said it has received 900 calls. <ORGANIZATION> Allstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, anticipating 15,000 to 20,000 claims in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> alone, dispatched dozens of adjusters to the area. One family left a note of thanks on one of the few trees remaining on their yard. `` We thank all those: _ out-of-town power company workers. _ <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION>. _ city workers. _ phone company. _ paper carriers, letter carriers, police and fire departments.'' Scribbled on the note was a P.S. _ `` We're alive!''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s inspector general says the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> properly investigated allegations of homosexuality involving USS <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> sailors <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> during its criminal probe of the explosion on the battleship. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> did not malign the character of <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> or <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON>,'' Inspector General <PERSON> June </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said in a report released Wednesday. Ms. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> reviewed the investigation after allegations from <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>'s family that the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> mishandled their duties and leaked damaging allegations to the news media. But Ms. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> concluded that the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> conducted a thorough criminal probe of the April 19 explosion that killed 47 crewmen, including <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>. Her conclusions were sharply disputed by <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>, the attorney for <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON>, who called the report `` a perfect example of one branch of the government covering up and whitewashing another branch of the government. This whole <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> investigation has been one Watergate piled on top of another.'' <LOCATION> NIS </LOCATION> investigators were brought in to assist Rear Adm. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Milligan </PERSON> after suspicions of possible suicide or homicide arose. <PERSON> Milligan </PERSON> cited <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> as the most likely person to have caused the explosion, saying he apparently placed some type of detonator between gun powder bags. He concluded <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON>, who survived the blast in the lowest level of the gun turret, had no link to its cause. Ms. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> review found `` the <LOCATION> NIS </LOCATION> investigation was thorough, complete and expeditious,'' and that it was proper for special agents to investigate allegations of possible homosexuality in the case, even though no such activity was ever proven. <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>'s family has charged the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> with using the sailor as a scapegoat and has sought a congressional investigation into the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s report. <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kubicina </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>'s sister, said shortly after <PERSON> Milligan </PERSON>'s report was released that the family planned to file a defamation of character lawsuit against the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> for alleging <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> may have caused the explosion. <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> slurred his reputation and his lawyer has said the service apologized to him for leaking false information. But Ms. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> NIS </ORGANIZATION> agents `` did not apologize'' to <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON>. `` All logical investigative leads were covered, including those that required examining the backgrounds of persons closest to the explosion,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said, `` One good thing has come out of the inspector general's report. For the first time, an officer of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has admitted that <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> had nothing to do with the explosion.'' `` We're also going to file extensive lawsuits against those media outlets that initially carried the defamatory accusations that <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> was a homosexual involved in a murder-suicide plot.''

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is `` disturbed'' by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s continued nuclear program without outside safeguards but says that nation does not have a nuclear weapon, according to a congressional aide The president must make such a certification every year for <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> to continue receiving <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sent a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> saying continuation of aid would `` significantly reduce'' the chances of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> acquiring such a weapon, the legal formula he is required to use for aid to continue. But according to the aide's description of the letter, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he `` continued to be disturbed by the fact that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is continuing its unsafeguarded nuclear program.'' <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s nuclear program has posed the spectre of a nuclear arms race with neighboring <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> for years. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> exploded what it called a nuclear `` device'' in 1974, a device it insisted was not a weapon.

 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators will decide whether illegal aliens will be excluded from next year's census following the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s refusal to take up the issue on its own. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted Wednesday not to take up the measure, which has pitted <ORGANIZATION> Sunbelt </ORGANIZATION> states whose populations have been swollen by illegal aliens against <PERSON> Frostbelt </PERSON> states that stand to lose <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seats after the census. By a 232-184 vote, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> used a parliamentary maneuver steered by Rep. <PERSON> Silvio </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Conte </PERSON>, R-Mass., to keep the census measure off the floor That vote instructed <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> negotiators to accept a provision in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version of the State, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> and Commerce appropriations bill to condemn the continuation in power of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The rules permit only one set of instructions to a conference committee. The move blocked Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridge </PERSON>, R-Pa., from offering his own set of instructions on the census question to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members of the same committee Ridge's provisions would have ordered the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> negotiators to accept another Senate-passed provision, this one to barring the use of any money for the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> to count illegal aliens in its 1990 head count. The census bureau has always counted residents regardless of citizenship. Past efforts to exclude illegal aliens from the count have always died in committee. Under current census rules, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, with many illegal aliens, expect to gain House seats and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> are among those expected to lose seats. `` The question is simple,'' <PERSON> Ridge </PERSON> said. `` Are people who have entered our country illegally entitled to representation in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>? I say no.'' Even though it was apparent they would not have a chance to get a vote on the <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION> proposal, backers of the census change used the hour devoted to the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> censure to debate the census issue. Ridge and others characterized it as a matter of political fairness. `` I want equal representation for <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens,'' argued Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodling </PERSON>, R-Pa. Opponents argued that any change in census rules at this point would cost $ 1 billion, including the cost of reprinting forms and retraining the census-takers. They said it was not clear counters could even get accurate information on citizenship. Opponents have said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> provision is clearly unconstitutional, since the Constitution requires a census of `` persons.'' When the Constitution wants something to apply only to citizens, it clearly says `` citizens,'' according to this argument.

<HEAD>Dollar Up, Share Prices Plunge in Tokyo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar edged higher against the Japanese yen Thursday, while share prices dove on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The dollar closed at 144.60 yen, up 0.70 yen from Wednesday's 143.90-yen finish It opened at 144.25 yen, and moved between 143.70 yen and 144.65 yen. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues lost 444.73 points, or 1.26 percent, to 34,795.34. It was this year's second-largest one-day loss, following a 489.90-point decline June 15, dealers said Many stock players sold issues in fear of another discount rate increase, since Wednesday's increase seemed to have failed to support the yen, said <PERSON> Masaya </PERSON> <PERSON> Hashizume </PERSON>, a dealer with <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. `` The most discouraging factor was the dollar's strength despite the rate hike, not the hike itself,'' he said. Investors sold issues, such as constructions, that they had bought because of the yen's strength. The <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> raised its official discount rate, the key lending rate charged commercial banks, by 0.5 percent to 3.75 percent. The discount rate also affects other domestic interest rates, and discourages stock investment. <PERSON> Satoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sumita </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION>'s governor, told a news conference Wednesday the central bank made the hike in consideration of recent flucutuations in exchange markets, domestic economic trends, consumer prices and the money supply. In currency dealings, `` market players were still inclined to buy the dollar because of the <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> comment Tuesday, which had a much stronger impact on the market than the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION>'s discount rate hike,'' <PERSON> Minori </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeuchi </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> hinted to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet officials in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Tuesday that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> would not ease <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates in the near term regardless of the currency's movements. Citing the yen's weakness despite the discount rate hike, <PERSON> Takeuchi </PERSON> blamed the <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> comments for the worsening foreign exchange fluctuations. A trader with the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday, `` There is good demand for the dollar, though the market remains a bit nervous.'' Stock players were concerned whether the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> would lower its official interest rates based on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wholesale price index for September, which is due Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> trader said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Market analysts say a discount rate cut by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> central bank would be the best remedy to halt the dollar's excessive rise after a series of discount rate hikes in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, in addition to concerted central bank interventions. Interest rate reductions tend to weaken the value of a currency.

<HEAD>Coast Guard Needs Tighter Control Over Cruise Ships, Board Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> should tighten control over the safety of cruise ships that carry 7 million passengers a year, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> says. The board on Wednesday approved a series of recommendations for the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, cruise ship lines, operators of other passenger ships and states for improving the safety of small and large passenger vessels. Board member <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> said 264 people have died in passenger ship accidents in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the last 25 years. He acknowledged that is not many fatalities compared to the more than 1,000 annual deaths in small boating accidents. `` But the potential is there for a disaster that could double that figure in one incident,'' said <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>. Major foreign-flagged cruise vessels regularly carry hundreds of Americans out of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ports while remaining largely free of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> regulation, he said. The five-member board, which oversees safety for all modes of transportation, cited untrained crews that speak no English, a lack of life vests, inadequate safety equipment, unsafe ship designs and other problems on the foreign-flagged pleasure ships operating out of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ports. <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> said solving the problems could be costly for some ship operators but could save hundreds of lives. The panel also called for far more <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> vigilance over domestic passenger vessels and recommended that states also more closely regulate the safety of boats operating on their waterways. The recommendations were accompanied by a study of passenger ship safety which covered 36 passenger vessel accidents or incidents that killed 176 people and injured another 364 in the last 15 years. Although only five of the fatalities were in foreign-flagged cruise ship accidents, board members said the potential for a major catastrophe is high. The ships regularly carry several hundred passengers but often have no plans for handling a major emergency, investigators said. `` We're seeing a lot of vessels 10 years old with a brand new coat of paint but lacking any of the safety equipment we're seeing on newer vessels,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON>, acting board chairman. The board can only recommend actions and has no rule-making powers. Its final report, which is to be edited and revised before release, will be sent to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, passenger ship companies and other interested parties. The board asked the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> to seek authority to investigate accidents in international waters involving passenger vessels that regularly operate out of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ports, regardless of the flag they fly. Investigations now usually are conducted by the country where the ship is registered, and board officials say the inquiries often do little to protect the safety interests of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens. Nearly all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cruise companies register their ships in countries where requirements are less strict than those for U.S.-registered ships. The board urged that all passenger vessels operating out of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ports be required to meet international safety regulations as well as additional requirements. The report called for centralized fire control systems, heat and smoke detectors with automatic fire door releases, sprinkler systems, fire doors with holes for hoses to pass through and an English-speaking crew that can communicate with each other and passengers in an emergency. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauber </PERSON>, another board member, said passenger ship companies have been `` driving through loopholes'' in the law that allow them to escape safety regulations applying to larger vessels.

<HEAD>Ag Department Betting Crop Estimates Will be Better Than Last Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 New Agriculture Department estimates of 1989 crop production based on Oct. 1 field conditions have a good chance of being close to the final figures when the harvest is all in. In the case of corn production, for example, the new estimate to be released later today will have a `` confidence level'' of about 90 percent, meaning that chances are nine out of 10 that the October estimate will be close to the final mark. But sometimes those heavy odds are n't quite enough to be on the money, according to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> statisticians. Take last year's drought riddled corn harvest. The Oct. 12, 1988, report by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> put corn output at 4.55 billion bushels, down 36 percent from about 7.07 billion bushels in 1987. Statistically, the report said, chances were two out of three that the October corn estimate of 4.55 billion bushels would not be above or below the final estimate by more than 3.8 percent, or approximately 173 million bushels. Further the 1988 report said chances were nine out of 10 the difference would not be more than 6.6 percent, or about 300 million bushels. As it turned out, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn crop was about 4.92 billion bushels, according to current estimates for 1988. That meant the October forecast was about 7.5 percent, or 370 million bushels, below the final corn output. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Davies </PERSON>, head of statistical methods in the department's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday that although a forecast may be within a certain leeway 90 percent of the time, `` one out of 10 times you expect it to be out of that range. <PERSON> Davies </PERSON> added in a telephone interview that many variables may account for the give-or-take statistical cushion, including the possibility of early snow storms in northern states, late-planted crops and changes in figures for the number of acres to be harvested. In the last 10 years, the October forecast has been below the final corn production figures in seven years and above it in three years. The new Oct. 1 crop estimates for 1989 production _ including corn, soybeans and cotton _ will be revised in November. All crops will be subject to fine-tuning in later reports. Right now, the crop situation for 1989 looks vastly improved from 1988's drought-shriveled output. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Seaborg </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, writing in his agency's Agricultural Outlook magazine before the October estimates were made, noted the index of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crop production dropped 16 percent last year because of drought. `` Production this year is rebounding to just below 1987's levels, but will still fall short of the production in the early and mid-1980s,'' <PERSON> Seaborg </PERSON> said `` Cotton production, an exception to the rebound, is declining because of reduced acreage.'' Although 1989 weather has been less than ideal, it has helped boost overall crop outlook. Also, farmers boosted plantings for some key commodities. `` Farmers increased acreage because crop prices were the highest in several years, and because government acreage-reduction provisions were relaxed, allowing operators to expanding plantings and still be eligible for benefits,'' he said. Again, cotton was the exception, as the government tightened acreage restrictions because of market conditions. <PERSON> Seaborg </PERSON> said crop yields per acre are `` a better measure than production of the impact of mixed weather patterns'' on the nation's agriculture. Citing September figures, <PERSON> Seaborg </PERSON> noted 1989 corn and oats yields may be up by one-third from last year's low levels, while barley, soybean and hay yields are up about one-fifth. But the yield of all wheat is down about 4 percent from last year, with `` marked increases in spring wheat yields are being more than offset by an approximately 11 percent drop in winter wheat yields,'' he said. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stockpile of most crops will again be whittled down but will `` remain above pipeline needs during the 1989-90 season,'' <PERSON> Seaborg </PERSON> said. `` The drawdown in stocks will also occur in other countries, but the rate of decline will be much less.'' Meanwhile, he said, the farm prices of most crops `` will remain sensitive to weather developments this winter, both here and abroad.'' And that wo n't be the end of it. `` Farmers could well expand -LRB- crop -RRB- acreage again this winter and next year, responding to similar factors that boosted planted acreage this season,'' <PERSON> Seaborg </PERSON> added. `` Thus, 1990 weather conditions will again be the focal point of the crop outlook.''

<HEAD>About 94 Percent of Schools Submit Asbestos Plans</HEAD>

 The government says most of the country's schools are complying with federal asbestos regulations, but more than 3,000 schools still have not submitted asbestos management plans required a year ago The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> acknowledged many schools have been slow in complying with a 1986 law that required inspections for asbestos in school buildings and established deadlines for developing asbestos management plans and remedial work if necessary. Asbestos is a cancer-causing substance once widely use for insulation. It is particularly dangerous in exposed fiber form where tiny particles are easily spread in the air. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that as of late September, about 94 percent of the 50,544 local school agencies or individual schools subject to the federal requirements have submitted management plans to state officials. The plans were due in October 1988, but many schools received extensions to last May. Even then, some schools did not submit their complete action plans until just recently, officials said. The EPA statistics on how fast the schools are dealing with the health matter represented reporting by both public and private schools. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> McElheny </PERSON> said as of late September, about 6 percent, or 3,094 of the school entities, had not submitted the required asbestos management plans to state agencies. He said the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> had no statistics on how many school had actually begun work to remedy asbestos problems. Agency officials, nevertheless, were pleased with the 94 percent rate of compliance to the reporting requirement. `` We are greatly pleased with the high rate of compliance,'' said <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> Assistant Administrator <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>. `` Our nation's schools are serious about tackling the asbestos problem. It was unclear from the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> statistics how many school buildings were represented by the reporting requirements. <PERSON> McElheny </PERSON> said in some cases states reported actions by individual schools, while in other cases reports were submitted on the basis of `` local education agencies'' which could include anywhere from a single school to a large metropolitan school district. Also, there was no breakdown available on the performance of private schools vs. public school systems. `` We do n't know how many -LRB- of the reports -RRB- were private and how many were public schools,'' <PERSON> McElheny </PERSON> said. Officials said schools in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> were not included in the compliance figure because the state not yet completed processing the latest submissions due to budget constraints. The 1986 law required school officials to begin implementing the action plans by July 9, 1989. But many schools had yet to submit the management plans by that date. According to <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> requirements, schools have several options for dealing with asbestos in buildings, from removing it altogether to keeping it in place and sealing it off from school occupants. Ms. <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> said often the best approach may be to seal the asbestos because attempts to remove it might throw small asbestos particles might be thrown into the air.

 A woman whose skeleton was found near <LOCATION> Seattle-Tacoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> is the 41st confirmed victim of the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> killer, investigators said. The remains of <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Childers </PERSON>, who was 19 when she disappeared in 1983, were found Wednesday just 50 yards from where three other victims had been uncovered six years ago, authorities said. Capt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, said late Wednesday he had no doubt she was the 41st victim. Eight other young women are missing and believed slain by the killer. `` The time of disappearance, what little we know now about the background of the victim is similar to a lot of our victims,'' he said. `` The location ... the circumstances of the found victim, those kinds of things are certainly indicative of a <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> victim.'' `` She was known to associate with prostitution,'' said <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> King </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> police spokesman. Many prostitutes were among the victims in the killings, which occurred from the summer of 1982 to early 1984. The killer operated primarily in the Puget Sound area; the bodies of the first five victims were found near the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, giving the case its name. No arrests have been made, but <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, 38, of <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>, has been described by task force investigators as a `` viable suspect.'' He has been jailed in <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> on federal weapons charges. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> said it was not known what impact the discovery of the skeleton might have on the 7-year-old investigation. The identification was made through dental records. `` We always hope we'll find someone -LRB- who -RRB- maybe can give us some information and other leads to follow,'' he said. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> said the task force has always believed there may be more victims. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Childers </PERSON> was last seen by her boyfriend in April 1983, when police in suburban <PERSON> Edmmonds </PERSON> received a missing person report about her. She was on her way to a shopping area frequented by prostitutes near the airport. <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> investigators were called to a site south of the airport on Wednesday after a worker who was cutting brush found a skull. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> said a complete skeleton was recovered and given to the medical examiner's office. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said the skeleton was less than 50 yards from where searchers found the remains of victims in June and November 1983. Records indicate the bodies of three victims were found in the area in late 1983. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said it was not known how long Ms. <PERSON> Childers </PERSON>' remains had been at the site.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is meeting stiff resistance to its plan to spread plutonium-contaminated wastes from the <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flats </ORGANIZATION> nuclear weapons plant among seven states in order to avert a plant shutdown early next year. White House chief of staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials urged the seven governors and members of the states' congressional delegations Wednesday to temporarily handle equal amounts of waste from the Rocky Flats plant next year `` My answer is absolutely not,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> <PERSON> Derrick </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, whose district includes the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> weapons plant that is among the sites targeted by the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for interim storage of the radioactive waste. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> does n't know the definition of the word ` temporary,''' <PERSON> Derrick </PERSON> said in an interview. He noted 35 million gallons of radioactive waste have been stored `` temporarily'' at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, for decades. Most of the seven states _ <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> _ had indicated earlier this week they would not accept any of the waste, which contains plutonium that remains radioactive for 240,000 years. `` The answer is still no,'' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> said after receiving a call from <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>. He added that although the federal government probably had the legal authority to force any state to take the waste, he did not intend to relent. The administration says closing <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flats </ORGANIZATION> would amount to unilateral nuclear disarmament since it is the sole maker of plutonium triggers for warheads. Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Skaggs </PERSON>, D-Colo., whose district includes Rocky Flats, said he saw little chance that other states would be persuaded to voluntarily take the surplus waste `` This has no more possibility of flying than a lead dirigible,'' <PERSON> Skaggs </PERSON> said in an interview. `` It's an enormous political hurdle for any governor to get over.'' Colorado Gov. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Romer </PERSON>, citing a public health hazards from continued accumulations of waste at <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flats </ORGANIZATION>, has vowed to close the plant if the waste exceeds 1,600 cubic yards. The Energy Department estimates that limit will be topped by March. Rocky Flats is about 16 miles from <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. The department had expected to have a permanent repository near <LOCATION> Carlsbad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, ready by this fall to store the Rocky Flats waste, but a series of technical and regulatory setbacks has delayed the repository's opening until at least July. In briefings for congressional delegations from the seven states, <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials identified eight sites in seven states that <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> wants to put the excess Rocky Flats wastes for two years, and possible longer. They are: The <ORGANIZATION> Idaho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>; the Hanford Reservation near <LOCATION> Richland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alamos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alamos </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>; the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant near <LOCATION> Carlsbad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>; the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> Test Site, near <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>; the Oak Ridge Reservation near <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>; the Rocky Flats plant; and the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Site </LOCATION>. The sites were chosen because they already hold vast amounts of defense nuclear waste. <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>'s chief adviser on nuclear waste issues, toured <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> on Wednesday to brief those states' governors on a new timetable for completing the permanent waste dump in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last week the dump would not be ready to open before next July 1 at the earliest. <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> said after a one-hour meeting with <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> that he was not asked to accept any of the Rocky Flats waste, but indicated he would have turned down any request. <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> had been storing the waste at the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Idaho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>, but <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> halted shipments Sept. 1 That was the date <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> had promised he'd have the $ 800 million Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> ready to permanently entomb all waste generated at Rocky Flats. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, while not opposed to the permanent waste repository, has battled the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> over environmental and technical aspects of the project and voiced concern that it not open prematurely just to fix the Rocky Flats problem.

 <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s communist leaders have little choice but to make reforms like those in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> under President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, say two top West German military officials. `` It's inconceivable that -LRB- <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB- will stay as it is'' in view of changes in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, West German Defense Minister <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> told reporters after meeting with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON>, who met with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Tuesday, and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON>, a former West German defense minister who visited <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Wednesday, held separate news conferences on Wednesday. They both said <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and other East European countries will face mounting problems if they continue to resist reforms. `` The major disagreeable thing for them is that if they continue ... their tough repression, they will not be able to manage the change, they will not be able to peacefully develop their countries,'' <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> added: `` If they do not move, there could be even further growing tensions. And you could imagine some very dangerous developments we all should want to avoid.'' But <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> said East German reforms wo n't lead to reunification of East and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> anytime soon. Reunification would have to wait until democracy spreads through the rest of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and could be accomplished within German confederation in the larger European Community, he said. West German officials understood from Soviet authorities that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s public calls for greater flexibility by <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> were repeated in his private meetings with East German leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON>. `` Indications give us the impression that he said, ` You must go on and move ahead; otherwise, the situation gets dangerous,''' <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> indicated on Saturday that he planned to stick to his hard-line approach as his country tries to stem the flow of its citizens to the West. More than 100,000 East Germans have fled this year, some of them by climbing over walls into the embassies of western nations. The East German <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s Politburo issued a statement Wednesday indicating far more flexibility. `` All expressions of opinion and suggestions for attractive socialism in the GDR -LRB- <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB- are important,'' it said. `` We are open to discussions.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is working to keep the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact together while revitalizing <ORGANIZATION> COMECON </ORGANIZATION>, the Soviet bloc economic counterpart to the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> `` may not like all attitudes and decisions of the communist leadership in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, -LRB- but -RRB- he wants to keep them in the camp and work with them,'' he said. The defense minister said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> appears ready `` to tolerate remarkable special movements'' in different East European countries, but that `` the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact stays together'' even if in a new form. <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Monday and has met <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials including Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. He is due to visit <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and German forces at military bases in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> before returning to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> Friday. <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> has been holding similar meetings.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> paid the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> $ 730 to fly Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> May 15 and spent $ 5,260 for the return trip the next day on a <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> jet, government records show. The twin-engine <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> jet flew from <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to take <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> back to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> after the attorney general voted in the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> primary, met with <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents and was interviewed by a hometown radio station. The May 16 return flight was one of three trips <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> took aboard <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> aircraft in the last five months at a total cost of $ 80,181, according to travel records released by <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON>. The figures show <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> spent $ 154,618 for 47 flights on government aircraft between Oct. 7, 1988 and Sept. 4, 1989. That was more than twice the travel expenses incurred by his predecessor during a comparable time period. Trips by former Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> cost the government $ 74,247 between Oct. 1, 1987 and when he left office Aug. 8, 1988, <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> acknowledged <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> has traveled more frequently than <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> but attributed much of the greater cost to `` the incredible charges of the Marshals Service'' for their planes. `` The attorney general told me when he saw those charges for the first time he ordered ... those charges reviewed to determine if the department is being ripped off,'' said <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON>. He said <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> told him the charges `` appear to be outrageous and that he wants them looked at again.'' <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s accountants `` went over the bills in some detail before they reimbursed us to determine if they were indeed valid and justifiable and apparently felt they were because they paid the bill'' for all three flights. <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> said the bills reflected the costs of fuel the <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> used to fly the planes. A letter <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> wrote last week to two news organizations detailing the travel expenses said the twin-engine jet <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> took for the <LOCATION> Pittsburgh-to-Washington </LOCATION> flight was requested May 12, three days before the attorney general left <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> turboprop. <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> made <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON>'s letter and a similar response by <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Milt </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahlerich </PERSON> available to reporters. The letters were written in response to questions from <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Times. The <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> also listed a $ 46,792 bill for <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s Aug. 6-9 trip to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> for meetings with <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> officials and to <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, where the attorney general addressed the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> Following the <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> meetings, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> and several aides flew from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> aboard a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 normally used by the <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to transport prisoners. In addition to the expenses it billed the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> estimated that it cost $ 32,232 to divert the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 from carrying federal prisoners. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> and his aides also flew a twin-engine <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> jet on a June 12-14 trip to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> at a cost of $ 28,118. <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> has been flying aboard government aircraft because of <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> concerns about his personal security and the secrecy of his communications while in flight.

 Some Democrats are already claiming that Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>' losing bid to place further restrictions on abortion will hurt his re-election chances next year. The <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> defeated a series of anti-abortion proposals by the governor, then adjourned its special session Wednesday. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> taxpayers spent more than $ 100,000 for the fruitless session, the third called by the governor this year. Even the first-term <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> governor's glib campaign manager, J.M. `` Mac'' <PERSON> Stipanovich </PERSON>, was n't his usual talkative self. `` I'm not going to spin it,'' he said `` It's an issue he feels strongly about. I'm going to let him do it.'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said he was unconcerned about taking a political risk on abortion. `` I stood for my convictions,'' he said. `` I do n't think the people in any state have an adverse feeling for someone who stands up for his convictions `` With me, it was a matter of value, a matter of conviction, not a matter of politics.'' House Republican Leader <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Patchett </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Langley </PERSON> said they thought the session may have helped the governor slightly by solidifying his support among anti-abortionists. `` I think the governor will have a net gain,'' <PERSON> Langley </PERSON> said. `` People have got to respect him. He knew it was not a popular thing to do, but it was a genuine conviction of his.'' State Republican Chairman <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Poole </PERSON> also was busy Wednesday trying to repair any damage done to the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>'s lead candidate for next year. `` He had a lot of courage to call this session,'' said <PERSON> Poole </PERSON>. Many Democrats said <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> would pay the price at the polls next year for his anti-abortion stance. `` The governor's profile as a blundering manager, as a blundering political strategist who can not read the sentiment of the people of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> is now carved in stone,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferro </PERSON>. `` There's nothing he can do to chisel away at it and make it better. That is the profile Floridians are going to be voting for or against next year.'' State Sen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON>, who is seeking the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, said <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> wasted taxpayers' money by insisting on the session. And the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, Rep. <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> `` has awakened a sleeping giant and they will be there to help him be defeated.'' On Tuesday, Republican state Sen. <PERSON> Marlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodson-Howard </PERSON> decided she would challenge <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination come September. `` This is costing the governor a great deal,'' said <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Smeal </PERSON>, president of the Fund for the Feminist Majority. `` If nothing else, he's seeing a primary he might not otherwise have.'' Although the abortion issue itself was n't the key reason for her candidacy, <PERSON> Woodson-Howard </PERSON> said the governor's insistence on the unpopular session was another example of ignoring lawmakers' wishes. `` He did n't build consensus and he did n't count his votes, and I think that's crucial,'' she said.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> investigators have found no evidence to support charges the <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement still holds political prisoners _ but also failed to determine the whereabouts of 315 alleged detainees, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official says. <PERSON> Martti </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahtisaari </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> contingent monitoring <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s transition to independence, said Wednesday that the search for the missing people would nevertheless continue. Under the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION>'s independence plan, both the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and the South African-led security forces were required to release all prisoners. Many of the more than 200 people freed by <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> alleged that hundreds of others had been held along with them and either were dead or still in custody. <PERSON> Ahtisaari </PERSON> sent an eight-member investigating team last month to <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> maintained camps during its 23-year bush war against <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> African rule of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. The team's report, released Wednesday, said 448 of 1,100 allegedly missing people were alive and free, 71 were found to have never been detained and 115 were believed to have died in circumstances that were not specified. Others could not be identified and 315 were unaccounted for. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> investigators said they visited 30 locations in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> during their three-week trip, including six sites where prisons definitely operated. They said the prisons had been dismantled and vacated. <PERSON> Ahtisaari </PERSON> said the team found no evidence that the alleged detainees had been moved from any of the locations. Many of the former <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> detainees have alleged they were kept in underground pits and tortured persistently into making false confessions that they were South African spies. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> officials have acknowledged torture did take place. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has ruled <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> since World War I, but agreed last year to grant independence as part of a regional treaty that also calls for withdrawal of Cuban troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s northern neighbor <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> is favored to win the most votes in U.N.-supervised elections Nov. 7-11 for an assembly that will draft a constitution for an independent <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. It must win two-thirds of the votes to have total control over the assembly.

 Banner-waving youths opposed to <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> rule of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Timor </LOCATION> fought baton-wielding police in the territory today before the altar where Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> was finishing his benediction to about 60,000 people. At least four people were injured. Hurling chairs and shouting `` Viva independence!'' and `` Viva Papa!'' about 20 youths unfurled a banner in front of the the altar. As the pope looked on, plainclothes police hit the youths with canes. Much of the crowd scattered, but about 100 people came to the aid of the youths, hurling chairs at the police. The protesters were supporters of Fretilin, the pro-independence movement that has been fighting <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> troops since the <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> left the former colony in 1975 and it was annexed by <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>. They got to within 100 feet of the steps to the high altar where the pope stood watching. The pope did not seem directly threatened. In his homily, the pontiff had urged <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> to respect the human rights of the people of predominantly <LOCATION> Catholic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Timor </LOCATION>, which comprises half of <LOCATION> Timor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in the southeastern reaches of the <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> archipelago. As white-cassocked priests and seminarians moved quickly to calm the crowd, the pope, surrounded by <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> bodyguards, moved toward his car. From there he went directly to the airport as scheduled and flew off to <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, the world's most populous Moslem country. After he left, youths began to chant `` Viva Fretilin!'' <ORGANIZATION> Dili </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> reported four women admitted after the incident, all of whom had been battered by the surging crowd. There was no immediate report of arrests. Girl Scouts, who had been serving as ushers in front of the altar, wept as they were caught up in the clash. The incident lasted about 15 minutes. The crowd then left the dusty arena peacefully. Security at the Mass was light and provided by unarmed police and militia. The <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> army, which has a garrison of 13,000 in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Timor </LOCATION>, was apparently not deployed. <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> admits to having suffered `` thousands of casualties'' in the guerrilla war over the territory Portual ruled for 450 years. <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> had dismissed the strength of the separatist guerrillas, saying only 200 remain in the hinterland. In his homily, the pope made no direct mention of <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> rule, which is not recognized by the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>, but referred instead to `` those who are responsible for life in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Timor </LOCATION>.'' Addressing the crowd, the pope urged <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> to `` act with wisdom and good will towards all'' in the search for a peaceful solution to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Timor </LOCATION>'s problems. Referring to the anti-Indonesian guerrilla war, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said East Timorese had `` experienced destruction and death as a result of conflict.'' `` You have known what it means to be victims of hatred and struggle,'' he said. `` Many innocent people have died while others have been prey to retaliation and revenge. `` For too long you have been suffering a lack of stability which has rendered your future uncertain. This distressing situation'' has prevented the economic development needed to prevent hunger and unemployment. The pope urged <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> to bring about `` a speedy improvement of conditions of life'' in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Timor </LOCATION>. The visit came on the fourth day of his pilgrimage to <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>. The pope was met by Defense Minister <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdani </PERSON>, the former army commander who planned the takeover of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Timor </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Murdani </PERSON> is the highest placed Roman Catholic in the government of <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, which has 157 million Moslems and 5 million Catholics. <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> has been anxious for the visit to be seen to lend respectability if not official recognition to its rule of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Timor </LOCATION>, which has a population of 590,000, of whom almost 80 percent are <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, according to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. The pope had justified his visit by saying it would be `` an offense to Timorse Catholics'' if he did not visit the former Portuguese colony while on a state visit to <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>.

 The widow of the leader of an unsuccessful coup against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said the military uprising failed because a second military leader pulled a last-minute double-cross. <PERSON> Adela </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonilla </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON> said in interviews published today that the switch helped doom efforts by her husband, Maj. <PERSON> Moises </PERSON> <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON> <PERSON> Vega </PERSON>, to overthrow <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> last week. <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON>, his widow said, planned the coup with a longtime friend, Maj. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Oleochea </PERSON>, commander of the elite Battalion 2000. Battalion 2000, a crack anti-riot unit, was airlifted to the scene of the fighting and _ instead of helping oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> _ went on to lead troops loyal to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in crushing the coup. `` Everything was ready,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. `` But <PERSON> Oleochea </PERSON> was playing a winner's game and he failed to come through because of his cowardice. He committed treason.'' In an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>, she countered <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials' assertions that leaders of the failed coup were divided over what to do with the Panamanian leader. `` Everything was perfectly coordinated,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think there ever was a dispute.'' She told the Times the coup was `` very well organized and coldly calculated.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON>, 36, told both newspapers the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> had been informed in advance of the coup, and the coup had been plotted by junior officers in the Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> fed up with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s alleged corruption and `` drunkenness.'' But the <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> termed Mrs. <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON>'s responses `` evasive'' when she was asked to what extent the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military had promised to help the rebels. `` My husband was convinced that the Americans and his own companions within the defense forces would support him,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON> is staying with her three sons, her brother and her father at a secret location in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. She was not at military headquarters during the Oct. 3 coup attempt. She told the Times her information came from officers who took part in the coup and fled to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON> also told the <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> that her husband may have lost the last chance for a successful coup by not killing <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` My husband may have had a moment of weakness,'' she said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Antonio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> may have violated state or federal laws through questionable spending practices that exceeded $ 4.7 million, according to a federal report.

 A strengthened Typhoon <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> roared toward <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> today after killing at least 30 people, injuring 57 and leaving 142,000 homeless in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, officials said. At least 33 fishermen also were missing after <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> battered <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> and southern areas of <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> Wednesday with 62 mph winds.

In <LOCATION> Batangas </LOCATION> province south of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, the coast guard said 10 people were rescued after two fishing boats collided and sank. Early reports said up to 20 fishermen were missing but officials said all but nine had been accounted for. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>, the 16th tropical storm or typhoon to hit the country this year, slammed late Tuesday into <LOCATION> Sorsogon </LOCATION> province, on the southeastern tip of <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>.

 A doctor and his wife went rummaging through the dump for World Series tickets after he unwittingly left the precious ducats with other papers that had to be thrown away. Dr. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Pam </PERSON>, ended up raking through 3 tons of trash at the Marina garbage disposal site Tuesday before finally finding them. The 43-year-old gastroenterologist had attended the final National League playoff game Monday with his 12-year-old son, <PERSON> Rory </PERSON>. Afterward, they left their Series tickets in the car. The next morning, when <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> started looking for the tickets, the tickets were nowhere to be found. He figured they had been thrown out and called <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disposal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to try to head off the trash truck. <PERSON> Mia </PERSON> <PERSON> Litch </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Monterey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Waste </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> radioed the landfill operators to clear a site for the Smiths to wade through the garbage. `` The people were real nice at the dump,'' said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 The fired warden of the <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penitentiary </ORGANIZATION> operated a cockfighting business at the prison and failed to maintain security and report escapes, the state's corrections chief said <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, who has been on leave since August, was fired Tuesday for eight violations of department policy that alleged administrative malfeasance, said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON>, secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION>. `` I was going to give him the opportunity to retire. ... He chose not to retire,'' <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> told reporters Wednesday. <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> stepped aside as warden after a court-appointed official issued a highly critical report of the prison's operations. But he later filed an appeal with the <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, claiming that Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> coerced him into retiring. <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> asked the commission to reinstate him. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> denied <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> was coerced. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> said he was not involved in the details, but added that <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> `` made the right decision'' in stepping aside. The governor said Wednesday he backed <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON>'s decision to dismiss him According to <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON>, the charges against <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> stemmed from an agency probe that followed allegations leveled by the court-appointed investigator, former warden <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Maggio </PERSON>. <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> was replaced after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Polozola </PERSON> received <PERSON> Maggio </PERSON>'s report, which said the prison suffered from lax management and had failed to properly search inmates and visitors for contraband. <PERSON> Polozola </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Maggio </PERSON> to investigate after a rash of escapes, assaults and suicides at the giant prison at <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. Among <PERSON> Maggio </PERSON>'s report, <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> was raising fighting cocks for sale on the prison grounds, using inmate labor and prison facilities. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> said he had told all wardens to refrain from any personal business activity on June 20, but <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> ignored the order. Several hundred fighting cocks owned by <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> recently were removed from the <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> grounds on <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON>'s orders. <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> also failed to maintain searches of employees and visitors to the prison, which `` resulted in a serious breakdown of security,'' the report said. Drug and other contraband problems in the prison `` were well known to the warden,'' the report said. <PERSON> Annette </PERSON> <PERSON> Viator </PERSON>, an agency attorney, said <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> could appeal the decision to an internal department panel and the <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Under state regulations, <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> could still decide to retire before the appeals process, she said. <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> refused to comment and referred questions to his attorney, <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Falcon </PERSON>. <PERSON> Falcon </PERSON> said he had not received a copy of the charges and declined comment.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> launched a top-level probe today into reports a Syrian major flew a MiG-23 fighter jet undetected across one of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s most sophisticated defense lines before landing at a civilian airfield. The seven minutes that the Syrian pilot spent in Israeli air space before landing and defecting caused an uproar over possible flaws in the air defense system. The daily <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION>'s main headline questioned `` How a MiG Flew for Seven Minutes _ Without Interference.'' The English-language <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> ran a front-page analysis about upgraded Syrian air attack capabilities. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> was angered that he did not even know about the flight until after it landed, the Hadashot daily reported. The investigation was launched by Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON> at the urging of <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> said. It said a brigadier general was heading the probe. Both <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio stations and most newspapers reported the air force failed to scramble inteceptors before the Syrian fighter-bomber landed near <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION>, a city of 250,000. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s most implacable foe in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Golan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, over which the Soviet-built plane swooped into <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, were annexed by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> after being seized from <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. The <ORGANIZATION> Davar </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said the plane came across the <LOCATION> Golan </LOCATION> at a level of just 100 feet at a speed of 745 mph. Witnesses said the plane buzzed houses in the northern town of <LOCATION> Afula </LOCATION> flying at 165 feet and town council leaders demanded to know why civil defense officials were not warned, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio reported. Members of the left-wing <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> and the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Tehiyia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> called for a paraliamentary debate on the flight. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said the plane was detected by Israeli radar officers and patrol aircraft, but refused to confirm or deny reports that the air force failed to scramble fighters to intercept the Syrian warplane. `` All this will be clarified after a full inquiry into the matter,'' he said. The radio said the MiG-23 was carrying two 23-mm cannons and 200 rounds of ammunition but its bomb racks were empty. The plane, flown by Maj. <PERSON> Adel </PERSON> <PERSON> Basem </PERSON>, 34, landed before noon at an airfield used by crop-dusting planes at <LOCATION> Megiddo </LOCATION>, 60 miles north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, an army communique said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said <PERSON> Basem </PERSON> asked for asylum. Workers at the airstrip said they were stunned by the plane's arrival The plane turned around on the runway `` and the pilot got out and said, ` I am asking for asylum, I have no intentions of war,''' the <ORGANIZATION> Haaretz </ORGANIZATION> newspaper quoted one as saying. The radio and major dailies said <PERSON> Basem </PERSON> sat in a supply building at a corner in the airfield for 20 minutes before air force officials arrived. Other witnesses said they saw no Israeli escort planes. <ORGANIZATION> Davar </ORGANIZATION> quotes <PERSON> Basem </PERSON> as telling an airstrip worker that he defected because of poor treatement in the army, including one incident in which secret police broke his arm and hit him in the ribs after he requested better housing. In <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> official said the pilot did not defect but was forced to make an emergency landing. An Israeli army spokesman denied the plane had technical problems. The craft had no visible signs of an engine fire reported by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> indicated <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> could tell that the Syrian plane had no hostile intentions, but refused to provide details, saying: `` It's difficult to explain the difference between an airplane coming to carry out an operation ... and a pilot deciding to cross the border during a training flight.'' He defended <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s handling of the affair, saying: `` In this case, it's good we did not shoot it down. We got an advanced MiG-23 of the MLD version. It's one of the most advanced versions of MiG-23 supplied to the Syrians after 1982.'' `` Of course it will serve as a source of information for us and the others,'' including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said.

 A judge sentenced a former nursing home aide to 20 to 40 years in prison for helping her former lover smother patients, and he agreed to her request that the two be kept in separate prisons. `` Without you, I'm sure this matter never would have been cleared up,'' <ORGANIZATION> Kent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> said Wednesday in sentencing <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>. `` I'm convinced that you truly show remorse. ... I'm also convinced that you are in fact a follower and not a leader.'' <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, 27, admitted she sometimes served as a lookout or diverted supervisors' attention while another aide, <PERSON> Gwendolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, suffocated five patients at Alpine Manor Nursing home in Walker, a northwest suburb of Grand Rapids. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> testified the murder was part of a pact the two hoped would bind their love. She said <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> told her the killings helped her `` relieve tension.'' Wood originally was charged with two counts of first-degree murder. Those charges were dropped after she agreed to plead guilty to one count each of second-degree murder and conspiracy to commit second-degree murder. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> also agreed to testify against <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, who was convicted last month of five counts of first-degree murder. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, 26, of <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, faces a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment without parole. Wood had faced a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. Wood remained silent during sentencing, but her attorney read a statement from her. `` Saying ` I'm sorry' is not enough. Mere words can not express the remorse and guilt I'll have to live with for the rest of my life,'' <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> wrote. `` I was caught up in a mess but do not excuse my action or try to blame anyone for my part of this.'' She also expressed sadness at being unable to watch her 9-year-old daughter grow up. The girl now lives with her father in Grand Rapids. Police began investigating the deaths last year after <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>'s ex-husband said she confessed to him. <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> ordered 20 to 40 years on each count for <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, but said the sentences would be served concurrently in a prison other than where <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> will be lodged when she is sentenced. <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> recommended that <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> be sent to a federal prison. She would become eligible for parole in 16 years, two months. <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunderman </PERSON>, daughter of 60-year-old victim <PERSON> Marguerite </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, said she was pleased with the sentence. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> testified she stood guard outside the room of Chambers, who suffered from Alzheimer's disease, while <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> suffocated her with a washcloth. `` She should have come forward and told people this was happening,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Hunderman </PERSON> said. `` But now that I know that this act did happen to Mom, it seems to settle everything.'' Assistant Kent County Prosecutor <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Schieber </PERSON> said he was satisfied with the sentence. `` Because of <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON>'s cooperation, we were able to bring the full story out,'' he said.

 Sexy clothes with lots of bare skin have become a symbol of the `` moda Milanese.'' A year ago <PERSON> Gianni </PERSON> <PERSON> Versace </PERSON> introduced his Band-Aid mini skirt, no more than 12 inches from top to bottom. There were few who dared to don the skimpy garment, but the message caught on quickly. Above the knee hemlines became a way of life. For the spring-summer 1990, the trend to hike the hemline continues, with mid-thigh the preferred length. In the wake of the mini, designers are also showing a myriad of short-petticoated party dresses and short shorts. For those who prefer to keep their knees to themselves, the <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> runway offers lots of pants, either super loose or skin tight and airy chiffon dresses and skirts which flow softly down to the ankle. But the real novelty in the sexy department is the above the waist nude look. Models with bare backs, bare midriffs, even bare breasts paraded down the runway in a myriad of bra tops, bustiers, low-back dresses and see-through blouses. To emphasize the look, <PERSON> Giorgio </PERSON> <PERSON> Armani </PERSON> in his <ORGANIZATION> Emporio </ORGANIZATION> collection sent a model down the runway in nothing but a pair of Armani jeans. This accent on the female torso spells good news for beauty farms and fitness centers. No one will want to be caught with the proverbial midriff bulge. In general, the 40 Italian designers showing their warm weather wears in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> this week, including <PERSON> Armani </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Versace </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Ferre </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Krizia </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Fendi </PERSON> have each gone their individual way, with less of a common thread to the collections than in past seasons. However they have all agreed to promote one item _ the fringe. Usually long and silky it appears on shawls and scarves, as well as decoration on any type of clothing. Often it makes up the hemline of a skirt or dress. In the color department the news is that bright shades are back on the <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> runway after many a season of drab grays and browns. Designers draw inspiration for their cheerful palette, from the rich colors of tropical fruit, or the many fruit flavors of Italian ice cream: mango, banana, papaya, coconut, kiwi, raspberry, apricot, peach, watermelon, orange, lemon, lime and many more. Footwear for next spring and summer will be mostly flat by day, and sometimes even by night. The newest shoe is the <ORGANIZATION> Krizia </ORGANIZATION> ankle strap platform shoe, taken right out of the 1940's. Gold and beads are back in a big way, appearing in large bracelets, necklaces and earrings, as well as decoration and sequining in the more eleborate evening wear. The five-day, semi-annual Italian ready to wear shows end Thursday night with a gala performance by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s Bolshoi theater, at <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>'s famed La Scala opera house, followed by a buffet dinner in the foyer.

<HEAD>Company Distributing AIDS-linked Pneumonia-Fighting Drug Free to
Poor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The maker of a drug used to combat AIDS-linked pneumonia is giving it free to poor patients, but those who can afford to pay for treatment will continue to do so, company officials said. <ORGANIZATION> Lyphomed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in February announced plans to give away the drug, pentamidine, but actual distribution was held up until June pending full government approval of the drug, spokeswoman <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsden </PERSON> said Wednesday. The company, based in suburban <LOCATION> Rosemont </LOCATION>, charges about $ 100 wholesale for a monthly dose. Patients pay up to $ 200 for the same dose through doctors and pharmacies. AIDS activists and others have accused Lyphomed of overcharging for the substance. But the company maintains its charge is appropriate, given the research money it spent developing the drug. Community health organizations have been notified of the availablity of pentamidine for the poor and for those who lack insurance to cover its costs. The company said it will send supplies of the drug several times a year to groups of doctors who have large AIDS practices in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. The groups are filling out questionnaires that ask them how much pentamidine they think they will need. The company said it also may send the drug to other groups. <ORGANIZATION> Lyphomed </ORGANIZATION>'s action represents the first time a company has distributed an approved drug to poor patients free of charge, company officials and <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. Since 1984, <ORGANIZATION> Lyphomed </ORGANIZATION> has produced an injectable form of the drug for use in patients who already have contracted pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, a life-threatening form of pneumonia that is the leading cause of death among AIDS patients. In June, the company obtained approval for marketing an aerosol version to be taken once every four weeks as a preventive measure by people likely to contract that form of pneumonia. Last month, the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> With </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AIDS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> said it would import the drug from <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, where is it cheaper, and sell it to AIDS patients in this country at a lower cost than the drug can be bought here.

<HEAD>Homosexuals Hold `Coming Out' Day</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Many of those who attended a second annual `` National Coming Out Day'' around the country acknowledged that they were veterans of homosexual-pride events, and they said the real `` coming out'' process is done privately. `` My coming out was when I opened the dictionary at age 14 and looked up the word ` homosexual' and realized that applies to me,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Blakeslee </PERSON>, 34, of <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Blakeslee </PERSON> was among some 50 people who attended a rowdy <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Statehouse </LOCATION> rally and said they hoped it would encourage others to seek out the state's homosexual community rather than isolating themselves in despair. `` Gay youth has three times the risk for suicide as straight teens,'' said <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Winkleman </PERSON>, 22, of <LOCATION> Warwick </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION> `` When I was a teen, I was afraid that my parents would stop loving me.'' Elsewhere, hundreds of homosexual men and women celebrated their sexuality with rallies, films and discussions Wednesday. `` National Coming Out Day is great. It's like a holiday,'' said <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheek </PERSON>, executive assistant at the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Gay and <ORGANIZATION> Lesbian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, where about 500 people gathered. The celebration at the center included discussion of such films as `` The Life and <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harvey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Milk </ORGANIZATION>,'' about <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s murdered homosexual city supervisor Cheek said the day's highlight was an open microphone at which people could tell their own stories of coming out _ slang for publicly acknowledging one's homosexuality. `` Some were funny, but there were a lot of tear-jerkers,'' he said. `` We had a lot of first-timers.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION>, students were asked to wear black or pink to support the celebration. Black, always a popular choice of students, proliferated on campus by midmorning. `` This campus is so diverse, civility and being aware of social issues is really important,'' said <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, a senior and president of the school's Lesbian Bisexual and Gay Alliance. In <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> gave all but final approval Wednesday to a bill banning discrimination against homosexuals in housing, credit and employment. The bill, which has died in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for each of the last 17 years, moved along after <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bulger </PERSON> ruled that amendments offered by several opponents were merely delaying tactics. `` This really is the people's victory,'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> LaFontaine </PERSON> of the Coalition for Lesbian and Gay Civil Rights. `` We are going to herald this as a major step forward in the civil rights movement.'' The Atlanta Gay Center sponsored a help-line and bought local advertising to commemorate a homosexual rights march in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> two years ago. Homosexual residents had their names printed in the ads as part of the commemoration. North of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Marin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervisors </ORGANIZATION> voted 4-0 to proclaim Wednesday `` Marin Coming Out Day,'' despite protests by evangelical ministers that the county should not be endorsing homosexual lifestyles. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Searle </PERSON>, pastor at <ORGANIZATION> Marin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Novato </LOCATION>, said he was `` very disappointed'' because the board's action `` will be perceived by the community as an endorsement of the lifestyle.'' Supervisor <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Aramburu </PERSON>, one of two who wore `` Coming Out'' buttons, said the proclamation reflects a `` spirit of respect.'' `` I think we respect one another as human beings,'' he said. Cheek said holding the annual day helps end homophobia by letting the heterosexual world know that there are homosexuals all around them. `` If you find out your next door neighbor that you've known all along is gay, then how can you hate him?'' Cheek said.

<HEAD>Parents' Complaints About Devil Worship Cancel Halloween Events</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FREDERICK, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Fewer students in ghost and goblin get-ups will be parading through the halls of <LOCATION> Frederick </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> schools this Halloween because of some parents' complaints that the holiday is linked to devil worship. Several schools have canceled traditional Halloween costume parties, opting to hold fall and harvest celebrations instead. Other schools are bypassing Halloween altogether, asking children to dress up as storybook characters in conjunction with National Children's Book Week in mid-November. `` I personally have trouble defending ghosts and goblins in our instructional curriculum,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, a county school superintendent, said Wednesday. Other parents believe school officials have overreacted to the 15 to 20 parents who complained, <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. But he said school officials thought the parents had a legitimate concern. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamblin </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, said that although satanic activities have been brought to the attention of school officials across the state, he had never heard of Halloween parties being canceled in any other <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> schools. In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, similar parental complaints have prompted a school district to considering limiting observance of the holiday, too. `` I asked the school board to ban Halloween because it's a religious holiday,'' <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Magee </PERSON>, director of children's education at the 800-member, non-denominational <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fellowship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday. Tuesday night, the <ORGANIZATION> Harlingen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> appointed a committee to examine Halloween's role in the schools. About 200 members of area churches showed up, some wearing orange anti-Halloween buttons. Committee members said they were not ready to decide on whether to ban Halloween. <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION> school Superintendent <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON> said at a Wednesday morning meeting he advised principals that `` in situations where they were coming on strong with witches and witches' brews and all that kind of stuff, perhaps they might want to tone it down a bit and concentrate on pumpkins and that sort of thing.'' `` He agreed to take the yucky stuff out,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Magee </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` Man, that's a major step.'' But she wants all Halloween witches, witches' brews, ghosts and goblins and what she calls `` the dark side'' out of the schools, and hopes the school board makes the decision at its next meeting. `` The Christian religion is not allowed the same privilege in the schools,'' she said. <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON>, however, said Halloween always has been seen as a spoof of an old superstition. `` And kids have always looked on it as a fun time and a spoof rather than anything serious like this,'' <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Frederick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> Superintendent <PERSON> Noel </PERSON> <PERSON> Farmer </PERSON> has not issued a policy on Halloween, but at least three elementary schools _ <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Frederick </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Walkersville </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hillcrest </LOCATION> _ have discontinued Halloween events. Others have changed the focus of the parties. <ORGANIZATION> Middletown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Principal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clever </ORGANIZATION> said some parents keep their children home from school to prevent them from participating in Halloween parties. To keep the children in class, the school decided to hold a fall celebration instead. `` We've requested that the students not come as witches and goblins and ghoulish characters,'' he said.

 `` All three of them have developed exact methods of measurement which has made it possible to conduct experiments that might force us to reconsider some basic physical laws, especially regarding time and space,'' said <PERSON> Ingvar </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindgren </PERSON>, chairman of the awarding committee. <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON>'s invention yielding the cesium atomic clock is the basis for the present standard of time, with an accuracy of about one part in ten thousand billion, or 10 followed by 13 zeros. He also introduced the hydrogen-maser technique, the most stable source of electromagnetic radiation and a method for studying `` the hyperfine structure of hydrogen with extreme precision,'' the academy said. It also is used to measure short lengths of time and shifts in frequency. <PERSON> Dehmelt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> were cited for developing ways of trapping atoms to study a single electron or ion with extreme precision. `` The methods have been used in testing fundamental physical principles such as quantum electrodynamics ... -LRB- and in -RRB- space communication for measuring continental drift,'' the academy said.

 Two black activists accused of making anti-Semitic comments have resigned from the mayoral campaign of Democrat <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jitu </PERSON> <PERSON> Weusi </PERSON>, who had headed African Americans for <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> `` Sonny'' <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> volunteer, resigned Wednesday. <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> said <PERSON> Weusi </PERSON> was leaving the campaign of his own volition. The Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith accused <PERSON> Weusi </PERSON> of writing `` scores of anti-Semitic articles'' and of having referred to Jews as `` vile money-changers'' and `` shylocks.'' <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Fishlow </PERSON> said <PERSON> Weusi </PERSON> denied the substance of the charges. In a letter to <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> campaign manager <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>, <PERSON> Weusi </PERSON> said, `` I harbor no anti-Semitic views now, nor have I in the past.'' <PERSON> Weusi </PERSON> said he was stepping down so he would not `` deflect New Yorkers from the real issues.'' The <ORGANIZATION> ADL </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Weusi </PERSON> also read an anti-Semitic poem, reportedly by a high school student, on the radio 21 years ago. According to <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, <PERSON> Weusi </PERSON> has repudiated that poem many times. In a letter written last Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> ADL </ORGANIZATION> complained to <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> that <PERSON> Weusi </PERSON> wrote in 1971 that Jews had to be eliminated `` by any means necessary.'' It also said that in 1968, <PERSON> Weusi </PERSON>, under his former name of <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, recited a poem on radio station <ORGANIZATION> WBAI </ORGANIZATION> which began: `` Hey, Jew boy, with that yarmulke on your head.

The <ORGANIZATION> ADL </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Weusi </PERSON> used the pen name `` Big Black'' and wrote several anti-Jewish articles for a publication called Black News. <PERSON> Weusi </PERSON> denied using such a name. The <ORGANIZATION> ADL </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> made anti-Semitic remarks in 1967. <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> said Wednesday that <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> had no official role in his organization.

 The Navajos' suspended chairman has been charged with taking more than $ 400,000 in bribes and kickbacks while leader of the nation's biggest Indian tribe. He promised to `` stand up and fight'' the allegations. The criminal complaints filed Wednesday in <ORGANIZATION> Navajo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> also included charges of fraud, conspiracy and elections violations against the suspended chairman, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>, who is under investigation by a special <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee. Special prosecutors hired by the tribal council also filed charges against <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>'s son and the tribe's suspended vice chairman. <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> was charged with more than 100 offenses. One complaint charges him with bribery, fraud, ethics violations and conspiracy in the tribe's purchase of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boquillas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ranch </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> in 1987. A second complaint alleges violations of the Navajo election law, including charges that <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> accepted $ 115,500 in undocumented cash and services from non-Indians and corporations. A third charges him with bribery, extortion and other counts in connection with consulting contracts <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> purportedly entered into with outside businesses in 1986 through 1989. Prosecutors allege he pocketed more than $ 300,000. <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>'s son <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> `` Rocky'' <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> is charged with conspiracy in the ranch purchase in a fourth complaint and suspended Vice Chairman <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> is accused of ethics violations in a fifth. The elder <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> said the charges were only a rehash of allegations that surfaced during last winter's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Senate hearings. `` Those lazy, good-for-nothing lawyers'' spent thousands of dollars to come up with nothing more than `` allegations using the testimony of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hearings,'' he said. The 60-year-old <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>, who was put on paid administrative leave in February, said he had no plans to resign. `` There's no reason to give up as long as I'm alive and I'm breathing,'' he said `` The cause is valid in terms of these people -LRB- supporters -RRB-, and knowing what is happening to Indian nations _ what has happened to the <LOCATION> Navajo </LOCATION> _ it affects my children and my grandchildren, and I'll continue to stand up and fight.'' Tribal Interim Chairman <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Haskie </PERSON>, meanwhile, said he asked the federal government to speed up its investigation of allegations that <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> shared in the $ 7.2 million profit turned by <ORGANIZATION> Tracey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Scottsdale </LOCATION>, which bought the Big <LOCATION> Boquillas </LOCATION> from <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> for $ 26.2 million and sold it to the Navajos less than 24 hours later for $ 33.4 million. The complaint filed Wednesday alleges that <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> used his position to talk the council into allocating the money. The tribe is suing <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> and others for $ 24 million in damages in the ranch purchase. In January, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Indian Affairs began an investigation of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, but became embroiled in probing corruption of various tribal leaders. The most prominent target was <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>, who was in his fourth term at the helm of the 225,000-member tribe. Among witnesses who testified under immunity of <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>'s taking kickbacks from contractors were <PERSON> Rocky </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>, who said under-the-table payments were referred to as `` golf balls. The elder <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> has maintained that taking gifts is a prerogative of Indian leaders. He repeated his claim that the federal government wants to oust him and other tribal leaders so it can plunder the natural resources on reservations. <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> made his comments Wednesday in this north-central <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> community about 150 miles northwest of the tribal capital and 250 miles north of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>. Appearance summonses will be mailed to <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>, his son and <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>.

 Soldiers shot and killed an unidentified gunman in a shootout in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, and a 25-year-old Palestinian was killed during a clash in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, the army said today. At least five other Palestinians were reported wounded in confrontations with soldiers in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, a 35-year-old woman was hacked to death, apparently by enforcers of the Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule. The shooting in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> occurred after soldiers heard gunfire and saw three fleeing Palestinians, an army spokesman said. The victim, <PERSON> Yassin </PERSON> <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Masri </PERSON>, 25, was the 588th Palestinian killed by soldiers or Israeli civilians in the 22-month-old uprising. Forty Israelis have died in the violence. Palestinian reporters said four Palestinians were wounded besides <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Masri </PERSON> and that the troops opened fire when they were pelted with stones and bottles. Soldiers also shot a 3-year-old boy in the head with a rubber-coated steel ball during a clash with stone-throwers in the Shati refugee camp in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, Arab hospital officials said. He was reported in serious condition. In <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, the body of <PERSON> Nuhzu </PERSON> <PERSON> Mabruka </PERSON>, 35, was found hacked to death in an alley. Palestinians said she was killed because she was a prostitute. At least 128 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs in the uprising. Most have been slain because they were suspected of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities, but some victims have been alleged prostitutes or drug leaders. A military announcement said the pre-dawn battle in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> was in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-declared security zone near the village of <LOCATION> Markabe </LOCATION>, 1 -LCB- miles west of the Israeli border. An army patrol spotted a squad of guerrillas and opened fire, killing one, the announcement said. No Israelis were reported hurt. The army refused to say what happened to the other guerrillas. Military sources said the dead man was from the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION>, a Syrian-backed <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> faction. The army said 71 guerrillas and two <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers have been killed this year in clashes along the border. The last incident was October 3, when two guerrillas were killed and one soldier was slightly injured. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> carved out the security zone when it withdrew the bulk of its forces from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1985 after a three-year occupation. The 6 - to 10-mile-wide strip of land is meant to block attacks on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s northern border

 Executives of <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s national newspaper, say the 7-year-old publication continues to post losses and is experiencing a decline in advertising pages, according to a published report The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> in today's editions quoted the officials as saying <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION>'s flagship paper probably would not be profitable this year, but they were hopeful for its first full-year profit in 1990. `` Not making money this year is somewhat painful because it's something we've been driving for,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Curley </PERSON>, president and chief operating officer of <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, Va.-based <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Curley </PERSON> estimated that <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION>, in which <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> has invested $ 800 million, will end the year with about $ 2 million in losses, down from a loss of $ 26 million in 1988. Nevertheless, he said, `` We consider it a hugely successful year'' for the newspaper overall. The newspaper is being affected by an industry slowdown in advertising and the opening of five new printing sites in the past two years, <PERSON> Curley </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> carried 785 pages of advertising in the third quarter, <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday in its quarterly report. That was the lowest total in almost three years. For the first nine months of 1989, the paper's ad pages were off 4 percent, but its ad revenue was up 13 percent due to higher rates. <PERSON> Curley </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION>'s total revenues would increase to $ 320 million this year, up 7 percent from last year. He also told the Post that circulation between April and September was 1.75 million, an increase of about 100,000 from the same period last year. <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday reported third-quarter earnings were up 11 percent to $ 83.1 million, or 52 cents per share from $ 75.1 million, or 47 cents per share, last year. Newspaper industry analyst <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> that <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION>'s chances of getting into the black next year depend on the strength of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy. `` If things continue to soften and national advertising is weak, they could have another year like this one,'' <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> said. `` If there's a recession, -LRB- profitability -RRB- would be hopeless.''

<TEXT>
 A federal appeals court called body-cavity searches `` dehumanizing and humiliating'' and ruled unconstitutional a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> police policy of conducting such searches on anyone arrested for a felony. The 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, in a 3-0 ruling Wednesday, said the practice violates the constitutional ban on unreasonable searches. `` The intrusiveness of a body-cavity search can not be overstated,'' Judge <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Holcomb </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said in upholding $ 25,000 in damages to a woman searched after her arrest on her roommate's accusation of grand theft Noting that felonies in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> include willful tax evasion and securities fraud, the court said the felony designation has little to do with the likelihood of a suspect's concealing drugs, weapons or other contraband. Police offered no evidence that people arrested on suspicion of a felony were more likely than other inmates to smuggle illegal items into jail, the court said. `` A ham-handed approach to policy-making runs the serious risk of infringing upon detainees' constitutional rights,'' said <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, a conservative appointed to the court by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` Strip searches involving the visual exploration of body cavities -LRB- are -RRB- dehumanizing and humiliating,'' <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said. The court, however, said it was not deciding if strip searches in all felony cases, without inspection of body cavities, were constitutional. No decision has been made on an appeal, said <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Assistant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Helgeson </PERSON>, who said he was disappointed by the ruling. But <PERSON> Alva </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, lobbyist for the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Officers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said the ruling `` would have to be appealed to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>.'' The general rule in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> is that those arrested and confined for more than a few hours are searched for drugs, <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said. `` If someone can tell us how we keep narcotics out of jail -LRB- without a body-cavity search -RRB-, we'd be only too glad to do that. No one likes cavity searches, but at the present time there's no other way,'' <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said.

 <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> defended their $ 100,000 hunt for two inmates who left false clues suggesting they had escaped when they actually were hiding for a week inside the world's largest walled prison `` I'm not embarrassed in the least bit,'' said Detective Sgt. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyer </PERSON>. `` We had information to believe these guys were outside and we followed up on it.'' Prosecuting Attorney <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Filip </PERSON> said Wednesday he will let prison authorities discipline convicted murderer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellah </PERSON>, 42, and robber <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikko </PERSON>, 27, rather than filing any new charges. The prisoners were found Tuesday hiding inside a stack of corrugated boxes in a furniture factory at the 57-acre State Prison of <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. A homemade grappling hook and 84 feet of rope fashioned from nylon laundry bags found with them led authorities to believe the two planned to escape over the 28-foot prison wall after the search for them died down. <PERSON> Boyer </PERSON> said the two left phony clues suggesting they had disguised themselves as guards and escaped during a shift change on Oct. 4. Negatives left in their cells indicated they had made false guard badges, and a note indicated they had bought guard uniforms for $ 250, he said. <PERSON> Mikko </PERSON> also arranged to have a cousin call a probation officer to say she had been asked to pick up the two on the day of the reported escape. `` It certainly leads a reasonable person to believe they had escaped from prison,'' <PERSON> Boyer </PERSON> said, adding the size of the institution made it difficult to determine if they still were inside. <PERSON> Boyer </PERSON> estimated <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> spent more than $ 100,000 searching for the men within <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. The search also extended to <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Bellah </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mikko </PERSON> had friends and relatives. Prison spokeswoman <PERSON> Marcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said prison officials also never stopped searching inside the prison. `` The evidence left in the cell was so obvious we had some doubts whether it was legitimate evidence or whether they were trying to distract us,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Light </PERSON>. Before the escape, the men were held at a level below maximum security and could leave their cells during the day. Depending on the outcome of disciplinary hearings, they could be placed under tigher security and lose privileges. <PERSON> Filip </PERSON> said the county usually prosecutes inmates for new offenses only if aggravated circumstances are involved, such as injury to a prison employee or private citizen. A conviction for attempted escape would add only two to five years to their already long sentences, he said.

 In the Gethsemane Lutheran church in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, thousands of pro-democracy activists find sanctuary as security police roam the streets outside. At sister churches in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION>, East Germans who have been refused permission to emigrate to the West gather weekly for candle-light vigils to protest the government's decision to make them stay. Thousands of East Germans have recently spilled out of the churches and into the streets as protests against the aging Communist leadership's hard-line policies have swelled to record proportions. Suddenly, the church has been plunged into the middle of efforts to achieve political reforms in one of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s most tightly-controlled societies. The church has long sought an uneasy co-existence with the 40-year-old, officially atheist state. The most recent figures available from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> say that between 45 and 48 percent of the population belonged to religious communities in 1987. About 39 percent of the population are Lutherans. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reformation </ORGANIZATION>, was born in <LOCATION> Eisleben </LOCATION>, now in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. While it has championed human rights causes and increasingly pressured the government for more openness and dialogue in society, the <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> has largely steered clear of open confrontation with the state. East German officials have tolerated the church as long as it confines itself to activities on its property, although its publications are routinely censored. After years of relative tranquility, church leaders have found themselves in tense mediations with police to prevent protests from escalating into violence. Their run-down churches have increasingly become forums for disparate opposition groups and pro-democracy supporters. Church leaders are also speaking out more boldly for democratic change. <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Furian </PERSON>, a church provost in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, has called on the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to `` give up its grip on total power.'' Church sources inform Western media of dissident developments and act as mediators between opposition groups and government officials. Opposition groups have flocked to the churches because they are the only haven of free speech in the strictly regulated country. Church property is also off-limits to state security officials under terms of a law separating church and state. While there are similarities to the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s support of the Solidarity movement in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, the German <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> has never had the same influence on daily life as the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Western diplomatic observers and East German church leaders say there are clear limits to the church's new role. Many say its current role has been assumed reluctantly. `` The church has not deliberately chosen this role,'' said a Western diplomat who tracks East German religious affairs. `` It was forced upon it.'' <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> pastor <PERSON> Rainer </PERSON> <PERSON> Eppelmann </PERSON> said the church, in seeking to help many East Germans disillusioned by their society, has found that `` people we're trying to reach out to are being torn apart.'' `` You have to deal with these problems,'' said <PERSON> Eppelmann </PERSON>, who was among the first <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> pastors to give sanctuary to fledgling ecology and human rights groups. <PERSON> Johannes </PERSON> <PERSON> Hempel </PERSON>, the Lutheran bishop of <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION>, said he does not believe the church is actively seeking the forefront of the movement for changes in East German society. `` What is happening now is not really an activity of the churches,'' he said. `` It comes from a large part of the population, and only a small part are Christians.'' <PERSON> Hempel </PERSON> said the church's role is to help `` avoid escalation and violence'' and to build bridges between the opposition and the state. That role will be challenged as opposition leaders continue to demand more dialogue with the government. So far, only Communist officials in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION> have agreed to talk to opposition representatives. Church leaders there played key roles in setting up those talks. Church leaders in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> say `` working groups'' also exist between the church and officials in the capital to discuss solutions to the current unrest. Several church leaders are known to have good contacts with high-ranking party officials. Church officials say they expect their mediation role to continue to be a difficult one because many in the government led by 77-year-old <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> have been unwilling to discuss the need for changes.

 <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> will consider social reforms but will stick to a strict socialist ideology and maintain its grip on power, a high-ranking party official said today. But there were indications of differences within the party hierarchy over how to deal with an increasingly agitated populace demanding more freedoms from the hard-line government. West German media speculated today that 77-year-old <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> may be forced to step down as East German leader. Some <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders warned <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> in a Politburo meeting on Wednesday that unless calls for democratic reforms are urgently addressed, he could face labor unrest, party sources said. After the two-day meeting ended, the Politburo maintained a public unity that offered firm support for the policies of the past but offered an olive branch to a growing movement for reform. The Politburo said in a statement: `` All expressions of opinion and suggestions for attractive socialism in -LRB- <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB- are important. We are open to discussions.'' But any reforms `` will serve the further development of socialism,'' said <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Reinhold </PERSON>, a party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> member and head of the government's Academy for the Social Sciences. `` There is a need for clear positions from the party, as to how the socialist system can be further shaped,'' <PERSON> Reinhold </PERSON> said in a commentary carried today by the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> and the state newspaper <PERSON> Berliner </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeitung </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said he wanted to distinguish the role of the party in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> from that in some other socialist countries. The government in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> has long emphasized it rejects the democratic reforms taking place in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Baerbel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bohley </PERSON>, a co-founder of the opposition group New Forum, described the Politburo statement as a `` verbal shift that does not take into account real life.'' In an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> RIAS </ORGANIZATION> radio in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Bohley </PERSON> said: `` In dialogue, there must be also confrontations, and those who are trying to avoid confrontations are not for real dialogue.'' Meanwhile, the mayor of <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Berghofer </PERSON>, promised to continue talks with the reform-minded Lutheran church and other groups in the city but flatly ruled out accepting any demands made by New Forum. `` We are continuing to talk with one another,'' <PERSON> Berghofer </PERSON> told the East German newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Junge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION>. `` But I said that I am not ready to accept any demands from the New Forum.'' New Forum has been seeking greater openness in East German society and meaningful elections. Any changes in those areas would have to come from the central government, not the local level. The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, called on <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> today to release those who have been `` arbitrarily'' arrested in nationwide demonstrations and to end police actions against citizens trying to flee the nation. The European parliamentarians approved the criticism of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in a resolution unanimously adopted in <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> ZDF </ORGANIZATION> television network, the <ORGANIZATION> Hessische </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rundfunk </ORGANIZATION> radio in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> and the mass-circulation <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> newspaper speculated <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> will soon step down. `` As of Wednesday evening, a resignation could no longer be discounted,'' added the conservative Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung today. The East German sources said high-ranking <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> officials had demanded <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> deliver a report on the `` critical situation'' of the nation by Friday. In the past month, nearly 50,000 people have fled to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> and the country has seen its largest street protests since 1953. The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, reported resistance within the security forces and the state-controlled news media to the government's harsh weekend crackdown on nationwide pro-democracy protests. The Politburo, in its statement, reaffirmed its commitment to socialism, saying the answers to current problems `` are not to be found in the capitalist past.'' The Politburo hinted at possible changes including more free expression in the rigidly controlled news media and greater freedom to travel. Party sources said another Politburo member, <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON>, was responsible for the decision to order security forces _ who beat and arrested hundreds of protesters over the weekend _ to show restraint during demonstrations Monday in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION>.

 A magistrate today said white riot police had acted despicably and unlawfully in an attack on mixed-race demonstrators, but he acquitted their two commanding officers of assault charges. A mixed-race policeman who had accused the riot squad of acting like `` wild dogs'' called the verdict unbelievable. Magistrate <PERSON> A.S. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> said there was no evidence the major and lieutenant on the scene outside <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> on Sept. 5 witnessed the assaults and they could thus not be held responsible for the actions of their men. But <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> said the assaults in <LOCATION> Mitchell </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plain </LOCATION> township _ described by witnesses at the trial and shown in a subpoenaed videotape from <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> _ were illegal and despicable. In particular, he criticized the whipping of women on their breasts. The videotape was shown on government television Wednesday and today but edited to omit scenes showing police hitting people as they lay on the ground. `` The court is astonished that these members can not be identified by the police, or if they can be identified, that they are not in court,'' <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> said. The trial was prompted by allegations of mixed-race <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s Plain police officer Lt. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockman </PERSON>, who said the squad charged peaceful anti-election protesters with whips and clubs `` It is ridiculous what the outcome was,'' <PERSON> Rockman </PERSON> told reporters after learning the verdict. `` This means they can go around beating people. I do n't accept it.'' He said he would press for a meeting with President F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> to discuss his concerns about police violence. The demonstration ocurred the day before parliamentary elections, from which members of the country's 28 million black majority were excluded. <PERSON> Rockman </PERSON> testified that as he tried to get one riot squad away from the area to decrease tension, another one charged and attacked bystanders with glee. <PERSON> Rockman </PERSON> testified that Maj. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Brazelle </PERSON>, in charge of the riot squad, threatened to arrest him when he asked him to stop the attack. <PERSON> Brazelle </PERSON> was acquitted along with Lt. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Roos </PERSON>. The magistrate said national emergency regulations allow police to use violence to end illegal demonstrations and give immunity to the police if they act in good faith. The prosecution argued that the riot squad officers were not protected by the emergency regulations in this case because it was clear the demonstration, although illegal, posed no threat to public safety or the police.

 Two men were killed in clashes with authorities in a restive territory claimed by both the republics of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, a Soviet newspaper said today. The daily <ORGANIZATION> Komsomolskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Akonyan </PERSON> was killed late Tuesday in a clash between soldiers and local residents in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. R.E. <PERSON> Sadikov </PERSON> was killed Monday in the region, the report said. It quoted military officials as saying they had arrested <PERSON> Sadikov </PERSON> and confiscated a rifle from him but that he then attacked a soldier and was killed trying to escape. In both cases, soldiers were injured, said the report. On Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Arshenevsky </PERSON> announced that eight people were injured, two critically, when firefighters defended themselves against a crowd threatening them with stones and firearms. Armenian activists in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, the Armenian capital, said one person _ apparently <LOCATION> Akonyan </LOCATION> _ died in that clash. The bloody dispute over <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> has been going on 18 months.

 Here is a list of the 30 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members who voted one way in a vote on abortion restrictions on Sept. 9, 1988, and then voted the opposite way on a virtually identical proposal on Wednesday. In September 1988, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 216-166 to stick by its more restrictive provisions, limiting federal abortion aid to women whose lives are endangered. On Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 216-206 to abandon its own proposal, and instead adopt <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> language extending eligibility to women who have been victims of rape or incest and reported the incidents quickly to authorities. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> language that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> agreed to Wednesday included an unrelated provision restricting federal financing for programs that provide hypodermic needles to intravenous drug users. This provision received little mention in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> debate but could have influenced some votes. In all, 27 members voted for liberalized rules Wednesday who were recorded as voting against them in September 1988, while two voted against the eased limitations Wednesday who voted for them 13 months ago. The two voting for easing the limitations last year but switched to opposing them on Wednesday were Reps. <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Leath </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gekas </PERSON>, R-Pa.

 Voters are focusing more on the abortion issue this year, and some <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members say that is leading them to rethink the political wisdom of their past opinions. `` This year we're all listening,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Ravenel </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION>, as the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 216-206 on Wednesday to liberalize Medicaid abortion funding rules. He was one of 27 lawmakers who voted to allow more Medicaid-funded abortions on Wednesday but had voted the opposite last year. <PERSON> Ravenel </PERSON> attributed the change to increasing public awareness following the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s July decision giving the states more power to restrict abortions. `` There's been no time that the public awareness of this matter has been as high as it is now since I've been in public office,'' added Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-La </LOCATION>., another lawmaker who switched his vote over the last year `` They're perceiving their constituencies as pro-choice; obviously a majority of them are,'' Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., leader of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s anti-abortion forces, said of his colleagues after the vote `` Over the years, pro-lifers have been replaced by pro-choicers.'' Rep. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Boxer </PERSON>, D-Calif., who led the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> fight for the eased rules, was another who credited the climate created in the aftermath of the high court's July 3 ruling in the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> case, <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> vs Reproductive Health Services case. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> case made the issue real,'' she said. `` Before it was hypothetical because they always had the courts to rely on.'' In rejecting restrictions in place since 1981, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> agreed to allow federal aid for abortions for poor women who are victims of rape or incest. Conservatives lost an effort to reverse the vote, 212-207. Wednesday's votes reversed the chamber's 216-166 vote of Sept. 9, 1988, by which it decided to limit federal aid to cases where the woman's life was in danger. The bill now moves to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, which has already passed the eased limitations. However, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has threatened to veto the measure. There has been one other significant congressional victory for abortion rights forces since the <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> decision: the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s vote Aug. 2 to expand eligibility for government abortion aid in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> D.C </LOCATION>. But that vote was considered easier for lawmakers because it affected only abortions in the capital, and not their constituents back home. Wednesday's vote has sparked strong statements from both sides. `` The politicians who flip-flop on the abortion issue may find themselves in a political no-man's land, perceived as lacking principle and trusted by neither side,'' warned <PERSON> Darla </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, associate executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> to Life. Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> AuCoin </PERSON>, D-Ore., who backs abortion rights, said he believed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would veto the bill but predicted it would backfire `` I would tell him by doing it, you're going to bring injury upon yourself politically, but more important he's going to bring injury upon his allies in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. `` He wins in the short term _ the veto will stand obviously. But in the long term, politically he's going to lose.''

<HEAD>Defector Claims North Korea Planned To Bomb Seoul Olympics</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A North Korean defector claimed today that his country planned a series of bombing attacks at the 1988 Summer Olympics in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> but that the plan was canceled because of fear of retaliation. <PERSON> Suh </PERSON> <PERSON> Yong-chul </PERSON>, 26, who defected from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> last month, told a news conference that six members of his North Korean commando unit were trained to bomb Olympic facilities in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, including the 10,000-capacity main stadium. He said the plan was scrapped at the last moment because <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> leaders feared it could invite a retaliatory attack on a world youth festival scheduled in July. Both the Summer Olympics in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and the 13th World Youth Festival in <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, were held without disruption. `` Six members of our unit received special training to infiltrate during the Olympics, but the plan was canceled. I later knew that it was because the North feared that the South Korean side would retaliate against the youth festival,'' <PERSON> Suh </PERSON> said. He also said a 1983 explosion in the southeastern city of <LOCATION> Taegu </LOCATION> that killed four people was caused by a bomb planted by a North Korean agent, who was not captured. The North Korean agent, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Chul </PERSON>, was awarded a top government medal for the <LOCATION> Taegu </LOCATION> mission, he said. Four South Korean civilians were killed and two others wounded in an explosion in front of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cultural center in <LOCATION> Taegu </LOCATION> in September, 1983. No suspects were arrested but police announced at that time that the explosion was believed to be the work of North Korean agents. <PERSON> Suh </PERSON> defected to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> on Sept. 17 after swimming across a river that flows along the Demilitarized Zone separating the two Koreas. He said there are six units in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> trained in commando attacks on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. He claimed their main mission is to assassinate <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> leaders and sabotage government offices, airports and industrial facilities. <PERSON> Suh </PERSON> said each unit has about 200 members and is under direct control of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s ruling <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Suh </PERSON>'s said his unit was based in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s border city of <LOCATION> Kaesung </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>West German Party Asks to Join Legal Actions Against Atlantis Launch</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A West German political party is asking to join in legal actions to delay the launch of Atlantis, hoping to gain time to get the issue of the space shuttle's nuclear cargo before the world court. `` Because of the shortness of time, they asked that we represent them,'' said <PERSON> Lanny </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinkin </PERSON>, a lawyer for the <ORGANIZATION> Christic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> _ one of three environmental groups that on Tuesday lost an attempt to get a temporary restraining order against the launch. Atlantis is to be launched next week with the nuclear-powered <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> space probe in its cargo bay. After release from the shuttle, <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> is to embark on a six-year journey to the planet Jupiter. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> environmental groups had asked that the launch be halted on grounds that <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> had not fulfilled its environmental requirements and that an accident could poison the atmosphere with deadly plutonium-238. The petition by the <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, delivered to Sinkin in the midst of the hearing, cites possible violation of an international treaty. `` They were asking for a 10-day temporary restraining order so they could determine whether to go to the World Court, or whether to approach the <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> government to intervene formally,'' <PERSON> Sinkin </PERSON> said. He said it is his understanding that only a government can enforce a treaty. The <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is a political party focused on environmental issues and has some seats in the West German <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. `` Their claim is a violation of the outer space treaty signed in 1967 that both <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have ratified,'' <PERSON> Sinkin </PERSON> said. `` One provision says activities in space exploration by one country will not harm activities of another country. They are concerned about the potential for plutonium contamination of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.'' The signatories to the treaty also agreed not to introduce harmful contaminants into space and `` there is concern about the potential of introducing both plutonium and biological life into <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION>'s atmosphere because <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> is not sterilized,'' <PERSON> Sinkin </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> environmental groups have said they intend to carry their fight against the launch to higher courts, but no further legal actions had been filed. The newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> first reported the Germans' attempt to intervene. The motion to join in the suit was filed on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> by <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Lippelt </PERSON>, secretary to the lower house of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. `` As graphically demonstrated to the people of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> by the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> accident, such releases -LRB- of plutonium -RRB- can drastically affect people situated far from the site of the accident,'' the Greens' court motion says. `` The amount of plutonium on the Galileo mission exceeds the inventory of radioactivity in the Chernobyl reactor at the time of the accident,'' it said. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Frankle </PERSON> said the government will counter additional legal maneuvers. `` Any further attempts to get an injunction or change the current status, we will object to,'' he said.

<HEAD>Lawmaker Says Nothing Wrong in Investment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The senior Republican member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> says he sees nothing wrong in accepting a one-third interest in an investment venture funded by a businessman whose companies have done $ 50 million in government defense work since 1987. Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ala </LOCATION>., said Wednesday he approached <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, industrialist <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Collier </PERSON> in 1986 with `` what I thought was a good business opportunity'' and <PERSON> Collier </PERSON> agreed to put up $ 300,000 <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said he supplied the `` contacts'' for the <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> and the two men agreed that any profits or losses would be shared one-third by <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> and two-thirds by <PERSON> Collier </PERSON>. But the business opportunity soured when the $ 300,000 was turned over to <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Streit </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, whose claims of unusually high investment earnings had attracted some 300 investors. <PERSON> Streit </PERSON> eventually pleaded guilty to securities fraud and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. <PERSON> Streit </PERSON>'s assets were frozen in early 1987, and <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said the investment club has received about 90 percent of the $ 300,000 from a bankruptcy clerk that is serving <PERSON> Streit </PERSON>'s creditors. <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said he does not think his one-third interest in the investment club violates a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics rule that prohibits members from accepting gifts of more than $ 100 from any individual who has a direct interest in legislation before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` If he's got a direct interest in legislation I do n't know what it is,'' <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Collier </PERSON>. `` He's never asked me to vote any way, I do n't know of any legislation he's interested in and that's as far as it goes.'' He said he saw nothing `` illegal, immoral or unethical'' in the deal. <PERSON> Collier </PERSON> owns 45 percent of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apparel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which was formed in 1987 after <PERSON> Collier </PERSON> and several associates purchased the assets of the bankrupt <ORGANIZATION> Selma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apparel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The firm now has three plants in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, and according to <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cippele </PERSON>, a part owner of the company, has received $ 48.6 million in uniform contracts awarded by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Logistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> after competitive bidding. <PERSON> Collier </PERSON> also owns half interest in <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Microsystems </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> company that manufactures electronics components and test equipment for the aerospace, automobile and appliance industries. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Chesnutt </PERSON>, director of public affairs for <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Microsystems </ORGANIZATION>, said $ 3 million of the company's $ 9 million in total revenue this year came from subcontracts with two major defense contractors, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> Government Systems. <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said he has promoted <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Microsystems </ORGANIZATION> among defense contractors, just as he has promoted other businesses in his district that are interested in Pentagon work. But he said he had nothing to do with <PERSON> Collier </PERSON>'s purchase of the assets of <ORGANIZATION> Selma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apparel </ORGANIZATION>, or with the new company's subsequent approval by the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> as an acceptable bidder on defense contracts. Before <PERSON> Collier </PERSON> began negotiating to buy the bankrupt firm, <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said he signed a letter along with other members of the <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> delegation urging the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to save 600 <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> jobs by permiting <ORGANIZATION> Selma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apparel </ORGANIZATION> to resume bidding on defense contracts. The company had been barred from bidding after its owner, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Utsey </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, was convicted of federal bid-rigging charges. After <PERSON> Collier </PERSON> submitted his bid to bankruptcy court, lawmakers again urged the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to allow <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apparel </ORGANIZATION> to bid on government contracts. <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> was the only member of the <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> delegation who did not sign the letter, according to <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Braswell </PERSON>, an aide to Rep. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, who initiated the letter.

Rep. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Spratt </PERSON> and two other black Democrats are charged with extortion stemming from efforts by a former legislator to open a dog track. <PERSON> Spratt </PERSON> had subpoenaed the Republican governor, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s predecessor, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, to testify Oct. 20. <PERSON> Spratt </PERSON>'s attorney said he would show that black Democrats were singled out by white GOP prosecutors. But on Wednesday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> <PERSON> Hobbs </PERSON> granted a motion by <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>'s attorneys to quash the subpoena. The hearing was scheduled to consider <PERSON> Spratt </PERSON>'s request for dismissal of the charges based on racial discrimination. Hunt press secretary <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON> said the governor is `` just not involved'' in the case against <PERSON> Spratt </PERSON>. <PERSON> Spratt </PERSON> and Reps. <PERSON> Bobbie </PERSON> <PERSON> McDowell </PERSON> and E.B. <PERSON> McClain </PERSON> were indicted in connection with effort by former state Rep. <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Boles </PERSON> to open a pari-mutuel dog track at <LOCATION> Bessemer </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Spratt </PERSON> is accused of agreeing to support <PERSON> Boles </PERSON>' measure in the Legislature in return for a promise of stock options in the track. <PERSON> Boles </PERSON> was convicted in August of conspiracy and extortion. <PERSON> Spratt </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, had claimed that prosecutors ignored evidence of exortion and perjury by <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> during his tenure as state director of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Agricultural Stabilization and <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Hunt denied any wrongdoing while he held the federal job. He resigned the post in 1985 amid allegations he tried to use his office for political purposes and tried to impede the investigation. The investigation was later dropped.

 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is pressing an $ 837.5 million aid plan for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, nearly double the assistance proposed by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, to encourage those nations as they move toward democracy and free-market change. The committee endorsed the package 35-0 on Wednesday, choosing a middle road between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s $ 455.5 million proposal and the $ 1.2 billion urged by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats. The full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is expected to act on the three-year aid authorization measure next week. `` Success with our help is uncertain, but failure without our assistance is guaranteed,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, D-Ind., moments before the bill was approved Some Republican members said they were concerned the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill proposes too much spending and Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Broomfield </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Mich </LOCATION>., said a smaller amount is likely to emerge from the congressional appropriations process But most members said the legislation is an appropriate and urgently needed response to democratic and free-market movements in both <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. The House bill includes the $ 200 million to help <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> stabilize its currency which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed last week, a move many Democrats said was caused by congressional pressure to do more. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration took no position on the overall measure, which builds on and expands <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistance originally proposed by the president. The legislation would authorize spending $ 837.5 million to aid <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> over the next three years, including $ 284 million in the 1990 fiscal year which began on Oct. 1. The largest share of the money is earmarked for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s new non-communist government, which is beset with galloping inflation and other serious economic problems. The House bill would authorize $ 200 million to operate `` enterprise funds'' to speed economic change in the two countries. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has proposed spending $ 125 million for that purpose. The bill would boost the $ 100 million proposed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for food and livestock feed to a minimum of $ 125 million. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said the bill addresses an `` extraordinarily unique'' opportunity to wean Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> away from communism. `` This is an opportunity that may not come again for a long, long time and I think we should grab it and run,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagomarsino </PERSON>, R-Calif. <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Dante </PERSON> <PERSON> Fascell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., said the aid will `` lessen the impact of the instability which must take place when you think of the enormity of the changes'' <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> will have to make to transform their state-run `` I can only say that after four decades in which we spent literally trillions of dollars to prevent the communization of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, this is a relatively modest amount to spend to promote the unravelling of communism in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Safety Board Calls for Testing Safety of Small School Buses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal safety officials say small school buses lack standards that apply to larger buses and some have been modified in ways that increase the chance of injury in a crash. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, meeting late Wednesday, called for improved front door latches on all small school buses and government tests to further improve the safety of vehicles they say are already among the safest on the road. The board rejected earlier staff recommendations for full-scale crash tests but called for tests using computer simulation and crash sleds to determine the best design for barriers and seat belts in school buses that carry from 10 to 24 passengers. The nation's 41,000 small school buses do not have to meet federal standards set for larger buses, the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> staff noted. The board voted to call for installation of door latches that would prevent a bus's front door from popping open in a crash. It also urged federal testing of several possible improvements, including lap and shoulder belts in front seats, uniform barriers in front of the first seats and strengthened roofs and joints. `` In multivehicle crashes and other crash scenarios, small school buses lack the built-in crash advantage of superior size and weight provided by large school buses,'' the board concluded. But it also said investigation of 24 accidents involving the smaller buses showed that they `` generally provided good crash protection to both restrained and unrestrained passengers.'' Safety belts are required for passengers in small buses, but the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> staff said many students do not use them and lap-only belts in the front seat may add to the danger of injury in some crashes. The board two years ago recommended against seat belts in larger buses since seats must be designed to form a padded compartment around youthful riders. It said roofs in the smaller buses are less able to withstand rollover forces and body joints are exempt from federal joint strength standards that apply to larger buses. The board in August sent back the staff study for revisions after failing to resolve questions over front-seat barriers and use of seat belts in the buses. The staff proposed full-scale crash tests. But the four board members present at the meeting refused to adopt that recommendation. Sled-tests involve dummies on sliding devices that simulate conditions of a crash rather than the destruction of an actual school bus.

 The government announced the arrests of two suspected drug traffickers today and said it found 1,000 pounds of dynamite hidden at a residence of one of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s most powerful cocaine kingpins. An <ORGANIZATION> Administrative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said police have arrested reputed trafficker <PERSON> Leonidas </PERSON> <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON>. She said she had no information on the allegations against him or whether he is wanted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Espectador </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> ranks high in the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cocaine cartel and runs drug operations in the southern state of <LOCATION> Caqueta </LOCATION>, where in recent years police have raided several cocaine laboratories and seized tons of the drug. The paper said he was captured Wednesday at a ranch in the central state of <LOCATION> Tolima </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Administrative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, speaking on condition of anonymity, also said police arrested <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Houle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> and would deport him Friday to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Houle </PERSON> was a fugitive since his conviction on charges related to cocaine trafficking in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, the spokeswoman said. It was not known when he was captured or how long he had been at large. On Wednesday, the government announced two arrests of traffickers who were known to be wanted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> was arrested Wednesday and <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Abello </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> was captured Tuesday in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Abello </PERSON> directed the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel's operations on the country's <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> coast, the <ORGANIZATION> Administrative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. The office said in a communique that he had undergone facial surgery to avoid being recognized. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Harri </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> said a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, indicted <PERSON> Abello </PERSON> in 1987 on charges of conspiring to import and distribute cocaine. Palma is wanted by federal authorities in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on charges of interstate travel in aid of racketeering in connection with an operation to launder drug money, <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had requested that <PERSON> Abello </PERSON> and <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> be held for extradition. The army said today that it seized 1,000 pounds of dynamite at the home of <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez-Gacha </PERSON>, a powerful <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cocaine czar on the list of 12 Colombian drug barons most wanted by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The dynamite found Wednesday was in an underground storage area that had a concealed door in the ground, the army's 13th Brigade said in a communique. Six two-way portable radios, nine firearms and hundreds of pamphlets with threats against the government also were found, the army said. Since the drug traffickers and the governmment declared war on each other, 161 dynamite bombs have exploded in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s major cities, killing 11 people and injuring 183. On Wednesday, <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Espectador </PERSON> asked the government for protection following the assassination of two employees in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>. Traffickers claimed responsibility for Tuesday's killings and threatened to kill the paper's 11 remaining employees in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Espectador </PERSON> has been a strong supporter of the government's anti-drug campaign Its main offices were bombed last month and several of its employees have been killed, including the publisher. Also Wednesday, <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON>, the reputed head of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel, was quoted as saying in a letter that `` Colombian peace is more important than the considerations and conceptions of the other governments of the world.'' The letter asked the director of <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> daily, to intercede with the government and end its crackdown on drug gangs. The letter was read by the <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION> radio network. The letter said <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> and other papers should act `` for the sake of peace'' as go-betweens in negotiations between traffickers and the government of President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>. <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> has said he will never negotiate with the traffickers responsible for killing scores of the country's judges, journalists, political leaders and police. <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> heads the list of the 12 Colombian drug suspects most wanted for extradition to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. None has been apprehended. The main weapon in the government crackdown has been a promise to extradite those wanted on drug charges in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 A terminally ill <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> employee whose request for an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> air ambulance ride home to <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> was denied has died, his doctor said today. <PERSON> Avram </PERSON> <PERSON> Brody </PERSON> had sought an airlift from <LOCATION> Palmdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, to his family home in <LOCATION> Norwood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, so he could be with family members when he died. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> refused, saying <PERSON> Brody </PERSON> did not meet criteria for such help because he was not a uniformed officer, the flight was not needed to save his life and his illness was not caused by his work. Dr. <PERSON> Abdallah </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrukh </PERSON>, who attended <PERSON> Brody </PERSON> over the past several weeks, said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Antelope </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, that <PERSON> Brody </PERSON>, 25, died Wednesday night of a brain tumor in his <LOCATION> Palmdale </LOCATION> home. There was no anwer this morning at <PERSON> Brody </PERSON>'s home where his wife, <PERSON> Amy </PERSON>, and a nurse have been attending him for the past several weeks. The <PERSON> Brody </PERSON> family enlisted the help of several <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> representatives along with Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, D-Mass., and <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Card </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> native But the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> position remained unchanged. Another who worked on the case was <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Office of Handicapped Affairs. `` This one's a real sadness for the family. It's a heartbreaking time,'' <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON> said today. `` I'm going to wonder probably for the rest of my life if we did n't do too little, too late on this one. I wish we could have gotten them home.'' <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON> said of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> position, `` I think that their regulations ignored a very sad and simple reality.'' Following publicity about the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> refusal to provide an air ambulance, several private companies and individuals offered to provide a ride for free. But by then <PERSON> Brody </PERSON>'s condition had deteriorated to the point where he could no longer be moved.

 Abortion rights leaders claim an `` unprecedented turnaround'' is putting anti-abortion forces on the political run following defeats in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and a special legislative session in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. And in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, Democratic candidate for governor <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> is challenging political wisdom on abortion by airing pro-choice television ads aimed at winning support among conservative voters. `` This is evidence that the anti-choice minority no longer inspires fear in elected officials,'' said <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelman </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abortion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. Leaders of the national abortion rights group today unveiled new TV and newspaper ads they are airing in the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> governor's race attacking the anti-abortion <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nominee and said they planned extensive campaigns next year in races nationwide `` We are building a strength in the states that, if we need one, we can pass a constitutional amendment'' to protect abortion rights, <PERSON> Michelman </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 216-206 on Wednesday to allow federal aid for abortions for poor women who are victims of rape or incest, rejecting Medicaid restrictions it has kept in the law since 1981. It instead backed more liberal provisions already passed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The vote was a defeat for conservatives and put <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in opposition to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has promised to veto Medicaid abortions. Rep. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, D-Colo., attributed the vote to an abortion rights movement galvanized by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s decision in July giving the states more power to restrict abortions `` The <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> decision was a wakeup call,'' she said. Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>, R-Ill., for years the leader of anti-abortion forces in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members are increasingly `` perceiving their constituencies as pro-choice. <PERSON> Darla </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the vote `` opens the door to the use of tax funds to destroy innocent unborn babies'' and vowed that members who switched on the issue `` will now hear from constituents.'' In <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, a special session of the state legislature called by Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> rejected a series of proposed restrictions on abortions that the Republican governor sought. `` A right, having been established, is not easily removed,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s speaker of the House. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, appearing on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America'' program, insisted today that most Floridians wanted certain restrictions on abortions but that a handful of state legislators kept colleagues from voting on measures he had proposed. `` They were rejected by killer committees. They did n't get to the floor, unlike the action taken by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> session was the first in the nation since the July 3 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling gave the longstanding debate over abortion a fresh and relevant political focus. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> was closely watched as a bellwether for the nation, and more than 10,000 demonstrators had descended upon its capital. In <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, idependent polls show Democratic gubernatorial candidate <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> overtaking his anti-abortion opponent since he began airing a tough ad accusing Republican <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> of trying to take away women's right to a legal abortion, even in cases of rape and incest. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> of trying `` to spread fear _ fear from a single, divisive issue.'' The election is in four weeks. <PERSON> Michelman </PERSON>, head of the national abortion rights group, said the votes in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` are overwhelming evidence of the dramatic and unprecedented turnaround among elected officials on this issue.'' She credited abortion rights demonstrators and dismissed the anti-abortion forces as `` a small minority whose electoral bite does not match their bark.'' Supporters of expanded abortion rights argued the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling in the <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> case mobilized their side by making the possibility of new abortion restrictions seem more likely _ and in the process prompted some abortion supporters to become single-issue voters, just as some abortion opponents have been. The provision adopted by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would allow Medicaid payments for abortions when the mother's life is in jeopardy or when the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest _ and was `` promptly'' reported to authorities. Since 1981 the House has voted for language allowing federal aid for abortions only in cases in which the woman's life was in danger. Medicaid financing for poor women's abortions has been restricted in one way or another since 1977. The abortion provision is part of a $ 156.7 billion measure to finance labor, health and education programs for fiscal 1990, which began Oct. 1. The spending bill, which was approved 364-56, now moves to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> threatened in August to veto the bill if it contains the more liberal abortion language, and administration officials reiterated that threat this week. Though the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote was too narrow to override a veto, supporters of broader abortion rights said changing public views in the wake of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling have given their side the momentum. `` The political momentum on this issue is so strong now that if President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vetoes this, he'd be making a big mistake,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Boxer </PERSON>, D-Calif. `` <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> has changed the entire political equation,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> AuCoin </PERSON>, D-Ore., who voted to broaden the abortion `` <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> sent a signal to the country, particularly women, that the courts are n't there, that they'll have to rely on the political arena.''

 Panamanian officers who led last week's abortive coup were recruited and paid more than $ 1 million by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> charged in an interview published today <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> also claimed that Nicaraguan Contras and Panamanian businessmen delivered money and relayed messages between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials and coup plotters, the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> reported. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was involved before, during and after the coup,'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said in a joint interview. `` They had to make the contacts, woo them, convince them. It's a lot of work before you've hooked the fish But they were the hook and the useful fools were the fish.'' `` The Contras put them in contact with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said of the coup leaders. The military ruler said that forces loyal to him detained 77 rebel soldiers after the attempted coup. Previous reports said 37 soldiers were arrested. The two reporters conducting the interview received stern warnings from a Noriega aide to avoid questioning <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> about allegations that 10 of those arrested have been executed, the Times said. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION>, said that he had crushed two plots from within the defense forces, the second being planned under the direction of Col. <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Wong </PERSON>, chief of intelligence and a member of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s general staff. He said that on the day of the coup, <PERSON> Wong </PERSON> received several long-distance calls from an unidentified <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military officer in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. He said <PERSON> Wong </PERSON> is under arrest. He also there was no truth to reports he had been detained during the coup attempt. `` I dominated the situation totally,'' he said. `` When I started to talk with them, it was all over.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, speaking in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, accused <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s senior director of <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> affairs, of involvement in the failed coup. <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON>, who has served as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, where the Contras were based, was linked to the coup because he visited <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> shortly before the uprising, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said. There was no comment from <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON> or any <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> official in the newspaper reports. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said his investigators discovered the existence of a bank account containing more than $ 1 million in the name of Capt. <PERSON> Erick </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murillo </PERSON>, one of the alleged coup leaders. `` There was a lot of money there for a normal Panamanian. Six zeroes. It was a million-dollar account,'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said. He claimed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials gave <PERSON> Murillo </PERSON> the money for bribes, but would not identify the bank holding the alleged account. <PERSON> Murillo </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>' elite Battalion 2000, was one of 10 officers the government said was killed during the uprising. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said one of the detained soldiers was found with $ 700,000 in cash, allegedly used to bribe rank-and-file soldiers.

 A lawyers' organization and two consumer groups want the government to investigate a household drain cleaner they contend poses a risk of explosions that can cause serious injury. But the manufacturer says the product is `` safe and effective when used in accordance with label instructions'' and accused the attorneys of trying to drum up business. `` On any given occasion, using -LRB- the product -RRB- is akin to playing Russian roulette,'' wrote <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> <PERSON> Herman </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION>, in an Oct. 5 letter to the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Product </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. `` Even by explicitly following the product instructions, consumers may experience the risk of sudden, violent explosion with tragic consequences to their health and safety,'' <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> said. The name of the product is blacked out in a copy of the letter obtained by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. A source familiar with the letter, speaking on condition of anonymity, identified the product as <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Devil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lye </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Rhonda </PERSON> <PERSON> Askew </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> woman who is disfigured and partially blind, told a news conference today she was injured when a tablespoon of the drain cleaner `` blew back on me'' as she used it to clear a clogged bathroom sink. `` I could see it coming but I could n't get away from it,'' said <PERSON> Askew </PERSON>. `` I do n't know what it feels like to be happy. ... I do n't know joy,'' she said, describing how she has had 10 operations since the incident. The lawyers association first contacted the commission about potential dangers associated with the product in August. Two consumer advocacy groups, the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION>, also are seeking an investigation. <PERSON> Red </PERSON> <PERSON> Devil </PERSON> <PERSON> Lye </PERSON> is a crsytalline drain cleaner manufactured and distributed by a New York-based company, <ORGANIZATION> Boyle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Midway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Household </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` We have made repeated attempts to produce the ` explosive' effect described by <ORGANIZATION> ATLA </ORGANIZATION> using the product according to label directions and have never seen such results,'' said <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Host </PERSON>, president of <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Midway </PERSON>, in a written statement released Wednesday `` <ORGANIZATION> ATLA </ORGANIZATION> is engaged in a transparent effort to promote the economic interests of its members by this blatant client-soliciting effort,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Host </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> ATLA </ORGANIZATION> is a 65,000-member organization of attorneys who frequently represent plaintiffs in personal injury cases. <ORGANIZATION> ATLA </ORGANIZATION> said it found 21 instances when the lye `` exploded from drain pipes and injured users or bystanders.'' In addition, there were reported incidents of `` ingestion by small children, with catastrophic results,'' the letter said. `` The risk of blindness or permanent eye impairment is high; severe alkaline burns to the face, arms and hands also are likely,'' <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> said. `` We are convinced that this product, which is intended to deal with a difficult household problem, is safe and effective when used in accordance with label instructions,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Host </ORGANIZATION>. `` Any assertion that the product can not be used safely by the consumer is wholly unwarranted,'' <ORGANIZATION> Host </ORGANIZATION> added, noting the company warns on the label that lye is a dangerous product on the label. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Smeltzer </PERSON>, head of the safety commission's compliance division, said the commission had done preliminary investigations of two companies that make crystalline lye. He said it revealed more instances of explosions with liquid sulfuric acid drain cleaners than with sodium hydroxide cleaners such as <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Devil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lye </ORGANIZATION>. `` If appropriate, we'll try to take some other action,'' he said. The company said it was cooperating with the commission. Red Devil sales reached about $ 6 million in 1988 for a 6 percent share of the drain cleaner market, the company said.

 <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> made millions of dollars from his investment in a lab that made steroids for the black market, authorities said. Milano Laboratories of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Tijuana </LOCATION>'s border industrial zone, was shut down by police in April. At the time, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities said it was the largest supplier of steroids to a multimillion-dollar <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> black market. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> invested $ 800,000 two years ago in the lab, and his return of about $ 2 million was put back into the company several times, said <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON>, commander of the federal judicial police in <LOCATION> Tijuana </LOCATION>. `` We are still working to see exactly how much money was involved, but it was many millions of dollars,'' <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON> said Wednesday. <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON> said the lab was shut down because of false labeling. He said agents found a warehouse full of steroids, antibiotics and vitamins along with boxes of labels claiming the drugs were made by pharmaceutical companies in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. Agents also found business documents signed by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Milano </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Macklis </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercado </PERSON> was arrested in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s airport Monday when he arrived in disguise from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, authorities said. He was charged with evading taxes of about $ 500,000. Many other suspects are thought to be living in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, probably in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, authorities said. Manufacturing anabolic steroids is legal in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, where the muscle-building drug is sold over the counter, but they are legally obtainable in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by prescription only. Studies have shown that long-term use can cause heart disease, liver failure and other maladies.

 <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> will not be allowed back into the Group of Eight organization of Latin American nations until democracy is restored there, President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> said today. His announcement came a day after the presidents of <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> broke with tradition at the regional summit and denounced <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s government, which Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> effectively heads, as a dictatorship. The summit ends tonight. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> told a news conference that a document released at the end of the meeting will outline the decision to continue <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s exclusion from the organization The Central American country was suspended last year after <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> engineered the removal of civilian President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> after <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> tried to fire him. The final document also will include full backing for the struggle of the coca-producing Andean nations against the region's cocaine traffickers, <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> said One of the principal points the presidents agreed on was an `` all-out war against drug trafficking and terrorism until they are liquidated,'' he told reporters. The leaders met under heavy security at the plush Hotel Las Dunas on the outskirts of <ORGANIZATION> Ica </ORGANIZATION>, a city of 350,000 people in the desert 180 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. In opening statements Wednesday, President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> said <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s military government is a `` masked dictatorship.'' The comment came one day after he accused <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> Defense Forces of murder in snuffing out a coup attempt Oct. 3 <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, host of the meeting, used his opening remarks to `` express publicly the Peruvian people's and the Peruvian government's repudiation and condemnation of the military dictatorship'' in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Their condemnations broke with the traditional reluctance of Group of Eight nations to publicly denounce a member at such meetings. The summit began a day after <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON> agreed to invite President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to a drug summit in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that would take place within 90 days. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> accepted immediately. The three Andean nations are the source of nearly all of the world's cocaine. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> and the other presidents made clear Wednesday they did not share <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s focus on police action as the best way to fight the drug trade. `` The more demand grows in the North, the more production will grow in the South. Police actions will be useless unless demand is reduced,'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said. `` The problem is not only in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>,'' said President <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanguinetti </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>, referring to the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> city that is home to the world's largest cocaine cartel. `` It is also in the streets of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.'' The <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel has virtually been at war with the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government since suspected drug assassins killed the country's leading presidential candidate Aug. 18 <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sanguinetti </PERSON>, <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> and presidents <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> took part in the third summit of the Group of Eight, which was founded in 1987.

That was the last the other hunters saw of him.

<TEXT>
 The City Opera, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s No. 2 company behind the Metropolitan, canceled its fall season today and threatened to scratch its spring program unless its striking musicians agree to a contract by next month. The 69-member musicians union has been without a contract since June 1 and struck on Sept. 13, opening night of the fall season. On Saturday, the union voted 56-4 to reject a pact, and the opera said at the time that the season, scheduled to end Nov. 19, would be canceled if the orchestra members did not return. `` Obviously, we are extremely saddened by this development because it puts out of work hundreds of innocent people who rely on these jobs for their livelihood and whose representatives have urgently requested these parties to avoid this result,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Oppenheimer </PERSON>, the company's vice chairman and lead negotiator, said today. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glasel </PERSON>, president of the union local, said that the cancellation is regrettable and that the opera management's deadline for reaching a contract `` exemplifies the Neanderthal negotiating style of the company. The opera and its musicians have been divided over wages and the number of work weeks that orchestra members are guaranteed annually. Musicians earned $ 755 a week under the old contract. Established in 1943, the non-profit City Opera stages a Broadway musical revival in the spring and begins its summer opera season in July.

<TEXT>
 The memoirs of the man who marched beside the Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> depict him as a leader of outstanding moral character but who had a weakness for women, even on the night before his assassination. `` And The Walls Came Tumbling Down,'' published this month by <ORGANIZATION> Harper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Row, chronicles the Rev. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON>'s life as a preacher and civil rights activist, including his many years as <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s closest friend and confidant. <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> reveals that King had encounters with various women on the night before his April 4, 1968, assassination at a <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, hotel. The revelation corroborates longstanding reports that King had extramarital affairs. But in an advance copy of the book, <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> staunchly defends his friend's morality, without condoning his activities. He explains that he felt compelled to write of `` my friend's weakness for women,'' and devotes part of one chapter in the 610-page book to King's private affairs. King `` believed in the biblical prohibition against sex outside of marriage. It was just that he had a particularly difficult time with that temptation,'' <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> wrote. `` We all fall short of the mark. ... Sexual sins are by no means the worst. Hatred and a cold disregard for others are the besetting sins of our time.'' <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> said he might have avoided the matter had others not dealt with it in detail. He said he wanted `` to make some attempt to render justice to the dead without causing too much unnecessary pain to the living.'' <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> names none of the women with whom King allegedly was involved. He said extended travels during the civil rights movement were one reason, but not the main one, for King's extramarital liaisons. `` He was ... a man who attracted women, even when he did n't intend to, and attracted them in droves,'' <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> said `` He was a hero _ the greatest hero of his age _ and women are always attracted to a hero.'' <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> praised his friend for courage, saying had King `` been a coward rather than a truly brave man ... we might still be riding in the back of buses and eating in segregated restaurants.'' He also said he felt other King aides saw him as `` no more than an appendage to <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, someone who served as a part companion, part bodyguard, but who never played an important role in the decisions that affected the direction of the movement.'' <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> said those people did not realize how much King depended on him for advice and counsel outside the limelight. Detailing the night before <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s assassination, <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> wrote that after <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s `` I have been to the mountaintop'' address, King, <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> and a colleague went to the home of `` a ` friend' of <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s.'' <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> saw King and the friend come out of the bedroom after 1 a.m., according to the book's advance copy. Later that night, back at the <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> <PERSON> Motel </PERSON>, King got together with `` a black woman ... a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>'' with whom he shared a `` close'' relationship, <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> wrote. He added that King did not return to the room he shared with <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> until after 7 a.m.. That morning, King asked <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> to mediate a dispute between King and a third woman _ `` another young woman <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> knew well'' _ who apparently had come looking for King in the middle of the night and could n't find him In an ensuing argument, King shouted at the woman and `` knocked her across the bed,'' <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> wrote. The <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> had two black women members in 1968, Sen. <PERSON> Georgia </PERSON> <PERSON> Powers </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Mae </PERSON> <PERSON> Street </PERSON> <PERSON> Kidd </PERSON>, Democrats from <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>. Powers, who participated in civil rights demonstrations with <PERSON> King </PERSON>, was at the <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> <PERSON> Motel </PERSON> the night of his assassination. On Wednesday she said she had not read the book and was advised by her lawyer not to comment until she had. She did not immediately return a call to her home today. <PERSON> Kidd </PERSON>, who also is no longer in the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> King </PERSON> was `` a great man ... but he was not a personal friend of mine. I did not participate in any of the marches, nor was I in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, at the time he was there.'' <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> also wrote he saw no evidence that King was disturbed by <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> audio tapes of one of his sexual encounters or the knowledge that <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents were spreading tales about his activity. `` In fact, he seemed less concerned about public exposure than I was,'' <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> wrote. `` At that particular time, he was bearing a lion's share of the burden and he felt he could n't do so without this source of strength.'' <PERSON> Stoney </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a spokesman at the Martin Luther King Jr.. Center for Nonviolent Social Change in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, said he believed King's widow, <PERSON> Coretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, and other family members had not yet read <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON>'s A call to Mrs. <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s office at the center was not immediately returned.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>'s flat-out rejection of new abortion curbs may give women their best political springboard since the'60s, feminists say. But anti-abortion activists say they, too, will be galvanized. `` It has fanned the fire,'' said <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Right to Life President <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Connor </PERSON>. `` It's one thing to disappoint people. It's another thing to slap them in the face. That's what the Legislature has done.'' In the nation's first major attempt to take advantage of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling in July allowing new curbs on abortion, the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> adjourned Wednesday without passing any of the measures pushed by Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>. `` <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> has just sent a message to the nation,'' said <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Smeal </PERSON>, president of the Fund for a <ORGANIZATION> Feminist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Majority </ORGANIZATION> and a former president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION>. More than 10,000 demonstrators descended upon <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s capital as the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> shot down 14 proposals to curb abortion. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, appearing on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America,'' insisted today that most Floridians wanted certain restrictions on abortions but that a handful of legislators kept colleagues from voting on measures he had proposed. `` They were rejected by killer committees. They did n't get to the floor, unlike the action taken by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. The proposals would have banned use of public funds for abortions, required a husband's consent, made women wait a week and undergo counseling before the operation, created a statewide center to promote adoption and required viability tests of the fetus if a woman was believed to be 20 weeks pregnant. Other measures killed would have toughened clinic regulations, an idea lawmakers had given the best chance of approval after three south <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> clinics were closed by the state for unsanitary and unsafe conditions. The defeat had been predicted by <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders who said the first-term <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> governor knew it would happen. `` He wasted taxpayers' money to make a political statement that he felt was going to help him,'' said Democratic state Chairman <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferro </PERSON>. `` We ought to be embarrassed that the governor put us through this whole fiasco.'' Opponents said the special session, which began Tuesday, cost more than $ 145,000. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, who faces re-election in 1990, conceded his initiative had faltered badly. `` I do n't think it's a moment for rejoicing,'' said <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>. `` If anything, it's a moment of sadness.'' But <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kropp </PERSON>, president of People for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Way </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, a liberal political group, said the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>'s actions would make politicians across the country pay attention to their constituents `` Today's victory will be a rude wake-up call for politicians hoping to score points at the polls by rolling back reproductive freedom,'' <PERSON> Kropp </PERSON> said. `` Legislators in other states should take heed: Pro-choice politics is winning politics, even in conservative states.'' <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ireland </PERSON>, vice president of NOW, said the whole exercise had the possibly unintended result of energizing younger, previously apathetic women to fight for their rights. `` This is creating a new wave of feminism that we have not had since the 1960s,'' <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> said. `` This is one of those junctures where the political climate has clearly changed.'' <PERSON> Smeal </PERSON> said abortion rights' organizations hoped to turn the new interest into political gains by recruiting more women to run for national, state and local office. State Rep. <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, a leader of the abortion-rights forces in the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, said the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> experience can serve as a blueprint elsewhere. `` I think that it encourages pro-choice movements in other states,'' she said. `` We will be able to provide them the incentive and the encouragement.'' Anti-abortion activist <PERSON> Carole </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> had similar thoughts. `` Our people are angry at what we've seen,'' she said. `` We are preparing for the 1990 elections, and now we know more of our targets.'' For his part, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Right to Life's <PERSON> Connor </PERSON> said: `` What's next is we go back to work. We field new candidates who affirm the sanctity and dignity of human life. We explore the potential for a constitutional amendment.''

<HEAD>Beijing Party Chief Steps Up Attack on Political Reforms</HEAD>

 The hard-line <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> intensified the assault on political reforms with a call for direct party decision-making in universities and local government, reports said Thursday. Political principles should be the key factor in making decisions, the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Daily quoted the city's party secretary, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Ximing </PERSON>, as telling a local committee meeting. Party branches also should be involved in all decisions in factories, even such small matters as firing and allocating staff, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said. It was the second attack in as many days in the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Daily </LOCATION> on the political reform program endorsed by the party in 1987 that called for separating the functions of the ruling party and government, and reducing interference of party officials in business and other non-party matters. A major commentary in the paper Wednesday charged that such separation weakened the party, and blamed the reform program on ousted party General Secretary <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> even though it originally was backed by senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>. The Communist Party long has maintained a shadow bureaucracy in government and business, with party officials supervising and frequently taking charge of all decisions. In the reform atmosphere of the past decade, however, excessive party inteference was condemned and the power of party branches were weakened in many units. In a major speech endorsed by the party in 1987, <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> said separating party and government roles and letting factory managers take charge of production was essential for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s development. But since <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>'s ouster in June for allegedly supporting massive pro-democracy protests, strengthening the party has become the leadership's No. 1 goal. The <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Daily quoted <PERSON> Li </PERSON> as saying the party must `` bring into full play the powerful fighting force of the party branches.'' `` In universities ... street party committees that function as district organs and party committees at village level and below, the party will not participate in decision making but make the decisions,'' he said. Street committees and village committees are the most basic level of local government, and have wide powers over job and housing assignments. Enterprise managers should get agreement of party officials before hiring or firing personnel, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> added. `` In dismissing -LRB- enterprise -RRB- officials the party organization should act based on political ideology, but should fully respect the administrative leaders' views regarding ability.'' `` Organizations at all levels of a ruling party must shoulder the responsibility of managing -LRB- non-party -RRB- officials,'' he said. He also called for closer party involvement in the work of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s many `` mass organizations,'' including labor unions and women's assocations, `` so that they can follow the right political direction.''

 A slender burglar tried to slide into a restaurant through its rooftop ventilation system and got so hung up on protruding screws that he had to scream for help, police said. `` He was scuffling up there trying to get out, cussing and carrying on,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Potter </PERSON>, manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Horn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Horn Smorgasboard.

 Northwest must show that <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> knowingly sold it a defective plane if the airline is to collect damages from the manufacturer in a jet crash that killed 156 people, a federal judge ruled. The ruling Wednesday by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> limits the airline's ability to collect from the maker of the MD-80 that crashed in 1987 on takeoff from <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> Metropolitan Airport. Only <PERSON> Cecelia </PERSON> <PERSON> Cichan </PERSON>, then 4, survived. <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> is presiding over the trial on a lawsuit by relatives of crash victims that will determine who was at fault in the crash. Jury selection began Oct. 2 and continued today. Northwest has claimed the plane had a faulty circuit breaker and warning system that failed to warn the crew that the flaps had not been set for takeoff. <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> has denied any problem with the plane. The judge sided with the company's argument that the purchase agreement for the $ 15 million aircraft absolved the maker of liability unless <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> could prove the knowing sale of a defective product. Attorneys involved would n't comment. <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> has issued a gag order for the duration of the trial.

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zemin </PERSON>, a technocrat plucked from relative obscurity to head the world's largest <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, is being remolded by party propagandists into a brilliant leader and man of the masses. The glorification of the 63-year-old former mayor and party boss of <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> follows <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>'s decision to make <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> his successor as <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s top leader. Some Chinese and foreign observers compare the laurels being heaped on <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> to the treatment given <PERSON> Hua </PERSON> <PERSON> Guofeng </PERSON> after a dying <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON> purportedly told him in 1976: `` With you in charge, I'm at ease.'' <PERSON> Hua </PERSON>, like <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> a local administrator untested in national politics, was hailed as <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s `` wise leader'' until <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> consolidated power in the late 1970s and <PERSON> Hua </PERSON> was unceremoniously consigned to political oblivion. <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> was the surprise choice to head the 48 million-member <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> after the faction-riven party on June 24 ousted <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, a relative reformist accused of aiding the pro-democracy student movement crushed earlier that month. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> was believed to have picked <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> because he supported <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s open-door policies while being ready to comply with the party hard-liners' tough crackdown on domestic dissent. Despite the nature of his rise to power, the party has worked hard to dispel the impression of dissension in the ranks by declaring national unity behind <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON>'s astute leadership. The party Propaganda Department on Sept. 30 called on all Chinese to study <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON>'s address to mark the 40th anniversary of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> rule on Oct. 1, saying it will have `` an important bearing on the unity of the whole party, the whole army and people of all nationalities.'' The turgid 80-minute address summed up the party's stance on the correctness of crushing the pro-democracy movement, or `` counterrevolutionary rebellion,'' the supremacy of socialism and the inviolability of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> rule. Since then, official newspapers and television news programs have been filled with reports of schools, factories and local party groups meeting to read and discuss <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON>'s speech. The words of praise are universal and remarkably similar. <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Baibing </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, said the speech is the `` crystallization of the collective wisdom of the party Central Committee.'' Party members in <LOCATION> Hubei </LOCATION> province said <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON>'s words `` embody the firmness, clarity and continuity of the party's theory and line.'' <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, 85, and reportedly in failing health, is said to have anointed <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> in a closed-door speech this June by referring to him as the `` core of the new leadership.'' Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>, a likely rival in any future power struggle, chimed in last week by telling foreign businessmen that <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> had `` rich experience in political and economic work'' and `` we support him as the core of our leadership.'' Government spokesman <PERSON> Yuan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mu </PERSON>, in a commentary in the party's official <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> this week, also confirmed the `` third generation'' of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leadership was firmly in control, with <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> as `` the core. <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON>, a cosmopolitan man who speaks varying degrees of English, Japanese and <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> and appears at ease in Western attire with Western businessmen, is also being remade into a folksy, Mao-suited man of the masses. On National Day, Oct. 1, <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> made a `` surprise'' stop at the Fuxingmen intersection, scene of many deaths during the June 3-4 military attack on dissidents in the city, to chat with the people. Much like Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s flesh-pressing tours, <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> chatted with soldiers and children, congratulated newlyweds, posed for pictures and, as he left, shouted: `` Comrades, see you again. Let us work with one heart to build up the country.'' The People's Daily in August pictured <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON>, in shirtsleeves, sharing a factory cafeteria meal with a worker, and reported that while touring a <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> steel factory he led the workers in the song `` We Workers Have Strength.'' When a worker at a textile factory showed reluctance to shake with his oil-covered hand, <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> grabbed his hand and said: `` Never mind. From now on we must rely on you'' workers. Since taking office <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> has traveled to <LOCATION> Yenan </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s former revolutionary base in dusty northwestern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and talked with farmers in rural <LOCATION> Hubei </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Shaanxi </LOCATION> provinces <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON>'s square, black-rimmed glasses, gray hair and ready smile have helped convey an avuncular image, and, when the occasion calls for it, he has shown a knack for appearing broad-minded. In a meeting with students who had returned from abroad, <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> said it was understandable that some Chinese students overseas were misled by the Western press and engaged in pro-democracy protests. Those who correct their mistakes will be welcomed back, he said _ `` Men are not saints, so how can they be free from faults?'' Yet when asked at a recent news conference about the crackdown on the protesters, which followed weeks of protests in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, smiles were quickly replaced with a sharply worded recitation of the party's uncompromising stance The military suppression of the student movement during which hundreds, perhaps thousands, were killed `` was not a tragedy,'' <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> said. `` Tiananmen was a counterrevolutionary rebellion opposing the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders and seeking to overthrow the socialist system,'' he said.

<HEAD>Fight Breaks Out in Front of Pope's Altar</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER O'LOUGHLIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DILI, Indonesia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A melee of flying chairs and swinging sticks broke out in front of the altar Thursday as Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> was finishing his blessing to a crowd of 100,000 in <LOCATION> Dili </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Timor </LOCATION>. Four women were reported hospitalized with injuries suffered after being crushed in the surging crowd during the battle between plainclothes police and chanting youths who oppose Indonesian control of the former <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> colony. No arrests were reported and the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> did not appear to be in danger at any time. The trouble began when about 20 young men shouting `` Viva independence!'' and `` Viva il papa!'' unfurled a banner in front of the altar and hurled chairs at policemen. Plainclothesmen flogged the youths and seized their banner. The crowd scattered and about 100 more young man joined the fray. Police confiscated the film of some photographers after the fighting ended about 15 minutes later. One banners read, in Portuguese, `` Fretilin Welcomes You.'' Another said: `` <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, Savior of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Timor </LOCATION>.'' Fretilin is the independence movement that has fought <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> rule since annexation in 1976. A non-Indonesian priest said it was clear the protesters respected the pope because they did not act until the Mass was over. In a similar incident in April 1987, leftists opposed to the Chilean government threw rocks at police during a papal Mass in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>. Security forces responded with tear gas, some of which wafted toward the alter. On Thursday, white-cassocked priests and seminarians moved quickly to calm the crowd and the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> was escorted to his car, surrounded by <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> security men. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> is on a 10-day tour of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mauritius </LOCATION>. During four days in <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, the pontiff has urged the government of the world's most populous Moslem nation to protect human rights in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Timor </LOCATION>. The local Roman Catholic church and the human rights group <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> say violations include mass arrests, torture and `` disappearances.'' The protesters, supporters of Fretilin, got to within 100 feet of the steps of the altar, where the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> watched in sweltering heat that reached 100 degrees. Girl Scouts, who had acted as ushers in front of the altar, wept as they were caught up in the melee. In his homily, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> made no direct mention of <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> rule over <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Timor </LOCATION>, which neither the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> nor <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> recognizes, but referred instead to `` those who have responsibility for life in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Timor </LOCATION>.'' `` Respect for the rights which render life more human must be firmly ensured: the rights of individuals and the rights of families,'' he declared. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> urged <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> to `` act with wisdom and good will toward all'' in the search for a peaceful solution to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Timor </LOCATION>'s problems On his arrival from the island of <PERSON> Flores </PERSON>, the pope did not kiss the ground, a gesture that would have been viewed as acknowledging <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Timor </LOCATION> was a separate country. He did kneel and kiss a crucifix lying on a pillow on the ground beneath the altar, however, and the crowd applauded. A <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> spokesman called that a `` purely pastoral'' gesture, meaning it had no political significance. Monsignor <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Belo </PERSON>, bishop of <LOCATION> Dili </LOCATION>, told reporters the Mass site had been the scene of killings by the <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> military, which used it as an interrogation center at the height of the rebellion after annexation. <PERSON> Belo </PERSON>, an outspoken prelate who has proposed a referendum to determine the island's political future, said the ground would be `` sanctified'' by the papal Mass. The pontiff said the East Timorese had `` experienced destruction and death as a result of conflict.'' `` You have known what it means to be victims of hatred and struggle,'' he said. `` Many innocent people have died while others have been prey to retaliation and revenge. For too long, you have been suffering a lack of stability which had rendered your future uncertain.'' A military garrison officially estimated at 13,000 is stationed in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Timor </LOCATION>. The army admits to thousands of casualties in guerrilla warfare since annexation, but claims only about 200 guerrillas now operate in the hinterland. <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> has 157 Moslems and only 5 million Catholics, but 80 percent of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Timor </LOCATION>'s 590,000 people are <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> landing craft transported thousands of Catholic villagers to <LOCATION> Dili </LOCATION>, but the turnout was far lower than expected. Foreign priests said people feared the roadblocks set up for identity checks about every 12 miles.

 A terminally ill <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> employee whose request to be flown to his <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> home on an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> plane was turned down has died, his doctor said Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said last month that <PERSON> Avram </PERSON> <PERSON> Brody </PERSON> did not meet the criteria needed for such a government-paid flight, which it estimated would cost $ 30,000. The 25-year-old man died of a brain tumor Wednesday night at his home in <LOCATION> Palmdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, Dr. <PERSON> Abdallah </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrukh </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` This one's a real sadness for the family. It's a heartbreaking time,'' said <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Office For Handicapped Affairs, who lobbied for the <PERSON> Brody </PERSON> family. `` I'm going to wonder probably for the rest of my life if we did n't do too little too late on this one. I wish we could have gotten them home.'' <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> regulations `` ignored a very sad and simple reality.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> had said it would allow such a flight for uniformed personnel, for someone whose illness had been caused by his work or if the flight would save a life. <PERSON> Brody </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said, did not meet any of those criteria. Also intervening in <PERSON> Brody </PERSON>'s behalf were Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, D-Mass., several members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Card </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> native After publicity about the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> refusal to provide an air ambulance, several private companies and individuals offered to provide a free flight.

 Lebanese lawmakers reached preliminary agreement today on a peace plan for their country, but <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> leader Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> rejected the plan and vowed to continue his war with Syrian troops. Radio stations said the plan calls for at least a partial withdrawal of Syrian troops from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and a limit on the powers of the Christian president. Conference sources said a Parliamentary committee led by house speaker <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON> agreed on the phrasing of the plan after a round-the-clock debate attended by the foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>. The committee broke up in the morning and was scheduled to meet again later to present its draft agreement to the 63 legislators meeting in <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION>. The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, would not elaborate on the tentative accord. But <PERSON> Najah </PERSON> <PERSON> Wakim </PERSON>, an Orthodox Christian, and <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rifai </PERSON>, a Moslem, told reporters they were `` optimistic'' after the overnight session. But <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said later: `` We can not rebuild our country under the shadow of an occupying force.'' `` Let those deputies understand that our <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s sovereignty and independence are not a matter for bargaining and negotiation,'' he said in a speech carried on Voice of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> radio. He vowed to pursue his `` war of liberation'' against <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, which has 40,000 troops stationed in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Lebanese radio stations earlier quoted deputies as saying differences over presidential powers and the issue of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s military presence in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> had been resolved The radio stations attributed the progress to the mediation of the three foreign ministers supervising the talks _ Prince <PERSON> Saud </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Faisal </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Abdel-Latif </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Filali </PERSON>, and <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghozaly </PERSON>. The three countries are grouped in an <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> committee entrusted with finding a settlement to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year-old civil war. The <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION>, a pro-Syrian station in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION>, said the committee today approved a timetable for a `` limited and phased'' Syrian withdrawal from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. They gave no details. Voice of the People said that although the president will continue to be a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, his powers will be curtailed. He will no longer have the power to issue general amnesties or dissolve <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> at will. A head of state will be able to dissolve the 99-seat Parliament only once during his six-year term, it said. He also will no longer be the commander in chief of the armed forces. Instead, the military command will report directly to the Cabinet, traditionally headed by a Sunni Moslem. Once a new head of state is elected, a committee grouping the president, prime minister and <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> speaker, usually a Shiite Moslem, will be formed to work on abolishing the sectarian system of government, the radio said. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> has been without a head of state since former President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>'s term ended Sept. 22, 1988. Under the sectarian system in force since independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1943, Christians, mainly the Maronites, have dominated <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, government, army and judiciary. Christians were once considered the majority in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Now, Moslems make up 55 percent of the 4 million people. The meeting in <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION> began Sept. 30. The Arab committee had first proposed that <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> complete a phased withdrawal from the <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> area within two years. It offered no timetable or guarantees for a complete withdrawal of the Syrian contingent, in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under a 1976 Arab League mandate. It linked it to an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> pullout from south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and the conclusion of a Lebanese-Syrian security pact. The Christians, who fought the Syrians this year for six months until an Arab League cease-fire halted the bloodshed Sept. 22, rejected the proposal. They conceded a quick pullout would leave a security vacuum and allow unruly militias to take over but insisted two years was too long for a withdrawal from <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. They demanded a timetable for withdrawal from northern and eastern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Moslems rejected any pullout of their Syrian protectors until political reforms curtailing the domination of Christians in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> have been enforced.

<TEXT>
 An appeals court today threw out the conviction of a career criminal accused of fatally shooting Prime Minister <PERSON> Olof </PERSON> <PERSON> Palme </PERSON> three years ago. Hours later, the defendant was freed from prison. Judge <PERSON> Birgitta </PERSON> <PERSON> Blom </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Svea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> said the court ruled there was not enough evidence to show that <PERSON> Christer </PERSON> <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON> stalked and killed <PERSON> Palme </PERSON> as the Swedish leader left a movie theater with his wife Feb. 28, 1986. <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON> was sentenced to life in prison and had been jailed in isolation since December. `` I'm surprised. I never really believed I would be acquitted, although I am innocent,'' <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON>, 42, told the national <ORGANIZATION> TT </ORGANIZATION> news agency after leaving the Kronoberg Prison with his lawyer and a police escort. Ms. <PERSON> Blom </PERSON>, the president of the appellate court, told Swedish radio the decision to overturn the conviction was unanimous. The decision is the culmination of a sensational case that authorities have been accused of bungling since its inception. Police for a year pursued a series of vastly different conspiracy theories before prosecuting <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON>, a drug and alcohol abuser with a long and varied criminal record. <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON> was convicted in July even though no motive was established, no weapon was found and no witnesses testified to seeing the Swede fire five shots at the dynamic leader on a darkened street. The appellate court judgment may be referred to the Swedish <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. But because the high court usually agrees only to hear cases that could form legal precedent, legal experts have said it probably would not hear <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON>'s case. In addition, experts had said if the conviction were overturned it would be virtually impossible to find Palme's killer, since all the witnesses police could find pointed to <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON> as the man they saw at the crime scene. <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON>'s three-week appeal hearing was presided over by a jury of three laymen and four professional jurors. The hearing ended Monday. The court had set Nov. 2 for announcing its verdict, but the national news agency <ORGANIZATION> TT </ORGANIZATION> said the jury concluded in only three days that `` the investigation into the case was insufficient for a conviction.'' The written verdict will be released Nov. 2. Palme was a four-term prime minister and a dominant figure in the international socialist and disarmament movements. He also was a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mediator in the Iran-Iraq war. The conviction by a tribunal of six laymen and two professional judges was based largely on the identification of <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON> by <PERSON> Palme </PERSON>'s widow, <PERSON> Lisbeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Palme </PERSON>, who was walking home with her husband when he was shot from behind at close range. Mrs. <PERSON> Palme </PERSON> said she saw <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON> standing a few feet away after her husband was shot. She was grazed by a bullet and slightly wounded. Several other witnesses said they saw <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON> apparently waiting for the Palmes to emerge from the theater. But no one saw <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON> with a gun, and police failed to produce any forensic evidence to link him to the shooting. <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON> denied shooting Palme and said he was not in central <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> when the killing took place at 11.21 p.m.. One witness testified to seeing <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON> at a train station far from the shooting scene at the time of the slaying The two judges in the trial voted for acquittal, but the six laymen voted to convict. The initial investigation into the slaying focused on a series of conspiracy theories. Most centered on Kurdish militants, others centered on Iranian or Iraqi government assassins and still another focused on a secret cadre of right-wing police officers upset with <PERSON> Palme </PERSON>'s leftist politics. All were dismissed as essentially groundless. Four hours before <PERSON> Palme </PERSON> was shot, the files of a tax investigation against him disappeared in a break-in at the county administrative appeals court. All computer files were obliterated and all documents were stolen. No connection with the killing was ever established. The botched probe resulted in a series of resignations and firings. The befuddling case has developed an aura of mystery that has been likened to the doubts that still haunt the assassination of former President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. Several top police officials and Justice Minister <PERSON> Anna-Greta </PERSON> <PERSON> Leijon </PERSON> eventually were forced to resign because of their involvement in an unauthorized, privately led investigation into the case.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took time out today from affairs of state to boost a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate involved in a tough battle to keep a <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> congressional seat held by the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> for 16 years. In his return to the campaign trail, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> echoed themes that served him well in the 1988 presidential election, citing Republican <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s devotion to `` traditional values.'' The president also emphasized <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s long experience as a congressional aide and his service as ambassador to <LOCATION> Barbados </LOCATION>, which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said made him `` a point man in the drug interdiction effort.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also noted that he has accepted the invitation of the presidents of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> _ the source countries for cocaine sold in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ to attend a drug summit within 90 days. `` I've instructed my administration to prepare for a summit that will bring us to a new level of international cooperation in this war we must win,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told an audience of several thousand. `` As long as I am president, I will give as much support as he needs to President -LRB- <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> -RRB- Barco -LRB- of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> -RRB-, who is waging an all-out fight'' against drug lords. Later <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was attending a reception and dinner for <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> mayoral candidate <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. He also was flying to the <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, airport to meet briefly with Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Courter </PERSON>, the Republican gubernatorial nominee, and then attend a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> reception for Rep. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Molinari </PERSON>, who is running for borough president of <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told an outdoor rally in <LOCATION> Gulfport </LOCATION> that as a longtime aide to former congressman and now-Sen. <PERSON> Trent </PERSON> <PERSON> Lott </PERSON>, R-Miss., <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> `` knows the back roads of the Fifth District ... just as he knows the corridors of <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 43, is running against <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> Sen. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> for the seat left vacant by the death of Rep. <PERSON> Larkin </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, R-Miss., in an August plane crash <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> bested <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> in the Oct. 3 open primary and is the favorite in Tuesday's special election. `` You know <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>, and all of you know what makes southern <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> what it is. <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> values. Traditional values. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s values,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the hometown crowd. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also used the event to echo what aides said Tuesday: he will attend a drug summit with leaders of the Andean nations of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>. He praised the citizens of <LOCATION> Gulfport </LOCATION>, themselves hit by <PERSON> Hurricane </PERSON> <PERSON> Camille </PERSON> 20 years ago, for their relief efforts in the wake of Hurricane Hugo. The <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> race is seen as a tough one for <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, a longtime aide to <PERSON> Trent </PERSON> <PERSON> Lott </PERSON>, the state's <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> senator who served in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> before his 1988 election to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The runoff election between <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> is a high-stakes contest for both Democrats and Republicans, who have held the seat for 16 years. It is the latest in a handful of special elections around the country this year that serve as opening skirmishes for the 1990 national elections and the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>'s perpetual battle to wrest control of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> away from the Democrats. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> has spent heavily, reporting $ 447,700 in spending by the end of September, not including large television advertising buys just prior to the Oct. 3 primary election in the 5th Congressional District. But <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, who spent $ 88,606 through Sept. 27, outpolled <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and a third candidate in the primary election indicating what Democrats say is a shift away from the Republican habit. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> has touted his longtime experience in the district as <PERSON> Lott </PERSON>'s aide, and <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> is relying on his legislative experience. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> advance aides said they were setting up today's planned meeting with <PERSON> Courter </PERSON> at the airport. Recent polls showed <PERSON> Courter </PERSON> lagging 14 to 23 points behind Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate for governor. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appears tonight for <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, whose bid to beat Democrat <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Borough </LOCATION> president, in the mayoral contest is lagging. Democrats outnumber Republicans 5-1 in the city and <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> is widely considered a shoo-in although <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> began the race well ahead of both incumbent Mayor <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> in the polls. A series of missteps and revelations have led to his slide, including disclosure that his law firm was on retainer for the government of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and incidents that agitated the Jewish community. Most recently, comedian <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, a key supporter, was accused of making ethnic slurs against <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> and stereotyping Jews. <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> also ran into ethnic criticism, leading to his announcement Wednesday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that campaign aide <PERSON> Jitu </PERSON> <PERSON> Weusi </PERSON> would leave in the wake of criticism by the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith. The B'nai B'rith said <PERSON> Weusi </PERSON> once referred to Jews as `` vile money-changers'' and `` shylocks'' and also wrote `` scores of anti-Semitic articles.'' <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> toured <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> on Wednesday, receiving a warm welcome from congressional leaders and meeting also with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Secretary of Housing and Urban development, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, on housing issues <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> earlier in the month. Asked if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> would help <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> said, `` I assume it will help him raise some money but I do n't know that it will do him much good beyond that. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is not a Republican town.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s appearance for <PERSON> Molinari </PERSON> is intended to help <PERSON> Molinari </PERSON>'s bid for borough president against <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> incumbent <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamberti </PERSON>

 Ground has been broken for a `` Space Mirror'' monument to memorialize the 14 astronauts who have died while pursuing the goals of the space program. A member of each of their families was on hand at a ceremony Wednesday at <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> to place a star on the cornerstone of the Astronaut Memorial, inspired by the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger. `` To Those Who Gave Their Lives To Bring The Stars A Little Closer,'' read a plaque unveiled on the cornerstone for the $ 5 million memorial, to be completed next year. `` We honor their courage, because so few of us are courageous. We honor their knowledge, because so few of us can understand the unknown. We honor their quest, because it is the way to the future,'' said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Helman </PERSON>, founder of the <ORGANIZATION> Astronauts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. The `` Space Mirror'' will be 42 -LCB- feet high by 50 feet wide, constructed of mirror-finished granite with the names of the 14 cut through its surface like a stencil. The entire memorial will track the sun throughout the day, enabling mirrors behind the cut-out names to reflect sunlight back through the image of the sky reflected on the polished granite.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said Thursday a meeting of the Israeli and Egyptian foreign ministers to revive <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace efforts, proposed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, was an `` inflated'' and unnecessary idea. It was his first response to the suggestion last week by Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> in connection with the Egyptian proposal for a meeting in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> delegation. In <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> sources said chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> would be under pressure from other <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leaders at a meeting next week to take a tough line on <LOCATION> Palestinian-Israeli </LOCATION> talks. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said in a speech in the <LOCATION> Raanana </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> wants to meet with Palestinians to discuss procedures for elections in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, a key element of an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> peace plan set forth in April. He added, however: `` We do n't need to involve ... ministers, foreign ministers or heads of state. It should be a technical discussion. This has been turned into, inflated into something politically big, into some big event.'' His remarks were broadcast on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, who leads the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, repeated <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s refusal to involve the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, a serious obstacle to starting negotiations <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> defines the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> as a terrorist group. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> media, quoting sources in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> leaders were growing impatient with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s failure to respond to the latest peace proposals. The daily <ORGANIZATION> Haaretz </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials sent `` sharp messages,'' citing the latest pronouncements of hardliners in <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s party who oppose meeting with Palestinians in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> told Israeli reporters Thursday, however, that he `` does not have the impression <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> has run out of patience,'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio reported. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> proposed an Israeli-Palestinian meeting as a way of bridging differences between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> over <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s plan for elections to choose Palestinians to negotiate with the Israelis. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> objected that the Israeli plan did not guarantee Palestinians an independent state after a proposed five-year period of Palestinian self-rule in the territories, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has occupied since the 1967 war. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s Cabinet leadership rejected <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s proposals Oct. 6 on a tie vote of six <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> members and six from the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which is the other partner in the coalition government and supports the Egyptian approach. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> subsequently telephoned <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> and <PERSON> Esmat </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel-Meguid </PERSON>, the Egyptian foreign minister, and proposed they meet in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to find a compromise way of choosing a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> delegation. The sources in the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> capital said the <ORGANIZATION> Palestinian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, to begin meeting on Sunday, will put pressure on <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> to reject any attempt to exclude the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> from peace talks with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. A senior council member told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> privately that radical factions called the meeting to stop <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> from accepting Egyptian and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts toward a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace effort that might not include the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have n't endorsed the so-called <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> plan and we will never accept a plan short of full <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> participation in any peace process,'' he said. The Marxist Democratic Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION>, the largest <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> factions after <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s own Fatah, have denounced the Egyptian proposals.

<HEAD>Chancellor Says British Interest Rates Stay High, However Unpopular</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BLACKPOOL, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s chancellor of the exchequer said Thursday he will continue a policy of increasing interest rates to curb inflation, and he brushed aside fears the economy is heading into recession. Addressing the annual conference of Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> ignored pressure to link the pound to other major <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> currencies through the European Monetary System. `` Inevitably people ask whether there is an alternative to high interest rates at the present time,'' said <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>. `` Bluntly, the answer is that there is no alternative and the policy will work.'' The four-day conference, which ends Friday, has been overshadowed by <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>'s decision last week to raise interests rates to an eight-year high of 15 percent, hitting businesses and millions of home buyers. <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>'s tactic of using high interest rates to curb inflation and to try to keep the pound steady against the West German mark, has prompted renewed demands to put the British currency into the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System. The European Monetary System links the currencies of eight of the 12 Common Market nations in order to prevent wide swings in exchange rate movements. <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> made no mention of the issue in his speech, but later, in broadcast interviews, he repeated the Conservative government's position that it would join the mechanism when it felt the time is right He would n't be drawn on what the timetable might be. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, who was seated alongside <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> as he addressed the 9,000 delegates, has set stringent conditions for British entry to the European currency-stabilizing system. They include a lowering in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s 7.3 inflation rate and that other member countries must _ like <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> _ allow totally free movement of capital. The financial markets were soothed by <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>'s speech. The markets were watching it closely because of a recent sharp drop in the pound despite last week's interest rate hike. The pound rose to $ 1.5520 from $ 1.5425 late Wednesday, and dipped slightly to 2.9597 West German marks from 2.9632 marks. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index finished 19 points, or 0.9 percent, higher at 2,237.8. <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>, who was loudly applauded, said he has `` no easy answers.'' `` But I give you this pledge. I will continue to take whatever action is needed, however unpopular it may be, to keep our economy sound and strong,'' he added. The Confederation of British Industry, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s main business group, said <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>'s approach was `` exactly what the situation demanded.'' The opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> jibed that <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> merely `` rehashed failed policies'' and the <ORGANIZATION> Trades </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the national labor federation, accused him of complacency. General Secretary <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> urged British membership in the exchange rate mechanism. Foreign Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Major </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> should not be defensive about its `` common sense'' approach to the 12-nation European Economic Community. `` For it is we who have breathed new life into it -LRB- the community -RRB-,'' Major said. `` It is our show.

 About 45 law officers were assigned to keep the peace at racially tense <ORGANIZATION> Minor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> today after a melee in which the principal and a teen-ager were stabbed and six students arrested. Students had to pass through a metal detector and go directly to class, bypassing their usual gathering places, including the lunchroom that white and black students turned into a battleground Wednesday. During the brawl, a teacher fired shots into the air to restore order, teen-agers sprayed <PERSON> Mace </PERSON> on schoolmates, and some teachers and coaches fought students, authorities and witnesses said. `` There was mass confusion, running and screaming everywhere,'' said police Sgt. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>, who was knocked down and sprayed with <PERSON> Mace </PERSON>. Officers today arrested two teen-agers outside and confiscated beer, a BB gun, crowbars and spiked gloves and wristbands. Sheriff's Lt. <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> said the two did not appear to be students at Minor. <PERSON> Principal </PERSON> <PERSON> Judson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who suffered a two-inch knife cut to his abdomen, said a biracial committee of parents will look for solutions to the problems. `` We want to address them and get back to the real job of being here. That's to educate the kids. We seem to have lost that,'' he said. Some students and police said conflict among the school's 967 students stemmed partly from black gang activity and what blacks viewed as taunting by whites. The school northwest of <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> is about 25 percent black. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, a 17-year-old black senior, said the fight broke out when a white dressed like the black rock guitarist <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendrix </PERSON> `` with dirt on his hands to make them look black.'' He said blacks were sent to the lunchroom and whites to the gym, but as many as 50 whites entered the lunchroom `` in a straight line with all these wepaons _ <PERSON> Mace </PERSON> and forks. It just went off. They jumped all these black people who were eating.'' `` There's always been racial trouble here,'' he said. `` They did n't want us here anyway.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Doren </PERSON>, a 16-year-old white, said when the whites went into the lunchroom, blacks started hollering `` and started walking around us. We stood up and everybody started fighting.'' <PERSON> Doren </PERSON> said that when a white student walks down a hall alone, `` four or five blacks will jump on him. They will find a person walking down the hall and run and jump on him.'' `` It's going to keep on going,'' he said. `` We've got to get rid of the gangs to stop it.'' A black senior, 17-year-old <PERSON> Bellamy </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, said blacks had objected to the suspension of blacks for cutting their names into their hair. <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Drummonds </PERSON>, a 17-year-old white, was stabbed in the shoulder. He received stitches at a hospital and returned to school. Six students were arrested, said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, chief sheriff's deputy He said five were to be charged with rioting and the sixth was to be charged with assault with intent to murder. A teacher who fired shots into the air in an attempt to quell the disturbance was sent home and faces disciplinary action, said <PERSON> Nez </PERSON> <PERSON> Calhoun </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the school board. The teacher had carried the gun because of earlier problems, an unidentified witness told the <ORGANIZATION> Birmingham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-Herald </ORGANIZATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> urged <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials Thursday to continue `` as aggressively as possible'' their investigation into allegations that Namibian guerrillas have committed human rights abuses against fellow rebels for more than a decade. Department spokesman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is pleased that <PERSON> Martti </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahtisaari </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> special representative in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, has pursued the allegations made against the rebels of the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, known as <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ahtisaari </PERSON> said at a news conference in <LOCATION> Windhoek </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, on Wednesday that he has been unable so far to verify reports that <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> members imprisoned, tortured and killed hundreds from their own ranks since 1977. In visits to <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> camps in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> team said it could not find a single detainee among the 1,100 cases it is investigating. But <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said 315 people of the 1,100 have not yet been found. `` We note that his report ... states categorically that the investigation will continue,'' <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said. `` We are concerned at this large number of persons unaccounted for and encourage UNTAG -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- to pursue their cases and any others that may come to its attention as aggressively as possible,'' she said. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> leaders, she said, have `` admitted their organization detained certain persons it regards as spies sent by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> must `` provide a full accounting for those persons immediately,'' <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> is expected to win a majority in the Nov. 7 elections in which Namibians are to elect an assembly to draft a constitution for the independence of their country, a former <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> trust territory governed by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> waged a guerrilla war against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> for 23 years.

<HEAD>Psychiatrists to Decide Whether to Readmit Soviets to World Group</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Members of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> gathered Thursday at a conference to decide whether to readmit colleagues from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The international professional body for psychiatrists, meeting for the first time in six years, is taking up the Soviet question during its weeklong congress amid allegations that political dissidents are still being punished in Soviet psychiatric hospitals. In a preliminary meeting Wednesday, the group's executive committee, led by its president, <PERSON> Kostas </PERSON> <PERSON> Stefanis </PERSON>, recommended re-entry for the Soviets, known officially as the <ORGANIZATION> All-Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatrists </ORGANIZATION> and Narcologists. The Soviet state-sanctioned society was forced to withdraw from the world body in 1983 after allegations surfaced that dissidents were being certified as insane. `` The Soviets admit that some excesses took place in their country in the past, and say that these will not be repeated in the future,'' <PERSON> Stefanis </PERSON> said. Three dissident Soviet psychiatrists who have been interned in psychiatric hospitals and now live in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> said before the congress opened that admitting the official Soviet group would be `` tantamount to condoning abuse.'' One of the men, <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Koryagin </PERSON>, said the Soviet psychiatric establishment has admitted individual instances of wrong diagnosis but continues to deny the systematic abuse of psychiatry. The congress opened in a tense atmosphere after the association's general assembly clashed in the preliminary session over voting procedures that will affect the ballot on the Soviet issue. Delegates from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> alleged that changes to voting statutes proposed by the association's executive committee were aimed at facilitating re-entry for the Soviets, according to sources at the meeting. The association's general assembly is scheduled to vote on the Soviet question Tuesday. The association's executive committee executive came under fire from some of its members in March when it gave provisional membership to the official Soviet group, pending a final decision at the <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> congress. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation led by a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official went to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in February to check claims that psychiatry was no longer being used as a political weapon. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> psychiatrists said that despite some progress, more legal safeguards were needed to prevent the hospitalization of dissidents. On the basis of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> report, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a member of the international body, decided to vote against full membership for the Soviet society at the <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> congress. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Voren </PERSON>, the leader of a Netherlands-based human rights group that is campaigning against re-entry of the Soviets, said the use of psychiatry for politcal reasons is still common in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` We have evidence of 40 dissidents who are being held in Soviet Psychiatric institutions for political reasons,'' <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Voren </PERSON> said in an interview. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Voren </PERSON>'s pressure group, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> on the Political Use of Psychiatry, will brief delegates on allegations of psychiatric abuse in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> before the vote. The main group will also decide on whether to admit a second Soviet society of psychiatrists, the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. That association, which does not have the backing of the Soviet government, also maintains that the political use of psychiatry is still continuing in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The international group can admit both Soviet associations. The congress also will discuss about 3,400 research papers on psychiatry written by members of the world organization.

 Labor Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> will visit striking coal miners Friday in southwest <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> for a first-hand look at the six-month walkout involving <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> mines in three states, a department official said Thursday. `` She's frustrated and wants something to happen. Obviously, she wants to see the strike resolved,'' said spokeswoman <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>, adding that Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> is n't taking sides in the dispute. Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> met earlier in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>. `` We think that's a tremendous step in the right direction,'' <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> said Thursday about Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s trip. The <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> official spoke at a news conference during which several international labor leaders expressed strong concern over the coal strike. `` Let's not beat around the <PERSON> bush </PERSON> _ this is a union-busting dispute,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanderveken </PERSON>, general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Confederation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unions </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Vanderveken </PERSON> said his <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, Belgium-based organization, which represents unions with 88 million members around the world, was preparing to file a formal complaint with the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> citing `` flagrant worker abuses'' involved with the <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> strike. `` We have no double standards,'' he said. `` If something is wrong in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, we say so. And if something is wrong in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, we say so also.'' <PERSON> Vanderveken </PERSON> said the handling of the coal miners' strike by state and federal authorities demonstrated that the enforcement of labor law in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is `` heavily stacked in favor of management.'' The delegation of foreign labor leaders met earlier Thursday with <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON>, and spent Wednesday in the southwest <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> coalfields after meeting with <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>. Contract talks resumed Thursday in suburban <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> after a six-week break, but neither the company nor the union expected any breakthroughs. They can not even agree to meet in the same room and have been using a federal mediator to relay messages. The strike involving <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>'s 1,695 union employees in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> began April 5 and has become a rallying point for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> labor movement. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Michalzik </PERSON>, general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Miners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, also based in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, told striking miners at a rally Wednesday: `` The <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> strike is the No. 1 priority in our organization.'' <PERSON> Jacek </PERSON> <PERSON> Merkel </PERSON>, an official of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s Solidarity union who directed shipyard strikes in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, said Solidarity won its eight-year battle for recognition with support from labor around the world. Now, he said, he wants to stand with the UMW. `` My boss, <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, appealed to our government, ` Let's start negotiating.' I wish that here, <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> would start negotiating,'' <PERSON> Merkel </PERSON> said.

 Ten years ago, <PERSON> Giorgio </PERSON> <PERSON> Armani </PERSON> introduced his liningless jacket and the `` moda Milanese'' was born. Now at the start of a new decade, it looks like <ORGANIZATION> Milan </ORGANIZATION>'s favorite son will continue to be the mainstay of Italian ready-to-wear, after the success of his new spring-summer 1990 collection presented Wednesday night. `` He's simply the best,'' said <PERSON> Kal </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruttenstein </PERSON>, vice-president of fashion for <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>.

At the beginning of the summer, <PERSON> Gianfranco </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferre </PERSON> accepted the post of designate designer at the famed house of Dior, and his first couture collection in July was a success. <PERSON> Ferre </PERSON> still designs his own label out of <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>, but whereas optimists see the Dior job as a feather in Italian fashion's cap, others _ including <PERSON> Armani </PERSON> _ view it as a <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> victory in the eternal fashion battle between the two countries. In a recent interview in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s weekly <ORGANIZATION> L'Espresso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Armani </PERSON> commented wryly: `` Does anyone really think the French are stupid enough to promote an Italian name?'' For the moment, <PERSON> Armani </PERSON> is satisfied to launch his fashion fantasy from <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>, and his new collection is proof that things are calm in the Armani empire, which includes more than 100 Emporio shops in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>; 200 stores in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> that carry his line; and his own stores in such major capitals as <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The new Armani style for the spring-summer 1990, presented to a select crowd of 1,000 fashion followers in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>'s elegant <PERSON> Palazzo </PERSON> <PERSON> Senato </PERSON>, is long and languid. Airy fabrics and loose styles which often draw their inspiration from <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> give the collection a soft, serene look. His new jacket is extra long, either double-breasted, with three buttons or no buttons at all. Sleeves are often over-long, and the newest jacket is closed over the front to button at the shoulder. Although the look is of natural simplicity, almost too simple for its $ 1,000 price tag, the workmanship is <PERSON> Armani </PERSON> perfection, and the fabrics are luxuriously light raw silks and feather-weight wools. These jackets are worn over short, seemingly hemless skirts or baggy trousers. From <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Armani </PERSON> brought back the harem pant, which he puts under sporty jackets by day, under tunics and lavish evening gowns by night. His favorite harem pant lightly sweeps the floor in silk chiffon or georgette, often worn with an Indian embroidered strapless top. For that special evening, <PERSON> Armani </PERSON> embroiders his softly draped gowns with myriads of crystals and pearls. His new evening look is a short embroidered gown with a puffed-out skating skirt over airy harem pants. Colors match the soft warmth of a <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> summer night, twilight blue, sunset red, dusk white, pine green, burnt yellow and terracotta orange. Prints copied the designs of delicate oriental porcelain and Middle Eastern pottery. <PERSON> Armani </PERSON> is not one for ornate accessories. In keeping with the simplicity of the collection, he displayed only large drop earrings. Footwear is soft and flat, allowing his models to steal down the runway like thieves in an Arabian night.

 Four American scientists reacted with delight Thursday at being named Nobel Prize winners for their work in physics and chemistry, and one said it was time to `` go back to the lab and do more work.'' The physics award was given to <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> for measurement techniques that led to the cesium atomic clock, and to <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dehmelt </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for a method to isolate single atoms and make exacting measurements of them. The Nobel Prize in chemistry is shared by <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Cech </PERSON>, 41, of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Altman </PERSON>, 50, of <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. They showed independently in the 1970s and early 1980s that RNA, then thought to be merely a genetic messenger inside the cell, could rearrange itself and produce chemical reactions. Half the physics prize will go to <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON>, 74. The other half will be shared by the German-born <PERSON> Dehmelt </PERSON>, 67, of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, 76, of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bonn </ORGANIZATION>. Each Nobel Prize is worth $ 469,000. `` I am obviously excited about it,'' said <PERSON> Cech </PERSON>, who was visiting <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> to receive a prize for genetic work from <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. `` It was something that everybody has been telling me would happen, but I had no way of knowing when.'' While Nobel Prize celebrations may be relatively common in the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> area, <PERSON> Cech </PERSON> pointed out they are rarer elsewhere. `` My main emotion is that this is a great thing for the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> and the state of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` This is not the sort of thing that happens annually in the mountains the way it does in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. That gives me a really good feeling.'' Asked about his plans for the money, he said: `` I have two young daughters who are very good at spending money.'' <PERSON> Dehmelt </PERSON> said he did n't mind being awakened at 4 a.m. by a caller from the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swedish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> to be told of the award. `` I'm elated,'' <PERSON> Dehmelt </PERSON> said from his <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> apartment overlooking <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The prize and its prestige should make his work easier, he said. One of the applications of his research is to make an atomic clock thousands of times more accurate than any before. `` The clocks are very universally useful. They can be used in navigation and missiles, and of course the military loves them. They did n't give me any money, though,'' <PERSON> Dehmelt </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> said he was `` pleased and delighted and surprised'' to learn he was awarded half the prize for inventing a precise method for measuring time, by measuring the frequency of radiation from atoms. `` Basically, I'm interested in all the laws of nature,'' said <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON>, who attributed his long interest in science to the fact that `` it's fun.'' <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> said he may use his prize money to defray the cost of traveling to <LOCATION> Grenoble </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, where he conducts research. But he mentioned his wife would like him to buy a new car. <PERSON> Altman </PERSON>, at a news conference in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, thanked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> taxpayers, who he said provided the funds that the government appropriated for research. The native of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> held up a <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> pennant that contained a small replica of the Canadian flag. `` I'll just go back to the lab and do more work,'' he said. `` And just try to understand the things I'm trying to understand.'' <PERSON> Altman </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> faculty since 1971, is now a professor of biology. He was dean of <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> from July 1986 through June 1989.

 Four American scientists and a West German won the Nobel Prizes in physics and chemistry Thursday for discoveries that have given the world exact measurement of time and could help explain the origins of life. Canadian-born <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Altman </PERSON>, 50, of <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Cech </PERSON>, 41, of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>, won the chemistry prize for their `` discovery of catalytic properties of RNA,'' the citation said. <PERSON> Bertil </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersson </PERSON> of the Nobel committee of the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swedish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> said their work has forced `` the rewrite of whole chapters'' in chemistry textbooks and could help reveal how life began. It changed dogmas from the turn of the century on how living cells function, he said. The discovery also will `` probably provide a new tool for gene technology, with potential to create a new defense against viral infections'' and virus-resistant plants, the academy said. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON>, 74, of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, was given half the physics prize for inventing a method for measuring time on which the current standard of time is based. Since 1967, because of <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON>'s discovery, time has been measured by the movement within the smallest particle of matter rather than the rotation of Earth. <PERSON> Ingvar </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindgren </PERSON>, chairman of the awards committee, said the atomic clock deviates by just 1,000 th of a second in 300 years German-born <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dehmelt </PERSON>, 67, of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, 76, of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bonn </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, shared the other half of the $ 469,000 prize for developing ways of trapping particles to study a them with extreme precision. They realized `` a long-felt dream'' of scientists in the field, the academy declared. <PERSON> Lindgren </PERSON> said the three laureates `` have developed exact methods of measurement which has made it possible to conduct experiments that might force us to reconsider some basic physical laws, especially regarding time and space.'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> heard the news on his car radio and joked later that his ion trap was an invention `` to measure every speck of dust.' `` This is a surprise for me,'' he said. `` I never saw, myself, the practical relevance of it.'' <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> said at his home in <LOCATION> Massechusetts </LOCATION>: `` It feels great. I'm just delighted, and I'm delighted with the people with whom I'm sharing the prize <PERSON> Cech </PERSON> was reached in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and said: `` I am obviously excited about it. It was something that everyone has been telling me would happen, but I had no way of knowing when.'' Asked about plans for his half of the chemistry prize money, he replied: `` I have two young daughters who are very good at spending money.'' <PERSON> Altman </PERSON> said from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, `` I'm very happy. I'm very grateful to all my colleagues and co-workers, teachers and family.'' <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> developed a way to study the structure of atoms by exciting them to different energy levels, using two oscillating electromagnetic fields. That led to development of the hydrogen maser, a laser-like device that excites hydrogen atoms and provided the most detailed determination of their internal structure. It has been used to test <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON>'s general theory of relativity and in measuring the continental drift, the academy said. Another application was the cesium atomic clock, in which cesium atoms are excited to higher levels. `` I was really studying the fundamental properties of atoms and nuclei, and ... it was apparent this was a very, very stable clock,'' <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> said. `` It gets used in radio astronomy, navigation, satellite navigation, many other purposes.'' <PERSON> Dehmelt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> were recognized for developing the technique for trapping single ions, electrically charged atoms, according to weight. <PERSON> Lindgren </PERSON> said `` ion traps'' could provide even more exact time measurement in the future. <PERSON> Cech </PERSON> and <PERSON> Altman </PERSON> showed independently that RNA, or ribonucleic acid, could be a catalyst, or trigger, for chemical reactions in the cell. Their discoveries disproved a 75-year-old dogma that enzymes, or the triggers of reactions inside cells, are always proteins. They proved RNA also can be a catalyst, not just the messenger of genetic codes from DNA, said <PERSON> Andersson </PERSON>, the Nobel committee member. When <PERSON> Altman </PERSON> discovered in 1978 that RNA could produce catalytic reactions in the cell, the discovery was met with disbelief and `` he could hardly believe it himself,'' <PERSON> Andersson </PERSON> said. Four years later <PERSON> Cech </PERSON>, demonstrated that the RNA molecule was not only necessary to the reaction but could trigger the reaction by itself, without associated proteins previously thought essential. <PERSON> Andersson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Cech </PERSON> and <PERSON> Altman </PERSON> worked independently, but `` like a Ping Pong match, the ball went from one to the other.'' Their discoveries may provide a method to destroy harmful RNA molecules that cause infections, such as the common cold, and eventually also provide cures for hereditary diseases, the academy said. <PERSON> Cech </PERSON>, born in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, has been at <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION> since 1983. He received his doctorate from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Altman </PERSON>, born in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, earned his doctorate at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION>, studied at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION> and moved to <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> in 1971. <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> has been at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, since 1947. <PERSON> Dehmelt </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen, was born in <LOCATION> Goerlitz </LOCATION>, now in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, went to <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> as a student in 1952 and has been at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> since 1955. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Lorenzkirch </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and became professor of experimental physics at <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> in 1952.

 Summary: The work of the Laureates in Physics has led to a dramatic development in the field of atomic precision spectroscopy in recent years. The resonance method of Professor <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>, using separated oscillatory fields forms the basis of the cesium atomic clock, which is our present time standard. Professor Dr. <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bonn </ORGANIZATION>, Federal Republic of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and Professor <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dehmelt </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>, have introduced and developed the ion trap technique which has made it possible to study a single electron or a single ion with extreme precision. <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> and co-workers have also developed the hydrogen maser, which is at present our most stable source of electromagnetic radiation. The methods have been used in testing fundamental physical principles such as quantum electrodynamics -LRB- QED -RRB- and the general theory of relativity. Another application is in space communication and for measuring continental drift. The techniques have reached an unprecedented level of precision, and the development does not yet seem to have culminated.

 Summary: This year's Nobel Prize in chemistry has been awarded to <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Altman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Cech </PERSON>, <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> for their discovery that RNA -LRB- ribonucleic acid -RRB- in living cells is not only a molecule of heredity but also can function as a biocatalyst. This discovery, which came as a complete surprise to scientists, concerns fundamental aspects of the molecular basis of life. Many chapters in our textbooks have to be revised. Many chemical reactions can not occur without a catalyst. A catalyst is a molecule which can facilitate a chemical reaction without being consumed or changed. Virtually all chemical reactions taking place in a living cell require catalysts. Such biocatalysts are called enzymes. For example in saliva there is an enzyme which converts starch to glucose, in the liver there is another enzyme which breaks down alcohol. There are also enzymes that enable plants to convert the carbon dioxide in the air to sugar and starch. Until the results of <PERSON> Altman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cech </PERSON> became known, all enzymes were considered to be proteins. The specific properties and functions of a protein are determined by hereditary characters, or genes. Genes are composed of deoxyribonucleic acid, better known as DNA. The genetic information in DNA is arranged as a string of codes which determine the design of the proteins. However, before this information can be used for protein synthesis, the code must be transcribed into another type of nucleic acid, RNA. <PERSON> Altman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cech </PERSON> have now independently discovered that RNA is not only a molecule of heredity but can also serve as a biocatalyst. In addition to this conceptual influence on basic natural sciences, the discovery of catalytic RNA will probably provide a new tool for gene technology, with potential to create a new defense against viral infections.

<HEAD>Thornburgh Supports Disabled Rights Legislation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration declared its unqualified support Thursday for Senate-passed civil rights legislation to protect the estimated 43 million disabled Americans. The Americans With Disabilities Act is `` fair, balanced legislation'' that `` does not place undue burdens on Americans who comply,'' Attorney General <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passed the legislation Sept. 7 by a vote of 76-8. The bill was the result of negotiations between senators and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to soften some of the impact on business. During testimony last June before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> had expressed administration support but with some reservations. He said Thursday those concerns had been resolved in negotiations. The bill guarantees the disabled equal access to public accommodations _ restaurants, shops, movie theaters and doctors offices, for example _ and to employment opportunities. As a result of the compromise, the requirements will be phased in and punitive damages will be disallowed. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> defended the bill against claims by the business community that its provisions are vague. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> cited previous laws, including civil rights requirements for companies that receive government grants or contracts. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> declined to support a request by the business community that it be allowed tax credits for architectural modifications needed to meet the requirements of the law. Existing law allows for tax deductions for those alterations. `` That has been suggested and examined,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. `` It has an equitable appeal. But because of the fiscal situation and restraints, the administration does not support such a credit.'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> also defended the administration's support of the measure against challenges by Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dannemeyer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Calif </LOCATION>., who suggested that most people infected with the AIDS virus should be excluded from protection Referring to people who acquired the virus through homosexual contact or drug use, <PERSON> Dannemeyer </PERSON> asked whether someone should be covered who had a `` communicable disease'' as a result of `` misconduct.'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> replied that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has pledged to support legislation forbidding discrimination against HIV-infected people, a recommendation made by the AIDS commission headed by now Energy Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>. `` It's not always easy to prove how the AIDS was acquired,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> added. AIDS is also acquired through heterosexual contact and blood transfusions. Also Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> telecommunications and finance subcommittee approved a portion of the act that requires telephone companies to provide a special relay service to the speech or hearing impaired. The service would be available at no additional charge. The service involves use of typewriter-like devices that permit written messages to be sent by telephone. A telephone operator then relays either a spoken or written message to another person. The bill is before seven subcommittees of four House committees. Supporters, including <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, have said they hope to have a bill passed and ready for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s signature before the end of the year.

 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> said Thursday that the Soviet-led <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> assures `` a certain form of military stability'' in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> also predicted both military alliances would survive the 1990s, even amid political change in the East and West. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, according to the former West German defense minister, guarantees peace and peaceful change. `` I have no doubt if you were an East European you would see it as the main source of stability,'' <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> said at a news conference. Similarily, he said, the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact serves a useful purpose. `` It guarantees a certain form of military stability,'' <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> said. `` As you can see, it does not prevent change'' in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and in a `` mild form'' in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` It's not our role to make a settlement guaranteeing the existence of both or one pact,'' <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> said. `` That would be a major mistake. That is not the question.'' But, he said of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact: `` I only think that being interested in military stability for the foreseeable future, the next decade where we have to ensure a peaceful change, I think it can and might play a useful role.'' <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> said the two alliances would operate in the future with fewer weapons and in a posture of defense. However, he stressed <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> should not be dissolved. `` Even in a landscape of political change we need the solid and sound defense,'' he said. `` Turmoil is in the air every time there is change.'' Besides, he said, if Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> failed in his program to restructure the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> `` someone could look for a military solution to their problems.'' <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> appeared before a session of the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION>, a private research group that promotes <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ties with <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> passed a resolution Thursday for better protection of the environment, and a leading party official told dissidents not to use environmental issues for political purposes. The offficial news agency <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> said the resolution, passed at the end of a two-day <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting, specified reductions in heavy industry and metallurgy, lower energy consumption and introduction of new technologies. On Wednesday, Politburo member <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Knotek </PERSON> told the committee: `` We must act resolutely against unrealistic, destructive and ... anti-socialist attitudes manifested in the actions of the so-called informal or illegal groups,'' <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> reported. `` They abuse the justified interest of our people in improving the environment. ... Their demagogy stops at nothing.'' Police dispersed 300 activists Sept. 13 who were protesting construction of a coke plant at <LOCATION> Stonava </LOCATION>, near the Polish border. Environmentalists also oppose a joint Hungarian-Czechoslovak dam project on the <LOCATION> Danube </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Talks between Premier <PERSON> Ladislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> and his Hungarian counterpart, <PERSON> Miklos </PERSON> <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON>, on Wednesday brought little progress in resolving the deadlock over the dam project, which <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> wants to halt.

Unlike <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, one of the most liberal East bloc nations, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> tolerates little dissent. `` We should not give in to manifestations of negativism and inconclusiveness,'' <PERSON> Knotek </PERSON> said, blaming the `` industrial development of capitalism'' for the world's poor environmental situation. `` We can not agree with the abuse of this -LRB- ecological -RRB- process... -LRB- used -RRB- as political pressure against socialist countries, including <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> quoted him as saying <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> has been plagued by pollution from coal-fueled power plants, excessive use of pesticides resulting in high nitrogen content in the soil, and frequent oil leaks into its rivers. The daily <PERSON> Lidova </PERSON> <PERSON> Demokracie </PERSON> said Thursday the `` sickness rate'' in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> had doubled in 15 years because of air and water pollution.

<TEXT>
 The status of press freedom in the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION> is grim because of the danger journalists face in such countries as <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Inter-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> concluded Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> IAPA </ORGANIZATION> is an organization of 1,300 newspapers from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> whose main goal is to guarantee press freedom throughout the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>. About 400 <ORGANIZATION> IAPA </ORGANIZATION> members attended the four-day assembly in this industrial center in northeastern <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, 150 miles from the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> border. `` Even as representatives of the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>'s free press met in <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, the sound of gunshots fired by enemies of that free press echoed off the assembly's wall,'' the report said. Three Colombian newspaper employees and the wife of a Salvadoran journalist were gunned down Tuesday. `` While some advances are being made in nations throughout the hemisphere, the state of press freedom in the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION> still must be regarded as grim as long as journalists and their families are subject to the crudest form of censorship: death by assassination,'' the organization said in a report issued on the final day of its 45th general assembly. `` Nowhere is the struggle between the forces of darkness and the forces of light more clearly drawn than in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>,'' the <ORGANIZATION> IAPA </ORGANIZATION> said. `` There, at least 10 journalists have been murdered this year by henchmen of the cocaine cartel, at least 40 in the past 12 years,'' the report said. Although the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government is attempting to fight the drug cartels, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s leader, Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, `` is in league with the traffickers,'' the <ORGANIZATION> IAPA </ORGANIZATION> charged. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who heads <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, has closed every independent newspaper, radio and televion station and arrested, tortured or forced into exile a long list of reporters, according to the association. `` In <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, public enemy No. 1 of press freedoms in the hemisphere, repression of journalists both Cuban and foreign is worse than ever,'' the organization concluded. Meanwhile, promises of press reform by <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Sandinista government `` have not materialized,'' the <ORGANIZATION> IAPA </ORGANIZATION> said. The organization listed <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> under the `` good news category.'' <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> `` has witnessed large steps'' toward press freedoms under President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>, it said, citing the government's pledge to sell its newsprint monopoly. In the past, the government censored independent newspapers by withholding newsprint.

 Yugoslav Prime Minister <PERSON> Ante </PERSON> <PERSON> Markovic </PERSON> said Thursday that he wants $ 1 billion for his communist country's banking system to cushion the anticipated blows of economic and political reforms <PERSON> Markovic </PERSON>, whose plan to institute a market-oriented economy has been blocked by <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conservatives, said he would meet with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bankers and <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> officials to promote his request. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> is asking the 152-member <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> for a loan of $ 300 million to $ 350 million, and has reached an agreement in principle with one European country for a large loan, he said. <PERSON> Markovic </PERSON> declined to name the country, but sources said it is believed to be <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. Speaking to reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> leader said he had discussed his country's banking needs with American bankers and would bring up the problem in talks with administration officials. He meets Friday with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Markovic </PERSON>, an engineer named to his post in March, is urging the development of private enterprise and an end to government interference in the running of businesses, including a halt to subsidies of money-losing ventures. He also wants to reshape the banking system along Western lines and to introduce a stocks and bonds market.

<HEAD>NASA Says Ozone Depletion Over Antarctic Equals Record</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Depletion of ozone in the stratosphere over the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pole </LOCATION> has equalled the record level that scientists found in 1987, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. Scientists at the <ORGANIZATION> Goddard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Greenbelt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, said that satellite measurements show that ozone density over the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> has declined by about 45 percent since early August, a drop of about 1.5 percent a day. <PERSON> Arlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Krueger </PERSON>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stolarski </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoeberl </PERSON>, scientists monitoring the south polar ozone levels, said the ozone depletion recorded Oct. 5 matched the record low measured in 1987. The depletion occurs in what scientists call a `` hole'' that is formed by a high altitude formation of clouds, extreme cold and certain wind patterns over the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Polar </LOCATION> area. Such a hole can remain undisturbed for months. The the ozone depletion appears to correct itself in the polar summer, but then reappears in the cold months. `` It's becoming clear that the ozone hole is not going away in the near future, although the depth will vary from year to year,'' <PERSON> Krueger </PERSON> is quoted as saying in a news release from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> scientists have been monitoring ozone levels over the southern hemisphere using an instrument on board the NIMBUS-7 satellite for more than 10 years. Last year, ozone concentrations over <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> dropped by about 15 percent in September, about a third of the current depletion. Other studies have found some seasonal thinning of the ozone layer above the North Polar region. Ozone in the stratosphere can block much of the ultraviolet radiation from the sun. When intact, the ozone layer, in effect, prevents damaging levels of UV radiation from reaching <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. An excess exposure to UV radiation is thought to be a major cause of skin cancer, and some studies have shown that an increase in the radiation also can harm plants and the human immune system. Depletion of the concentration of ozone is thought to be increased by the interaction of certain manmade chemicals, principally cholorfluorocarbons, or CFCs, a chemical used for refrigerants and in the manufacture of some plastic products. Some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers and users of CFCs have announced plans to stop making the chemical compound or to guard against releasing the chemicals into the atmosphere. Though it is a major component of smog and an atmospheric pollutant at ground level, ozone forms an important part of the radiation protection belt surrounding the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> in the stratosphere, which begins about 9 -LCB- miles above the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and extends upward to about 39 miles. Ozone is a substance composed of three atoms of oxygen. It is created naturally during thunderstorms. Common atmospheric oxygen is composed of two atoms.

<HEAD>Survey: Smoking Decline Not Fast Enough for Federal No-Smoking Goal</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: For Release 6 p.m. EDT</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The rate of smoking among Americans continues to decline slowly but steadly, but the nation is n't likely to reach a federal goal of 75 percent non-smokers by next year, federal health officials said Thursday. A face-to-face survey of adult Americans, conducted in 1987, shows that 28.8 percent are cigarette smokers, the national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> reported. That's down from 30.1 percent in a similar 1985 survey, but the decline is apparently not enough for government researchers to project meeting the official federal goal of less than 25 percent by 1990. `` We're getting pretty close,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>'s Office of Smoking and Health. `` We're making progress, and we're heading in the right direction.'' <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> officials believed two years ago that the 1990 goal _ one of several federal health targets set as this decade began _ could be reached, partly because of a 1986 survey showing a national smoking rate of 26.5 percent. But that survey, conducted by telephone, probably was n't as precise as the face-to-face survey reported Thursday, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that smoking rates continue to fall by a steady half percentage point a year as they've done since 1964 _ the year of the surgeon general's landmark warning that smoking causes cancer and heart disease. At that time, 40 percent of the country's adults smoked. The number of Americans who smoke will continue to drop, possibly until just a small `` hard-core'' band of smokers is left, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> predicted. `` So far, we have n't seen any evidence of a leveling off -LRB- in smoking's decline -RRB-,'' he said. `` We need to intensify our efforts. ... Smokers tomorrow may be more resistant to our message than smokers today,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. `` We still have almost 400,000 Americans dying every year because of smoking-related disease. We ca n't be complacent about smoking rates going down.'' The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>'s report, based on a survey of about 44,000 people, showed that one in three adult Americans _ 39 percent of men and 27 percent of women _ uses tobacco of some sort, including cigarettes, pipes, cigars and chewing tobacco. Among men, 31 percent smoke cigarettes, compared to 27 percent of women. The report said young people are more likely to smoke cigarettes than are older people; 33 percent of Americans age 25-44 smoke, compared with 19 percent age 65-74 and 9 percent 75 and older. Five percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> adult men smoke cigars, while 3 percent smoke pipes. Four percent use chewing tobacco and 3 percent use snuff. The percentage of women using such alternate forms of tobacco was well below 1 percent. The margin of error in the survey is 1 percent for all adults, somewhat higher for subgroups.

 The farmer who found the 400-pound engine part suspected of causing a jet crash that killed 112 people learned today she will get a reward of more than $ 100,000 from <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` It's just a shock,'' said <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorenson </PERSON>, who found the piece while harvesting corn Tuesday with a combine.

GE manufactured the engine. Investigators suspect the fan disk came apart, causing the engine to disintegrate and spew shrapnel that severed the jet's hydraulic system and made the plane virtually impossible to control <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> said the company would not give the amount of the reward. But a source close to the matter said it would be about $ 130,000, and Mrs. <PERSON> Sorenson </PERSON> today said <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> told her it would be more than $ 100,000. `` I'm just in shock. I can manage $ 20,000, but this?'' she said. The amount being given is more than $ 50,000 because of all the fan blades and other parts still attached to the disk and because some other small parts found in the ground with the disk. Mrs. <PERSON> Sorenson </PERSON> said she had no immediate plans for the money. She and her husband, <PERSON> Dale </PERSON>, have lived on the farm since 1953. GE established a reward fund totaling $ 271,000 to pay for parts recovered from the crash, <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> said; less than half that amount has been paid. The disk, which looks like a windmill, was flown to a GE plant near <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> for analysis. `` We do n't know yet whether this is the golden nugget we're looking for,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> `` But we're glad we found it.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Sorenson </PERSON> found about two-thirds of the fan disk assembly, and 100 searchers hired by <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> will look for the rest of the disk and its hardware over the weekend.

 Torn between humanitarianism and trying not to offend <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the non-communist government of Premier <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> has sent conflicting signals on its policy toward illegal East German refugees. A <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> statement Thursday and a televised interview with a government spokeswoman stressed that <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> has not abandoned its treaty obligations to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to send back to its communist neighbor any East German citizens caught trying to enter <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> illegally. But in practice, the policy appears to apply only to those East Germans apprehended while trying to cross the border, not East Germans who make it deeper into <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Krysztof </PERSON> <PERSON> Skubiszewski </PERSON> said in an interview published Thursday that he opposes deportations, whether the East Germans are legal or illegal, while a border commander said earlier that if East Germans make it to the interior of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, then that is their `` luck.'' Nevertheless, the government reacted quickly to an article in the pro-Solidarity newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wyborcza </ORGANIZATION> suggesting that <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> will no longer oppose East Germans entering the country illegally. Both government spokeswoman <PERSON> Malgorzata </PERSON> <PERSON> Niezabitowska </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> still opposes illegal entries. Ms. <PERSON> Niezabitowska </PERSON> made the statement in a television appearance Wednesday night, while the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> published its statement Thursday. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> statement, troops guarding <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s frontiers have the duty of `` counteracting illegal border crossings.'' It added that repeated and widely publicized promises by <PERSON> Skubiszewski </PERSON> that no refugees would be deported against their will `` concern people who find themselves in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> legally.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> statement, apparently designed to assuage East German concerns, was conveyed to the East German public by <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s state news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION>. For practical purposes, however, East Germans who successfully cross the border area by swimming the Oder and <PERSON> Neisse </PERSON> rivers or walking across the frontier are not being interfered with by Polish officials, one border commander said. `` Obviously if someone succeeds in crossing the border and gets deeper into Polish territory, then it is his luck and we do not care about him,'' said Gen. <PERSON> Feliks </PERSON> <PERSON> Stramik </PERSON>, of the Military Border Guard, interviewed by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday. <PERSON> Skubiszewski </PERSON>, in an interview Thursday in <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wyborcza </ORGANIZATION>, noted that all over the world people who enter a country illegally are liable to deportation. `` But that is not the point,'' the foreign minister said. `` I still believe that deportations should not be taking place. I have tried hard to prevent them.'' Without specifying his efforts, he said his aim was to solve the problem `` in accordance with <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s duties in the field of human rights but also in accordance with the interests of the state.'' He said state interests `` should be handled so as to avoid harming the individual.'' <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>'s government has several reasons to be sensitive to the concerns of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. When it took power as the first non-communist government in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc, it gave assurances that <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> would continue to respect foreign policy commitments within the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact. Also, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> spans the direct roads between <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and East German authorities could easily play havoc with Polish tourism and commerce. <PERSON> Skubiszewski </PERSON> pointed to the fact that many Poles are employed in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> `` and we must also take their interests into account.'' <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> has taken a tolerant view to the 600 East Germans who have made their way to the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> in the past week. Unlike their counterparts in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, the refugees have not been forced to reside on the embassy grounds but instead in vacation hotels. Both the Roman Catholic church and the <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> have been active in caring for the refugees. Two trainloads carrying more than 1,400 refugees were allowed to leave <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> last week with the agreement of the East German government.

 Cable News Network pulled the plug on unchallenged commentaries, including the wry observations of <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellerbee </PERSON>, in an unexplained `` management decision,'' <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> spokesmen said Thursday. Commentaries on <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION>'s discussion programs, and the opposing views expressed on them, will continue on the 24-hour schedule. Those programs are `` Crossfire,'' `` <ORGANIZATION> Evans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Novak'' and the `` Capitol Gang.'' <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> gave no reason for the end Monday to free-standing commentaries, including those of <PERSON> Ellerbee </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Novak </PERSON>, <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> <PERSON> Schramm </PERSON>, weatherman Flip Spiceland and sportscaster <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Huber </PERSON>. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Haworth </PERSON>, a spokesman at <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, said `` it was just a management decision.''

A recent editorial in The Morning News Tribune in <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, criticized a <LOCATION> Spiceland </LOCATION> commentary in which the weatherman said women's logic `` is one of those contradictory terms like military intelligence.'' <PERSON> Haworth </PERSON> would not comment on reports that <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, who owns <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> parent Turner Broadcasting System, ordered the end of unchallenged commentaries after the editorial.

 Federal safety investigators said today they had found an apparently pre-existing crack in the engine disk discovered in an <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> corn field nearly three months after the crash of an airliner that killed 112 people. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON>, acting chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, said the precise `` size, nature and reason for the crack'' has yet to be determined. `` There has been no determination on whether this crack was detectable before the accident, nor has there been a determination whether this crack is the point of origin of engine failure,'' said board spokesman <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopatkiewicz </PERSON>. He said it had not been determined whether the crack should have been caught in the last engine inspection before the crash He and <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON> said, however that preliminary evidence indicates the crack existed prior to the July 19 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> crash at <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. The middle engine in the DC-10 disintegrated in flight, severing hydraulic lines and making the plane almost impossible to steer. The craft cartwheeled out of control as the pilots were trying to make an emergency landing.

 The light illuminating the huge red star atop parliament was switched off Thursday and will be removed, the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> reported. The announcement was preceded by a decision to gradually remove the red star emblem from all public buildings and replace it with national symbols. The removal of the red star from parliament would take place in the first half of 1990 and will cost a considerable sum of money, `` since safe removal will be a complicated technical operation requiring specific arrangements,'' <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> said. It did not elaborate. The decision followed a last weekend's vote to disband the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and form a Western-style <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> advocating political pluralism and private enterprise.

 A short circuit, lasting about 1 1 @ 2 seconds, caused some sparks and smoke on the middeck of the space shuttle <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> on its flight in August, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. `` There is no ndication the astronauts were ever in any danger,'' said <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Keegan </PERSON>. The space agency confirmed a report, broadcast by <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, that the crew handled the short circuit by unplugging a teleprinter. The cause, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said, appeared to be damage to insulation on a cable that connected the printer to the spaceship's electrical system A redesigned cable has been installed aboard Atlantis for the <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> space probe mission next week. The covering has been changed to Teflon to make it more flexible, Miss <PERSON> Keegan </PERSON> said. The shuttle, with five astronauts aboard, was on a military mission on the Aug. 8-13 flight and the crew maintained radio silence throughout. `` The crew reported seeing some sparks and some smoke was recorded by one of the cabin smoke detectors,'' <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said in a response prepared for questions that were raised about the incident in late August. `` While the detector recorded the smoke twice, it was not enough to sound the alarm aboard the orbiter,'' <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said. `` There is no evidence that the short was caused by the teleprinter in any way. The most likely cause is physical damage to the cable conductor insulation material.''

 King <PERSON> Moshoeshoe </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION> on Thursday urged the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to press <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to allow leaders of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to attend power-sharing talks hosted by his tiny kingdom. <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION>, a small landlocked enclave within <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, is exploring a plan to host talks between the black majority and the white minority government of the larger nation, he said. `` <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION> is well positioned to play a role in the process of facilitating reconciliation between the people of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' he told reporters. In his meetings with Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and top <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials, <PERSON> Moshoeshoe </PERSON> said he would ask that `` pressure be brought to bear'' on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to allow safe passage into <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION> of the exiled <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> leadership from neighboring African states. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> blockaded <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION> in 1986, saying it was trying to prevent the smuggling of <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas and weapons into the kingdom. The strained relations with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> resulted in a military coup that overthrew the left-leaning prime minister <PERSON> Leabua </PERSON> <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> later that year. <PERSON> Moshoeshoe </PERSON> governs in consultation with the military council, which holds most of the power and is on better terms with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> than he is. `` Our opposition to apartheid is without compromise,'' he said. While recent steps announced by newly elected President F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> to release political prisoners and allow blacks more freedom are welcome, he said, `` apartheid can not be reformed.'' The government must free all political prisoners, legalize opposition movements and allow banned black leaders to return from exile, he said. <PERSON> Moshoeshoe </PERSON> also said international pressure on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> must be kept up, but he cautioned that economic sanctions are also damaging to the economies of <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION> and other so-called front-line states that border <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION> is completely surrounded by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and totally dependent on it for its survival. The British-educated monarch said he was seeking foreign investment in the kingdom so that its 1.5 million people could shake off their dependence on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Pentagon: Soviet Bloc Aid to Nicargua Increasing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> apparently `` approved and may be orchestrating'' delivery of Soviet bloc weapons and equipment to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> despite pledges to halt its own shipments of weapons, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials said Thursday. `` If present trends continue, 1989 could exceed 1988 in total tonnage and dollar value of <LOCATION> Sovet </LOCATION> bloc military shipments to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said in a report. Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in May that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had suspended weapons shipments to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> at the end of 1988. However, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has sent the leftist government in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> some $ 500 million in various other forms of military aid this year, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have said. `` Evidence is circumstantial, but we believe the Soviets have approved and may be orchestrating the delivery of Soviet block lethal aid to the Sandinistas through <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said. `` It is unlikely that either the Eastern bloc nations or <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> would act on their own _ in contravention of clearly articulated <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> policy _ to boost military shipments to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said that during the first nine months of this year, Soviet military deliveries are `` down by about 50 percent, but Eastern bloc deliveries have increased by about 35 percent, essentially offsetting the decrease.'' In addition, deliveries from <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> _ primarily of small arms and ammunition _ are `` almost double the amount delivered in the same period in 1988,'' the report said. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said it does n't believe <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has the capability of producing the quantities of weapons being shipped to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. While some could be from Cuban stocks, the report said, `` we judge that for the most part these arms and ammunition are being transshipped from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> through <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>.'' Since the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> peace accords were signed in August 1987, the report said the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have received `` some 36,500 metric tons of Soviet bloc military aid valued at $ 1.045 billion,'' allowing <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> to field the `` largest and most powerful armed force in Central America.'' The Eastern bloc shipments include surface-to-air missiles, armed transport helicopters, a MI-25 HIND attack helicopter, North Korean patrol boats and `` a record number of vehicles, including radar and communications trucks,'' the report said. The study strikes a discordant note amid the thaw in U.S.-Soviet relations, which appeared particularly upbeat after the <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> meeting last month between Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. `` Our problem has to do with an increase in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> bloc </LOCATION> weapons and military equipment going into <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, going into <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, quite frankly, and from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- guerrillas -RRB- in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said after the meeting. `` Most of that is coming from <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, and we would simply like to see the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> do as much as it possibly could with <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> to stop that flow.'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> after the <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> session, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said they understood he tried to use his influence to reduce the flow of weapons and equipment. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> report reflects a review of shipments from 1979 until Oct. 1, and would therefore not reflect any change since <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s visit. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> continues to arm `` far in excess of its legitimate defensive needs'' and apparently intends to beef up its military stores and use the supplies against Contra forces, as well as to support rebels in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> leader Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the report said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> halted its shipments to the Contras in February.

<HEAD>Remains of Shakespeare's Globe Under Parking Lot &amp; Hazelnuts</HEAD>

 Beneath a parking lot, under a mulch of hazelnuts perhaps left by snacking drama patrons, archaeologists believe they have found the remains of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s Globe Theater. `` Certainty is a scarce commodity in archaeology but the probability is very high,'' said <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON>, a senior archaeologist at the Museum of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. `` Essentially, this is the site where the <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> ought to lie.'' A plaque put up nearby in 1909 by the <ORGANIZATION> Shakespeare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> identified the likely site of the most famous Elizabethan theater on the south bank of the <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Thames </LOCATION>. The site is by <LOCATION> Southwark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> and two-thirds of a mile east of the National Theater. On Thursday, the hopes of <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> lovers were rewarded with the first glimpses of three chalk and brick foundation walls that <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> said were part of the back of the theater. `` Finding the theater as a marker is very important,'' he said. `` Clearly, the importance in terms of scholarship can only come from investigation.'' The Globe was built in 1599 by <PERSON> Cuthbert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Burbage </PERSON> and a company of actors, including <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>. Little was known about the shape except that it was described as `` this wooden O'' in the prologue to <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s `` <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> said: `` If you look at the outline -LRB- of the remains -RRB- from the top, you'll see it is actually beginning to make the O shape or the polygonal shape.'' A second piece of evidence was the discovery of a large quantity of crushed hazelnut shells near one wall, he said. Hazelnuts were the Elizabethan equivalent of popcorn, and <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> said the shells appear to have been used as a building material, possibly to level the theater's floors. The <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> became one of the most popular theaters of its day and saw the first performances of <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s great tragedies `` Hamlet,'' `` Othello,'' `` King Lear'' and `` Macbeth.'' During the first performance of <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s `` <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> VIII </PERSON>'' on June 29, 1613, a cannon that discharged set fire to the theater and it was destroyed. The only injury, according to a contemporary account by Sir <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wotten </PERSON>, was to a man whose breeches caught fire but had the `` provident wit -LRB- to -RRB- put it out with bottle ale.'' The Globe was rebuilt the following year on the old foundations, and again was a hit with audiences who paid 1 pence for the pit, 2 pence for the gallery and 3 pence for a seat. The most privileged members of the audience sat on stools on the stage. But the Puritans, who were against public displays, helped push an ordinance through <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in 1642 banning stage plays, and the <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> was closed, along with other theaters. It was demolished two years later. Archaeologists knew the general location of the <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> but it was the sale three years ago of the Courage brewery by owners <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> to the British conglomerate <ORGANIZATION> Hanson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> that led to the excavation of the brewery's parking lot this summer. <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> said the remains were discovered in the northwest corner of the lot, the last section on the 21,500-square-foot site to be cleared of concrete reinforced with metal. To the untrained eye, the corner site near the south end of <LOCATION> Southwark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> looks like a deep hole with the remains of concrete pillars and rows of bricks. With help from <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON>, one can spot an outer brick wall. A middle wall 3 yards long and made of gray-white chalk blocks is believed to be part of the first Globe theater, while an inner brick wall, 1 yard long and with a layer of crushed hazelnuts, may be part of the second Globe, he said. The three surviving wall foundations cover an area 10 yards by 6 yards and form the eastern part of the theater. But archaeologists say most of the theater lies beyond the edge of the parking lot excavation under early 19th century row houses also owned by <ORGANIZATION> Hanson </ORGANIZATION>, which are under historic preservation orders. Earlier this year, archaeologists excavated a sister Elizabethan theater, the Rose, less than 100 yards away. Actors and historians campaigned against a developer's plans to cover it up and it is being partially preserved. <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>, whose company contributed $ 390,000 to support the latest dig, said the <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION>'s remains would be preserved for public display. Asked whether the row houses might be torn down to excavate the rest of the <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Shea </PERSON> said: `` I think that's very much for the conservationists to argue over and I think we'll stand back and watch them decide.'' American film actor-director <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Wanamaker </PERSON>, who is building a $ 31 million reconstruction of the <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> about 200 yards away, watched the archaeologists work and said: `` We're absolutely thrilled.'' He said the reconstruction was suspended in hopes that discoveries by the archaeologists will help him build a more faithful replica of the Bard's playhouse.

 A bar fight exploded into a brawling rampage involving hundreds of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and British seamen that left cars overturned, windows smashed and more than 100 people injured, police said Thursday. Police said they arrested 121 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> sailors after an estimated 500 seamen and scores of police brawled Wednesday night along <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>'s seedy, bar-dotted dockside. The sailors were released to their ships Thursday morning and a British aircraft carrier cut short a courtesy call and left for home because of the fighting. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy officials insisted that most if not all injuries were caused by police. <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> police said sailors fought among themselves, then turned on officers trying to break up the melees. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said 142 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sailors were treated for injuries. He said 40 sailors had to be hospitalized for injuries such as damaged spleens or possible concussions. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said the brawl was being investigated but that there were several versions of what he called `` a very confused situation.'' <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> police said four police officers and three civilians were among the injured. <PERSON> Paulino </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardoso </PERSON>, duty officer at <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>'s security police, said the melee broke out after three black American seamen attacked a white <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sailor at the Passport Bar in the gaudy, neon-lighted <LOCATION> Cais </LOCATION> do <LOCATION> Sodre </LOCATION> area. That account could not be confirmed. A <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official who asked not to be identified said the injured included officers, a chaplain and intelligence officers who were trying to calm a confrontation that arose when police tried to clear an area of sailors following some type of disturbance. The official said there were reports that indicated police were responsible for `` severe indiscriminate beatings.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy information officer <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Liefkowitz </PERSON> said: `` All the 142 injuries treated seem to have resulted from clashes with the police.'' A <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION> public security police force spokesman, Lt. <PERSON> Pereira </PERSON> <PERSON> Chumbinho </PERSON>, did not deny force was used. But he said sailors `` maltreated'' the first two police crews to arrive on the scene, then surrounded a third vehicle. `` Then we had to send in three more cars and more forces, but it is sure that the sailors were fighting among themselves and then turned on the police,'' he said. Fighting spread from bar to nightclub along the narrow, cobbled streets of the riverside area about 9 p.m., <PERSON> Cardoso </PERSON> said. He said British seamen from the aircraft carrier <ORGANIZATION> Ark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION>, which arrived in <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION> on Wednesday on a five-day goodwill visit, joined in the brawling. Ark Royal Commander <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said only a few <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> sailors had been `` caught up'' in the fighting. `` There is no evidence of fighting between <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> sailors ... and I am confident my men were not involved in any drunkenness, damage or trouble of any kind,'' Ark Royal Capt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Brigstocke </PERSON> later told reporters. <PERSON> Cardoso </PERSON> said <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> sailors had been arrested with the Americans. Shore leave was canceled from the Ark Royal and aboard the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assault craft <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Barnstable </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Shreveport </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ships were in <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION> during a break from <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> exercises off the Portuguese coast and slated to leave Oct. 20. <PERSON> Brigstocke </PERSON> said the Ark Royal was cutting short its courtesy call to <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION> and departed today for <LOCATION> Portsmouth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. `` It was very confused _ there were police cars driving one way, and sailors running the other, but we had no trouble,'' said an employee at the nearby <LOCATION> Hatari </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bar </LOCATION>, who asked not to be identified. `` It was just like <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Blues </LOCATION>,'' said a shopkeeper. Cars were turned over, windows were smashed and about 40 sailors were arrested when they stormed the local police station, <LOCATION> Portugese </LOCATION> police said.

 The federal government lacks an overall strategy for handling the huge amounts of scientific and technical information generated by government agencies, the congressional <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assessment </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. An <ORGANIZATION> OTA </ORGANIZATION> study observed that in the earth and space sciences alone, it is estimated that federal agencies are managing a data archive of roughly 100,000 gigabytes, the equivalent of about 45 billion pages of text. Developing an overall strategy for scientific and technical information is needed, the congressional office said, if the potential of new electronic technologies is to be fully realized. It said technologies such as online electronic databases or high-density optical disks and magnetic cartridges offer `` great promise'' for timely, cost-effective storage and dissemination of the federal government's information. `` Electronic technologies offer the only real hope for managing the already massive federal archives of scientific data and documents,'' the <ORGANIZATION> OTA </ORGANIZATION> report said. It noted that federal science agencies and interagency coordinating groups have made some progress in a variety of areas related to handling scientific and technical information. `` While these modest achievements were adequate for the earlier stages of the transition to a competitive, electronic environment, bolder initiatives are now necessary,'' the congressional agency said. It recommended expanding the role of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy in dealing with scientific and technical information, as well as improving coordination between that office and the presidential <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted final, overwhelming approval Thursday for a federal ban on flag burning, just four months after a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision allowing destruction of an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag as political protest. `` This is the least we can do to protect the sanctity of the flag,'' Rep. <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> <PERSON> Derrick </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, said before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted, 371-43, to approve the bill. However, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and many Republicans say <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> must do more than pass a mere statute, and they have been pressing for a constitutional amendment to outlaw flag destruction or desecration. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will take up that issue next week. Still, 154 Republicans joined 217 Democrats in supporting the statutory ban on Thursday, while only 18 Republicans and 25 Democrats opposed it. The bill passed the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> 91-9. White House Press Secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had not yet received the bill but when it arrives `` we'll have to have a legal review take place. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> declined to say whether <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would veto it or sign it. However, administration sources speaking on condition of anonymity, said the president was expected to let it go into effect without his signature. `` The president obviously agrees with its general purpose but feels a constitutional amendment is required to survive legal challenges,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said of the bill. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said last week that a new statute would not be adequate to get around the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision, which threw out the conviction of a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> flag burner. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> backed earlier congressional proposals for a constitutional amendment but <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> scrapped them in favor of the legislative approach. The bill on its way to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would revise existing federal law and provide up to a year in a jail and a $ 1,000 fine for anyone who `` knowingly mutilates, defaces, physically defiles, burns, maintains on the floor or ground, or tramples upon any flag of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' The one-sided votes in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> reflected the power of the flag as a political symbol, as demonstrated by a public outcry following the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision in June. <PERSON> Derrick </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> that the court's decision, throwing out the conviction of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> flag burner <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> on grounds that his right to free speech was violated, hit Americans like `` a slap in the face.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> joined the call for a constitutional amendment, but <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders said changing the Constitution would be too drastic an action in response to an isolated case. `` Amending the Constitution as some would advance should be a last resort and not a first resort,'' said Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N </LOCATION>. He said the issue should `` be addressed in a much less dramatic manner.'' However, House Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., said, `` To those who believe we can overturn a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision at this time by statute, I can only repeat the immortal words of the farmer who, asked directions, said, ` you ca n't get there from here.' Supporters of the bill approved Thursday said the wording had been carefully fashioned to withstand court challenges, banning flag defacement regardless of whether it involved political protest. `` It is the act of harming the physical integrity of the flag rather than any message that the action might convey that is to be punished,'' <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> said the bill has been framed in a `` content neutral manner.'' But that idea drew scoffing from some Republicans, who said that any bill to ban flag burning by simple statute would be overturned for the same reasons as the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> case. `` Approval of this bill will send a fatally flawed statute ... to the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sensenbrenner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wis </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sensenbrenner </PERSON> pointed in particular to an amendment attached by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> last week at the urging of Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif It added the words `` physically defiles'' to the list of prohibited acts. Critics said anyone who physically defiled the flag would obviously have an attitude toward it and thus the measure would end up punishing political protest, no matter how carefully sponsors may have sought to avoid it. As in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, many <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers clearly planned to vote for both the bill and the constitutional amendment, a strategy considered politically safe. A number of Republicans who voted against the bill, calling it inadequate, were joined by a smattering of Democrats who said that neither the amendment nor the bill should be approved.

<TEXT>
 The board of directors of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> approved a 1990 general assessment increase of 4.9 percent for newspaper and broadcast members. The increase takes effect Jan. 14, 1990, for <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>'s 1,705 newspaper and 5,800 broadcast members. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> board chairman and chief executive officer of the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said the increase was needed to help pay for new services for the members, necessary staff additions and election year expenses, as well as other new costs. <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> noted that for the fourth year in a row, the increase was less than next year's predicted rate of inflation. `` Tight cost controls and growing revenues from non-traditional sources enabled the board to limit the increase and continue to improve service,'' <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> said. `` Those other sources now contribute 22 percent of our revenue.'' <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>'s proposed operating and capital budgets were examined by the board on a detailed, line-by-line basis. The budgets provide for launching of <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>'s high speed photo delivery system, PhotoStream; expansion, installation and training for the new SelectStocks market services; and other new products for <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> members. The general assessment increase will be combined with another step in the phase-in of the circulation-based newspaper formula for those members that have not yet reached their appropriate assessment level. The 1990 assessment will also reflect any circulation changes at the member newspaper. Each member will receive exact figures on the assessment change by Nov. 1, <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Lawmaker, Experts Criticize Grain Reserve Depletion</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> lawmaker and food-supply experts said Thursday that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's depletion of grain reserves has artificially held down prices and taken away the nation's buffer against shortages. `` It appears to me ... that the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> has intentionally used our reserve programs to soften the price of wheat,'' Rep. <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorgan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.D. </LOCATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feed grains. Prices, he said, are shaped by supply and supply is determined by the amount of grain in the fields, granaries and the pipeline. `` <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> used the reserve grain to keep the pipeline full, so even though the supply in the granaries is dwindling, the pipeline remains full and millers and exporters do n't have to look far for wheat,'' <PERSON> Dorgan </PERSON> said. But with reserves dwindling, the price-stabilizing buffer is nearly gone, said <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nutrition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a consumer group. `` Grain and food prices in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and the world have been relatively stable over the past three years only because the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> had unintentionally built an enormous stockpile of wheat, corn and feed grain,'' <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' emergency grain reserve of 4 million tons of wheat, or about 170 million bushels, will be gone by next spring, he said. `` Secretary of Agriculture <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>, who is guardian of this reserve, released it last month, but under circumstances that hardly qualify as an emergency for which the reserve was designed,'' <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> told the subcommittee. On Sept. 13, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> gave wheat farmers permission to increase production for 1990 to allow the government to replenish wheat reserves. The next day, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> would have the authority to take grain out of reserve for food aid. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said that in the past food-aid needs have been supplied by the open market and benefited farmers by causing prices to go up. The administration's action, however, kept prices from rising. `` It is our judgment that the flexibility in the management of reserves has been overdone,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Reeves </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> farmer and policy analyst for Bread for the World, a 40,000 member <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> organization that wants to help alleviate world hunger. `` We are distressed at the more recent drawdown of reserve stocks to levels we regard as risky, if not dangerous,'' he said. <PERSON> Dorgan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reeves </PERSON> were among witnesses called by subcommittee chairman Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON>, D-Kan., in his effort to formulate a policy for use of grain reserves that could become part of the 1990 farm bill Neither <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> nor the White House has determined the specific purpose of withholding grain, leading the reserves to be used for a variety of things, such as emergency aid to foreign countries, feed for livestock in time of drought, export subsidies or manipulation of market prices.

<HEAD>House Wants CIA To Hand Over Classified Reports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The House Thursday asserted a right to delve into <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> classified investigation reports as part of its responsibility to oversee the agency. The action came in a bill authorizing activities of the nation's intelligence agencies for fiscal 1990, which began Oct. 1 The overall bill, most of which is classified, was approved on a vote of 369-31. While the total amount the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> spends on intelligence activities is secret, reports put the figure at somewhat more than $ 25 billion. Most of the money is tucked away in various Pentagon accounts and covers everything from personnel and spy hardware, such as satellites, to covert operations overseas. Language in the bill would require the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> to submit to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> intelligence committees twice a year a list of all investigation and audit reports prepared by the agency's inspector general and to turn over any report requested by either committee. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration contends the requirement is an unconstitutional intrusion on its authority and could jeopardize the confidentiality of investigative reports. Administration officials say the provision would be cause for a veto. The provision is the result of a long-running dispute between the spy agency and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurdy </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., said the committee voted unanimously to slap the new requirements on the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, `` not so we can mount a fishing expedition, but to assess the adequacy'' of the agency's own internal controls House access to <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> investigative reports has been `` a matter of some sensitivity'' to Director of Central Intelligence <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>, <PERSON> McCurdy </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is at work on its own version of the bill, which would make the agency's inspector general more like the independent auditors at other federal agencies, including a requirement that the person be confirmed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. That version of the bill is expected to be sent to the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> next week, and differences in the two bills will ultimately have to be worked out in House-Senate negotiations. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel has not had the same difficulties as its House counterpart in gaining access to investigation reports, according to a committee aide. Dealing with another issue that has been contentious, the committee built safeguards into the bill to prevent the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration from funneling any covert aid to political opponents of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist Sandinista government. No money could be used for such an effort unless the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> first seeks permission from the Intelligence and Appropriations committees in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The administration is separately seeking $ 9 million in above-board aid to strengthen the election process and enhance the opposition's chances in next February's elections. Rep. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolpe </PERSON>, D-Mich., also used the occasion to question continued <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for the <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> rebels, which now amounts to $ 40 million <PERSON> Wolpe </PERSON> alleged that <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> has sought to torpedo efforts to foster peace between his forces and the Marxist Angolan government, and said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has failed to adopt a new policy that recognizes shifting conditions in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` The African heads of state involved are showing less and less confidence in American intentions,'' <PERSON> Wolpe </PERSON> said.

 Farmers are harvesting a corn crop estimated at 7.45 billion bushels, up 51 percent from last year's drought-plagued harvest of 4.92 billion bushels, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday Moreover, the latest estimate, based on Oct. 1 field surveys, was almost 2 percent more than the 7.32 billion bushels forecast a month ago. At 7.45 billion bushels the harvest would be the largest since the 8.25 billion bushels of 1986. The record was the 1985 crop of nearly 8.9 billion bushels. `` The crop is being harvested at a slower rate than normal due to the lateness of the crop in some states,'' the department's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported `` By Oct. 1, 16 percent of the crop had been harvested in the 19 major producing states, compared with 34 percent last year and the average of 22 percent.'' Corn yields were estimated at 114.4 bushels per acre harvested, up from 112.4 forecast in September and 84.6 bushels in 1988 but still below the record of 119.4 bushels per acre in 1987. As livestock feed, corn is the largest and most important <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm crop. It is an essential ingredient for the production of meat, poultry and dairy products. Consumer food prices, which rose an average of 4.1 percent in 1988, are expected to go up 5 percent to 7 percent this year, according to department economists. Soybean production, a source of high-protein meal and vegetable oil, was estimated at 1.93 billion bushels, up 24 percent from last year's harvest of 1.54 billion bushels and 2 percent above the September estimate of 1.89 billion bushels. Yields were estimated at an average of 32.6 bushels per acre this year, compared with 26.8 bushels in 1988 and the September forecast of 32 bushels. The record was 34.1 bushels per acre in 1985. Despite the greatly improved yields of major crops, parts of the country still suffer from long-term effects of the 1988 drought. And that raises questions about future harvests. `` We always start looking ahead to next year, and we're not out of the woods yet, in the sense that in lots of places the subsoil moisture is not normal,'' said private analyst <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Motes </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Sparks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. But he added that `` the only thing that it really means at this point is that the risk is a little higher than in a normal year, the risk of a shortfall'' in 1990. The revised estimates showed total wheat production at 2.04 billion bushels, up 13 percent from last year, but 1 percent below the September forecast of 2.06 billion bushels. Wheat yields were estimated to average 32.9 bushels per harvested acre, compared with 34.1 bushels in 1988. The October yield was unchanged from September but the acreage for harvest was reduced 1 percent. The record yield was 39.4 bushels in 1983. Winter wheat production, which accounts for about three-fourths of the total, was estimated at 1.45 billion bushels, 1 percent less than the previous forecast made in August and repeated in September. That was down 7 percent from 1988. Yields averaged 35.1 bushels per acre, up from 35 bushels indicated previously but down from 39.2 last year. Production of durum wheat, which is planted in the spring, was indicated at 92.9 million bushels, up 107 percent from last year's drought-ravaged harvest but down 1 percent from the September estimate Other spring wheat was shown at 497 million bushels, up 142 percent from the 1988 harvest but down 1 percent from September. Cotton production was indicated at 12 million bales, down 22 percent from last year's output and 2 percent below the September estimate of 12.3 million bales. The yield was estimated at 603 pounds per acre, down 16 pounds from 1988 and 15 pounds below the September forecast. In a related report on supply and demand for major commodities, analysts said total corn use in the 1989-90 marketing year that began on Sept. 1 is still expected to be around 7.5 billion bushels, including domestic and export requirements. With demand exceeding 1989 corn production, that will mean a further drawdown of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stockpiles to about 1.88 billion bushels left over by next Sept. 1, down from inventories estimated at 1.93 billion bushels at the beginning of the marketing year. Even so, that represents only a slight dip in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn stockpile, compared with last season's decline, when it plummeted from 4.26 billion bushels on Sept. 1, 1988 to the 1.93 billion bushels on hand this Sept. 1. The report said corn prices may average in the range of $ 1.85 to $ 2.25 per bushel in the 1989-90 marketing year, down from $ 2.54 last season, unchanged from the September report. Other 1989 crop estimates based on Oct. 1 indications, compared with 1988 output, included: _ Sorghum, 656.7 million bushels and an average yield of 62.4 bushels per acre, compared with 577.6 million and 63.8 in 1988 _ Rice, 155.1 million hundredweight and a yield of 5,649 pounds per acre, compared with 159.5 million and 5,511 _ Peanuts, 4.34 billion pounds and a yield of 2,639 pounds per acre, compared with 3.98 billion and 2,445 _ Tobacco, 1.48 billion pounds and a yield of 2,122 pounds per acre, compared with 1.37 billion and 2,160 _ Sugarbeets, 26.6 million tons and a yield of 20.1 tons per acre, compared with 24.8 million and 19.1 _ Sugarcane, 30.5 million tons and a yield of 35.2 tons per acre, compared with 29.9 million and 35.4

<HEAD>Small School Buses Could Be Safer, Board Says</HEAD>

 More safety features are needed on the nation's 41,000 small school buses to protect children in accidents, the head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON>, acting board chairman, said an 18-month investigation into the buses that make up 10 percent to 15 percent of the total school bus fleet shows that injuries to students in accidents generally have been minor. `` But the board believes that improvements can be made,'' <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON> said in discussing the report adopted by the board Wednesday night. Crash-sled tests and federal standards are needed to increase protection of children in front-row seats of smaller school buses, the board concluded. The report found small buses to be generally safe but called for improved front-door latches and windshield retention and several tests to determine whether tough standards for larger buses should be extended to those built to carry between 10 and 24 children. The board said that although school buses remain one of the safest of all forms of transportation, some smaller buses have been modified in ways that increase the chance of injury in a crash, particularly to children sitting in the front row. `` In some cases, passenger lapbelts and other restraints had been installed ... in a manner inconsistent with federal standards for seatbelts, diminishing crash protection and increasing the potential to induce injury,'' the board said in its findings. `` In multi-vehicle crashes and other crash scenarios, small school buses lack the built-in crash advantage of superior size and weight provided by large school buses,'' the board concluded. But it said investigation of 24 accidents involving the smaller buses showed that they `` generally provided good crash protection to both restrained and unrestrained passengers.'' Safety belts are customarily provided for passengers in small buses, but the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> staff said not all students are using them, and lap-only belts in the front seat may add to the danger of injury in some crashes. The board two years ago recommended against seat belts in larger buses, preferring that seats be designed so they, in effect, form padded compartments around youthful riders. The board rejected earlier staff recommendations for full-scale crash tests on small school buses. Some officials argued that the low level of injuries and relatively small number of deaths _ about two a year _ in small bus crashes does not require such a complex study. The tests proposed would be conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and include computer simulation and crash sleds. The sled tests involve seats, barriers and dummies attached to a sled that approximates conditions in a crash. Board spokeswoman <PERSON> Drucella </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> said the tests could not duplicate conditions in an entire bus but would show the effects on children in the front seat and test the effectiveness of various seatbelt and barrier designs. The board also voted to call for testing to determine the need for stronger roofs and joints. It said roofs in the smaller buses are less able to withstand rollover forces and body joints are exempt from federal joint strength standards that pply to larger buses. The board in August sent back the staff study for revisions after failing to resolve questions over testing of front-seat barriers and seatbelt use in the buses.

 <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and union officials agreed Thursday to have mediators intervene in a 10-week-old strike involving 60,000 telephone workers. `` We're looking optimistically on this since we've been asking for months and months to have -LRB- a mediator -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Adele </PERSON> <PERSON> Stacy </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>. She said unions first requested an independent mediator Aug. 3 but telephone company officials had resisted the idea until reversing their stance Thursday. `` All parties acknowledge that it is in the best interest of employees and customers to bring the strike to a conclusion as quickly as possible,'' the company and unions said in a joint statment. Officials for both sides said further details regarding scheduled meetings and progress in the mediation process would be jointly announced. It was not immediately clear whether discussions would be conducted on a state or federal level, officials said. Negotiators had arrived at a standoff Wednesday after talks abruptly broke off under conditions each side blamed on the other. <ORGANIZATION> IBEW </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> said union officials were developing a counterproposal to the latest offer by <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, when they were told the company would not consider an alternative. But <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION>, offered a different version. He said union officials had been `` unresponsive to the needs of its striking members'' and failed to show up for talks Wednesday on the `` improved'' proposal offered by the company. That proposal was laid on the table Tuesday in the first bargaining session held this month. Workers walked off the job Aug. 6 after contract discussions broke down over salary and health care issues. The <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, which represents 40,000 workers at <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, and the <ORGANIZATION> IBEW </ORGANIZATION>, whose 20,000 workers are at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> Telephone, struck over <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION>'s insistence that the workers pay up to $ 1,500 a year in health care costs. Negotiations have progressed slowly or not at all since employees walked off the job, leaving customers throughout <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with delays in directory assistance, repairs and installation. Strikes that broke out in several other regional telephone companies were settled in relatively quick order.

<HEAD>Bush Nominee Admits Mishandling Drug Use Probe at Nuclear Plant</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s nominee to head the government's nuclear weapons program acknowledged Thursday he had mishandled an allegation of illegal drug use at a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> atomic power plant during his tenure as a nuclear regulator. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Stello </PERSON> defended his record as chief of staff at the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and denied allegations that he was more interested in carrying out personal vendettas than ensuring safety at nuclear plants. `` I am convinced that I acted in the best interest of safety and responsible management,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on oversight and investigations. Under intense questioning by Rep. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kostmayer </PERSON>, D-Pa., the panel chairman, <PERSON> Stello </PERSON> said he now believed he had waited too long to act on an August 1988 allegation by a former worker at the <LOCATION> Nine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> nuclear station near <LOCATION> Oswego </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, of illegal drug use there <PERSON> Stello </PERSON> admitted he did not order an investigation of the charge, which eventually was dismissed, until late March 1989, despite the serious safety issues it raised. `` We should have pursued that earlier,'' <PERSON> Stello </PERSON> said, adding that he kept the allegation secret because he feared the disclosure would compromise an internal <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> investigation based on other allegations from the same informant, <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON>. Some of those other allegations were targeted at <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Fortuna </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> criminal investigator, whom <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> accused of failing to fully investigate his earlier allegations of criminal violations at Nine Mile Point. <PERSON> Kostmayer </PERSON> claimed Stello's goal in the internal investigation was to press the allegations against <PERSON> Fortuna </PERSON> as a way of discrediting him and curbing the independence of <ORGANIZATION> Fortuna </ORGANIZATION>'s Office of Investigations. At the same time, <PERSON> Kostmayer </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Stello </PERSON> was hindering the separate probe of safety conditions at the plant. `` You are so wrong,'' Stello said. `` I stand by what I did and accept full responsibility for it.'' Stello acknowledged, however, that he should have acted on the drug charge more quickly because one of the two reactors at Nine Mile Point was operating at the time. The allegation was of drug use at the idled reactor, but <PERSON> Stello </PERSON> acknowledged that many employees at the station perform work in both reactor buildings. <PERSON> Stello </PERSON> said he was willing to accept <PERSON> Kostmayer </PERSON>'s accusation that he had acted `` stupidly.'' Some environmental groups are vigorously campaigning on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> to block <PERSON> Stello </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation as assistant energy secretary for defense programs, whose main responsibility is to manage the troubled nuclear arms program. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has not yet scheduled a committee hearing to consider Stello's nomination, which was announced by the White House July 24. Stello is now on loan from the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> to Energy Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> as a special adviser and has been heading up efforts to restart the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION> -RRB- nuclear reactors, which make a gas vital to production of nuclear warheads. <PERSON> Kostmayer </PERSON> did not mention <PERSON> Stello </PERSON>'s nomination to the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> post during Thursday's hearing, but the ranking Republican on the panel, Rep. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vucanovich </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, said later she believed the main purpose of holding the hearing was to attempt to discredit <PERSON> Stello </PERSON> and block his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation. Instead of inquiring about whether <PERSON> Stello </PERSON> was carrying out personal vendettas at the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>, `` it seems to me it's more of a vendetta on Mr. <PERSON> Kostmayer </PERSON>'s part,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Vucanovich </PERSON> said in an interview. `` It's certainly against Mr. Stello.'' <PERSON> Stello </PERSON> said in an interview during a break in his testimony that he, too, suspected that <PERSON> Kostmayer </PERSON>'s committee was mainly interested in derailing his nomination. `` It looks that way,'' he said, noting that committees in both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> have already held extensive hearings on his role in the allegations involving Nine Mile Point.

 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> should drop its qualified support for teaching about condoms in public schools as a way of preventing AIDS, and should urge that youngsters be taught chastity instead, a committee of bishops said Thursday. `` There is no such thing as safe, or safer, sex. That's an illusion,'' said Archbishop <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahony </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, chairman of the Ad <ORGANIZATION> Hoc </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on the HIV Statement. HIV is the virus that causes AIDS. The committee's draft statement, which was criticized by an AIDS activist who said keeping information from children would be `` abandoning them to death,'' revises an earlier document released by the church's 50-member Administrative Board in December 1987. The 1987 document said the church could tolerate public schools' providing information about condoms as long as sexual abstinence outside of marriage was presented as the `` only morally correct and medically sure way'' to prevent AIDS After it was released, it was criticized by some conservative <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bishops who said it would be misinterpreted as condoning sex outside marriage and artificial birth control. Cardinal <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratzinger </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congregation </ORGANIZATION> for the Doctrine of the Faith, also chastised the administrative board for not consulting with the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. In spring 1988, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION> decided to draw up a new statement. The revised statement _ `` Called to Compassion: A Response to the HIV-AIDS Crisis'' _ will be presented to the conference at its fall meeting Nov. 6-9 in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. The committee drafting the statement was made up of <PERSON> Mahony </PERSON>, Cardinal <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernardin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, Cardinal <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Law </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, Archbishop <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keeler </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> Raymod </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lessard </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga </LOCATION>. The wide-ranging statement also opposes universal mandatory AIDS testing, calls for increasing federal funds for AIDS research, and denounces violence and discrimination against AIDS victims as immoral. `` We are called to be a people of compassion, after the teachings of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Mahony </PERSON> said. Where the new statement differs from the earlier document, titled `` The Many Faces of AIDS: A Gospel Response,'' is mainly in its stand on condom education in public schools, and in a larger sense the role of <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops in public policy debates. The first document approached condom education as the lesser of two evils in reducing the risk of AIDS in students who are unlikely to remain chaste. It said the bishops did not approve of condom use but were willing to join with others in a society of diverse religious beliefs in a dialogue on how sexuality `` might be communicated in our public schools and elsewhere.'' Bishop <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Covington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, chairman of the task force that drew up the original statement, said at the time: `` We're offering to work with members of other faiths and people of good will on moral values that we can make part of the presentation -LRB- on AIDS -RRB-.'' <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> was not available Thursday afternoon to respond to the new report, his office said. <PERSON> Mahony </PERSON> said many bishops believed that when the church indicated a willingness to compromise on Catholic teaching to become more influential in public policy, it was `` terribly confusing'' to Catholics. `` That's never been our role,'' <PERSON> Mahony </PERSON> said. `` Even to start down that road is fraught with difficulties.'' <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Blotcher </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> AIDS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unleash </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION>, criticized the proposal, saying `` to deny these children this information is abandoning them to death. I do n't see anything moral about that. If the church intends to save its kids, they're going about it entirely the wrong way. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON>, a professor of Christian ethics at <ORGANIZATION> Notre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dame </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said the new document `` may well be an attempt to achieve some kind of political peace within the -LRB- bishops' -RRB- conference.'' <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON> said telling students who refuse to be sexually inactive to use condoms to try to save lives is not an invitation to immoral behavior, any more than telling students not to drive drunk is an invitation to insobriety. But the bishops' revised document said condom education is a `` quick-fix'' solution to the AIDS crisis. `` The ` safe-sex' approach to preventing HIV-AIDS, though frequently advocated, compromises human sexuality and can lead to promiscuous sexual behavior,'' the bishops said. `` Not only is the use of prophylactics in an attempt to halt the spread of HIV technically unreliable; promoting this approach means, in effect, promoting behavior which is morally unacceptable.'' On similar grounds, the bishops said it was wrong to supply clean needles to drug addicts to prevent them from acquiring AIDS by sharing contaminated needles. The committee said that approach could encourage more drug abuse and discourage abusers from seeking treatment. But the bishops rejected the idea that AIDS is a direct punishment from God. `` Recall that unborn children can be infected in the womb and that people can acquire HIV from transfusions with contaminated blood. To suppose that HIV is God's punishment implies that God is vindictive and capricious,'' the bishops said. Within the church, the bishops called on dioceses to develop pastoral programs to care for people with AIDS and to be an advocate for ensuring their civil liberties, `` while also promulgating its own non-discrimination policies in employment, housing, delivery of medical and dental care, access to public accomodations, schools, nursing homes and emergency services.''

<HEAD>Conference Standoff Over Ivory Trade</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>'s chief delegate to a world conclave concerned with protecting <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s elephant population said Thursday, `` If they trample on your fields and on your crops, you do n't feel sentimental about them.'' The 103-nation meeting of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, or CITES, was deeply divided over how to tighten control of ivory sales worldwide. Statements from supporters and foes of a total ban suggested both sides were standing firm despite strong behind-the-scenes efforts to reach a compromise solution. Conference sources said a decision was not likely to come before the windup phase of the meeting, which ends Oct. 20. The conference is to act on proposals concerning more than 200 species but discussions focused on the proposal by seven states, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION>, amounting to a worldwide ban of trade in ivory. It formally calls for CITES to transfer the elephant from Appendix II of the convention, where limited trade of products is allowed, to Appendix I, which would prohibit all commerce in ivory tusks, skin or elephant meat. <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION> are opposed. They argue they have maintained their elephant populations by careful management and that sales of elephant products finance conservation efforts. <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> <PERSON> Chitepo </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>'s chief delegate, told a news conference Thursday that any worldwide ban would `` guarantee the extinction of the elephant'' because there would be no more economic interest in protecting them. She gave her country's elephant population as 52,000. Estimates of the global herd vary from 700,000 to 400,000, compared with a reported 1.3 million a decade ago, but <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> says its numbers are on the rise. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chief delegate <PERSON> Constance </PERSON> <PERSON> Harriman </PERSON> reaffirmed she will press for a sweeping prohibition. She criticized a proposal by CITES Secretary-General <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Lapointe </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> that the three southern African nations be allowed limited trade under Appendix II, termed `` split listing.'' `` I think he has exceeded his authority and showed poor judgment,'' she said of <PERSON> Lapointe </PERSON>. Private comments by several delegates indicated growing support for a similar compromise formula advanced by <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Holdgate </PERSON>, British director general of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nature </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Holdgate </PERSON> also favors split listing. In addition, he proposed that southern <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> countries benefiting from it commit themselves to a new tight control mechanism and accept a voluntary moratorium on the sale of ivory until that system is in place and promises to be effective. `` We have not fully discussed it yet but I think it is a reasonable approach,'' said delegate <PERSON> Pieter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulder </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, which estimates its elephant population at 9,300. Delegates from smaller African nations also voiced sympathy for <PERSON> Holdgate </PERSON>'s proposal Delegates clamoring for a total ban said they were confident they would get the two-thirds vote required to have the elephants listed under Appendix I. Some African countries with large elephant populations have kept a low profile so far, including <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>, with almost half of the estimated African total. Disclosure that CITES activities are partially financed by ivory traders have not created much of a stir at the <LOCATION> Lausanne </LOCATION> meeting. The issue has not been formally raised in the plenary meetings of about 800 delegates.

 The prosecution in the lengthy <ORGANIZATION> McMartin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pre-School </ORGANIZATION> molestation trial began his closing argument Thursday, telling jurors the school's young students were snared in a web of gradually escalating abuse. The chief defendant, <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON>, 31, appeared calm and relaxed when Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunson </PERSON> began his summation of the case, which at 2 -LCB- years is the nation's longest criminal trial. <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON> said in the courthouse hallway he felt `` OK'' and added: `` I'm relieved. It's now down to just weeks, and we're finally getting to a jury.'' <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON> and his mother, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> McMartin </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON>, 62, are charged with a total of 64 counts of molestation and a shared count of conspiracy involving 11 children at the family-owned <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> preschool. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Pounders </PERSON>, who has worried aloud about completing the trial because no alternate jurors are left, said each side would have 6 -LCB- days for arguments and he expects a lengthy deliberation. <PERSON> Gunson </PERSON> sought to explain how crimes were committed by people who have been portrayed in court as not being like molesters, and how they went unreported. `` Although parents would expect their child to tell them if they were abused, they do n't,'' <PERSON> Gunson </PERSON> said. Referring to expert testimony, <PERSON> Gunson </PERSON> said this was because it was not a case of a stranger molesting and injuring a child, but rather a gradual entrapment and web of secrecy growing up around the defendants' actions. The web tightened by means of gifts and games, and benefited from children's fears of being blamed and not being believed, according to the theory. Expert testimony also showed that molesters often feel genuine affection toward children who return that affection, the prosecutor said. `` We have Mr. <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON> saying he loved children,'' he said. <PERSON> Gunson </PERSON> told jurors they should not assume that some stories changed because children had talked with prosecutors and therapists from <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, a child-abuse detection and treatment center. The defense has argued that the children were, in effect, brainwashed. <PERSON> Gunson </PERSON> launched into a detailed summary of events, focusing first on a girl who testified she was molested and made to play a `` naked movie star'' game. The girl was 2 years, 8 months old when she entered the school in September 1977 and was 5 -LCB- years old when she left in 1980. She was 9 years old when she first talked to therapists at Children's <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> and was 12 by the time she testified at the trial More than 1,000 pieces of evidence have been entered, $ 15 million has been spent, 124 witnesses have testified and every one of the six alternate jurors has been used because of illness and employment problems. Court proceedings have produced 60,000 pages of record. The case began in 1983 as the largest child molestation prosecution ever. Authorities said hundreds of children were molested over five years. Seven teachers were arrested and charged with 207 counts. Prosecutors said children were molested during rituals with satanic overtones, then terrified into silence by teachers who mutilated animals and threatened to harm the pupils' parents. After an 18-month preliminary hearing, District Attorney <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Reiner </PERSON> dismissed charges against five defendants, saying there was too little evidence to try them. The hearing alone cost the government $ 6 million. The trial became the longest criminal trial in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history in April, surpassing the two-year record of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s Hillside Strangler case.

<HEAD>Democrats Urge Bush Not to Veto Abortion Legislation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Democratic leaders in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> pressed President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Thursday not to veto legislation that would end a ban on federally financed abortions for the `` most vulnerable <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women'' _ the poor who are victims of rape or incest. They acknowledged that supporters of the relaxed Medicaid abortion limits do not have enough votes to override <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s threatened veto but urged him to reconsider House Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> said he had not heard from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on the possible abortion veto, but told reporters, `` I've never known him to go back on his word. But <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, in a joint statement with <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, said, `` The president's position is wrong It is harsh _ terribly harsh _ on the poorest, most vulnerable <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women.'' `` Not only is this a reflection of the majority position of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>, Democrat and Republican, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, but the American people as well,'' said <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash. `` The president has the power to deny an opportunity for poor women to make a choice in their tragic circumstances,'' he said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> threatened in August to veto the bill. `` Our signal's out there and he believes in it strongly, but will review the bill when it gets here,'' White House Press Secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Thursday. In an outcome that surprised even the victors, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 216-206 on Wednesday to reverse a decade of restrictions on Medicaid abortions. The vote was in favor of permitting federal money to be used to terminate pregnancies for poor women who are victims of rape or incest and who report it promptly to authorities. The provision would extend current law permitting Medicaid abortions only in cases where a woman's life was endangered by pregnancy and she could not afford to pay for an abortion. It is part of a $ 156.7 billion measure to finance labor, health and education programs for fiscal 1990 that has already been approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> but remains subject to final agreement on unrelated issues. Although many abortion-rights lawmakers said they expected a veto, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been been dogged by controversy on the abortion issue for a decade, and some anti-abortion groups have questioned his commitment. As recently as Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> said in a policy statement sent to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that it would recommend the president reject legislation permitting those relaxed regulations on Medicaid abortion. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had supported the broader language as a presidential candidate in 1980, and although he altered them as vice president, he has made seemingly conflicting statements on the issue. In an appearance Oct. 7, 1987, at an <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> high school, while campaigning for president, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a student who questioned him that while he opposes abortion, `` I would make the exception ... rape, incest, and the life of the mother.'' The new provision is narrowly drawn, permitting abortion when the victims report the rape or incest `` promptly,'' and officials said the change might affect only a small number of cases. But it was widely viewed as a symbolic victory for supporters of abortion rights and came as pro-choice forces were benefiting from an apparently changed political climate on abortion since the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling in July. That ruling opened the way for increased state regulation of abortions and, according to pro-choice forces, politically energized those who oppose limits on the right to an abortion. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> suggested there might be room for a compromise if both sides could agree to a provision permitting Medicaid abortions when the rape or incest victim reported that act within 48 hours of its occurance. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote came on the same day abortion rights groups enjoyed another symbolic victory, this time in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. The state legislature, in a special session called by Republican Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, rejected all the governor's proposed abortion restrictions. `` Certainly <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and the vote yesterday in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are reflective of a new political movement,'' said <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelman </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abortion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. `` The climate is changing.'' The league, the political arm of the pro-choice movement, announced its plans for a nationwide effort to oppose anti-abortion political candidates around the country in 1990, in races ranging from the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to the statehouses. The group also unveiled television and newspaper advertising it is running in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> aimed at defeating the anti-abortion Republican, <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, and electing the Democratic nominee, <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, who supports continuing legal abortions.

 Most people realize the chances of getting AIDS from an infected doctor are remote, but nearly 45 percent believe physicians with the disease should not be allowed to practice medicine, according to a survey. More than half _ 55.7 percent _ said if they learned their doctor had AIDS, they'd change doctors, according to survey results published in Friday's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. There have been no documented cases in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of a patient contracting AIDS from his physician, a spokesman for the federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> said Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> said the survey results indicate Americans need to be better educated about AIDS, and it cautioned that doctors must be afforded the same civil liberties as other citizens. `` Education alone is not enough,'' said <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> board member Dr. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickey </PERSON>. `` While education is necessary, we must reaffirm the rights of physicians.'' The survey of 2,000 people was conducted by telephone during the summer of 1988. Half of the respondents, who were selected at random, lived in areas with a high number of AIDS cases while the other half were chosen from all areas of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The authors said there was no significant difference in the two groups' responses Two-thirds of those polled said they believe the chance of contracting AIDS from an infected doctor is unlikely or non-existent, while 11 percent said they consider the chance of infection very likely and 22 percent considered it somewhat likely. Eighty percent of the respondents said a physician with AIDS should be obligated to tell his patients and 32 percent felt they should be told if their doctors were even treating patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. `` There is a generalized fear of AIDS that's not just related to concern about getting infected,'' said <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Maguire </PERSON>, co-author of the article. `` I think it shows that AIDS education is not the solution to the whole problem,'' said <PERSON> Maguire </PERSON>, a research associate at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Dentistry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` That's why we need anti-discrimination legislation. Just having the knowledge is n't enough to counteract'' fears, <PERSON> Maguire </PERSON> said. In an editorial accompanying the study, <PERSON> Dickey </PERSON> said physicians have the right to confidentiality in matters that are not pertinent to their practice. `` There is no ethical obligation'' for a doctor to tell his patients he has AIDS, the editorial said. `` It is imperative that physicians be extended at least the simplest of civil liberties that are extended to all other citizens _ the right to privacy and the right to work so long as others are not at risk.'' The editorial reiterated the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION>'s ethical position that physicians who run even a minimal risk of infecting their patients must refrain from practicing. Doctors who carry the AIDS virus must consult with their own physicians to establish any limits necessary to ensure the disease is not passed on, the editorial said. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>, however, recommends that AIDS-infected surgeons with open lesions who run the risk of direct contact with patients refrain from work, said <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Fallis </PERSON>. `` That's the only case in which the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> recommends that any health-care worker refrain from practice.'' AIDS cripples the body's defenses against disease, leaving a person prey to life-threatening infections and certain cancers. The fatal, incurable disease is caused by a virus that is spread mainly through sexual intercourse, sharing of contaminated hypodermic needles and from infected mothers to their infants before or during birth.

 Housing and Urban Development Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> ran into opposition Thursday from members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to some of the measures he is recommending for cleaning up his scandal-ridden department. Both Republicans and Democrats on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> sharply criticized <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s proposal to target more of the politically popular Community Development Block Grant -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> CDBG </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- program to strict antipoverty efforts. `` That was not the original intent of that program _ a targeted war on poverty,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Chalmers </PERSON> <PERSON> Wylie </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, the ranking Republican on the banking panel, which has oversight responsibilities for <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>. `` To stifle the certain degree of flexibility that <ORGANIZATION> CDBG </ORGANIZATION> has with its intentions would be absolutely outrageous to me,'' echoed Rep. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakar </PERSON>, a Democrat from <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. `` I do n't want to see some guidelines changed to inhibit my city's opportunity to use that money.'' Under current regulations, only 60 percent of the $ 3 billion that <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> funnels annually to state and local governments through <ORGANIZATION> CDBG </ORGANIZATION> grants for downtown revitalization projects must directly benefit poor people. As part of a 58-point plan to address widescale fraud, mismanagement and influence-peddling at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> last week proposed raising poverty-related targets for <ORGANIZATION> CDBG </ORGANIZATION> grants and housing subsidy programs to 75 percent. `` To avoid both the appearance and reality of favoritism,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> also proposed eliminating as political `` slush funds'' the discretionary programs that allow <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> to ignore merit and competition requirements in awarding community development and housing grants. `` I want to kick politics out of those decisions,'' he said Thursday. `` There would be no decision at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> by <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, staff, assistants or anyone based on who you know, what political party you belong to, how many consultants you hire or how much you pay them.'' While generally praising the thrust of <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s proposed reform measures, members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as well as several mayors have fidgeted the last week over the prospect of removing politics entirely from the process. `` Since the loss of revenue sharing, many mayors have used this as revenue sharing,'' <PERSON> Wylie </PERSON> told <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>. `` The implication that if a congressman calls about a project in his district there's something wrong is most unfortunate.'' Citing a litany of well-publicized past abuses, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said the discretionary funds and community development grants had often gone toward financing golf courses, swimming pools, high-rise hotels and scores of other projects with little or no benefit to the poor. `` If I do n't have criteria, you're going to haul me before this committee and have my head for doing things that are not figthing poverty, building houses, taking care of the poor ...,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said. However, Ms. <PERSON> Oakar </PERSON> and other members of the panel expressed fears that past abuses will be cited as a reason to allow an erosion in many of the programs. `` I'm not responsible because somebody in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> got a swimming pool,'' she said. `` My city operates that program well. I get the impression what we're going to do now is have this fortress built up as an overreaction and as a substitute for programing.'' Just two weeks ago, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> rejected <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>'s application for a $ 6.9 million <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grant </ORGANIZATION> for a $ 48 million rock' n' roll museum. Ms. <PERSON> Oakar </PERSON> said then she still hoped to get the federal aid through one of the so-called `` discretionary'' accounts that <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> wants abolished. At Thursday's hearing, she repeatedly voice irritation. `` If I want housing for downtown <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> and I have some phoney baloney regulations put up as a smokescreen so that our area does not get housing, you better believe I'm going to fight you on that,'' she told <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>. `` Good, I'm a fighter,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> retorted. `` I want to be a successful <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> secretary. ... But I have to call them as I see them, and we do n't think a UDAG grant for a rock' n' roll museum was necessary. It did not fit the criteria.''

<TEXT>
 Physicists trying to mimic the birth of the universe inside an atom smasher said Thursday they found strong evidence that the building blocks of matter belong to only three families, a discovery that `` puts a lid on the complexity of nature.'' `` This brings us closer to really understanding the physical universe and how it's put together,'' said <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> Richter </PERSON>, a 1976 Nobel laureate in physics and director of the <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Linear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accelerator </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> 30 miles southeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Experiments on the 3-mile-long, $ 125 million <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Linear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Collider </ORGANIZATION> showed the odds are 25-to-1 that there are only three families or `` generations'' of fundamental particles that make up matter, physicist <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Riordan </PERSON> said by telephone from <LOCATION> Stanford </LOCATION>. `` It means that somehow the universe is comprehensible, that it's not a total mystery, that it can be grasped by the human mind,'' <PERSON> Riordan </PERSON> said. `` It puts a lid on the complexity of nature at its most fundamental level.'' Until now, atom smasher experiments indicated only that there were no more than five or six families of fundamental particles such as electrons and quarks, <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> said. The universe contains more matter than antimatter. If there were fewer than three families of basic particles, the universe would contain equal amounts of matter and antimatter, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Schramm </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> astrophysicist. Because matter and antimatter destroy or `` annihilate'' each other, existence of fewer than three families means `` we would n't be here,'' he said `` The whole universe would be filled with radiation and very little else.'' On the other hand, if the building blocks of matter belonged to more than three families, the universe would contain more helium gas than it does, <PERSON> Schramm </PERSON> said. Everyday matter is made of four particles belonging to the first family. They are up quarks, down quarks, electrons and electron neutrinos. Electrons and electron neutrinos are both classified as `` leptons.'' Protons and neutrons in the nucleus of an atom are made of the two types of quarks. Electrons orbit the nucleus. Electron neutrinos are produced by exploding stars. The second family of particles can be found today only in atom smashers and cosmic rays from space. The particles are the strange and charmed quarks, and two leptons named muons and muon neutrinos. Particles in the third family _ first discovered in the mid-1970s _ are the bottom quark, the yet-undetected top quark, the tau lepton and the tau neutrino. They can be created today only in atom smashers but, like the other families of particles, existed naturally in the first few seconds after the `` big bang'' that scientists believe created the universe roughly 15 billion years ago. If there were more than three families of particles, experiments in <LOCATION> Stanford </LOCATION>'s particle smasher should have produced evidence of more than the three known types of neutrinos and possibly evidence for other quarks and leptons, but no such evidence was found, <PERSON> Riordan </PERSON> said. The machine, shaped like a giant tennis racket, includes a 2-mile-long linear accelerator that speeds up electrons _ the particles that create television pictures _ and their antimatter counterparts, called positrons. In the 1-mile-long part of the machine that looks like the head of the tennis racket, the particles are smashed together, annihilating each other in a way that comes close to re-creating the incredible temperatures and pressures that existed during the big bang. The collisions produce Z particles, which are so heavy they existed naturally only for moments after the big bang. The Zs produced in <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION>'s machine then decay into lighter particles such as quarks and leptons, which are studied with an 1,800-ton detection device. The atom smasher has produced nearly 500 Z particles since it made its first one last April, without yielding signs that more than three families exist. Cosmologists _ scientists who study the universe _ predicted in 1977 there should be only three or four families of fundamental particles. That was based on the amount of helium gas produced by the big bang and observed in the universe, which contains about 74 percent hydrogen, 24 percent helium and only 2 percent other elements, <PERSON> Schramm </PERSON> said. `` The big bang in some sense was a big hydrogen bomb turning hydrogen to helium, and the amount of helium made in that big bang depends on the number of families,'' <PERSON> Schramm </PERSON> said. He said he was very pleased with <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION>'s findings because `` it's the first time an accelerator experiment has confirmed a theoretical prediction made from cosmology.''

 Sinhalese radicals and troops fought in southern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> and at least 18 people were killed, the government said Thursday. Meanwhile, President <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> convened a conference of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s political parties in the hopes of finding a negotiated means to end the ethnic violence that has wracked this island nation for six years. The killings were reported over the past 24 hours, during which the radicals burned at least 39 government buildings, the government said in a statement. It said the victims included nine civilians, two policemen and a soldier in the Sinhalese-dominated south. Six unidentified burned bodies also were found in the region, said the statement, which gave no further details. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ranjan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wijeratne </PERSON> told reporters that more Indian peacekeeping troops will leave <LOCATION> Ampara </LOCATION> district on Monday. <LOCATION> Ampara </LOCATION> is about 125 miles east of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has withdrawn about 3,300 soldiers this year and promised to pull out the remaining 39,000 troops by Dec. 31. `` Details of the exact numbers leaving can not be revealed. ... But the whole withdrawal process ... will keep to the Dec. 31 deadline,'' <PERSON> Wijeratne </PERSON> said. The government has worked out a plan to replace the withdrawing Indian soldiers with Sri Lankan troops, said <PERSON> Wijeratne </PERSON>, also the deputy defense minister. Sri Lankan soldiers have been confined to barracks in the northeast under terms of a 1987 accord that allowed Indian troops to police the region. The accord aimed to end the ethnic Tamil insurgency for a separate homeland by giving them limited autonomy. It also allowed Indian soldiers to be deployed in the northeast to supervise an arms surrender by Tamil guerrillas and to maintain law. The accord sparked a violent backlash by Sinhalese in the south that was led by the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, an anti-government Sinhalese guerrilla group. The government says more than 5,000 people have been killed in two years of fighting between the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and government forces. The front said the 1987 peace plan gave too many concessions to the minority Tamils, who make up 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people. It also said the presence of Indian troops compromised the country's independence. Asked about the continued violence in the south, <PERSON> Wijeratne </PERSON> said the `` backbone of the -LRB- front -RRB- has not been broken yet, but we will begin operations against them in a day or two.'' In yet another attempt to end the fighting, <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> hosted an inter-party conference Thursday that was attended by 90 delegates from 22 political parties. <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> said he would accept until the end of the month suggestions on how to end the violence. The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> had not accepted an invitation to participate in the conference, but delegates, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>'s latest offer was aimed at them. Tamil militias, including the largest <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION>, are attending the conference. At least 11,000 people, including 1,000 Indian soldiers, have died in the 6-year-old Tamil separatist war, which grew out of complaints of discrimination in jobs and education by the majority Sinhalese. Sinhalese who are mostly Buddhists make up 75 percent of the population and control the government and the military. Tamils are mostly Hindus.

 A masterpiece from <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON>'s `` blue period'' long thought to have disappeared is expected to become the world's most expensive painting when sold at auction on Nov. 30, an auctioneer said Thursday `` Les Noces de Pierrette'' -LRB- `` Pierrette's Wedding'' -RRB-, executed in 1904-05 in <LOCATION> Montmartre </LOCATION>, is expected to bring $ 46 million to $ 61 million, said auctioneer <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Binoche </PERSON>. `` It's going to shatter the world record not only for Picassos, but for all paintings,'' <PERSON> Binoche </PERSON> said. The record paid at an auction for a <ORGANIZATION> Picasso </ORGANIZATION> was $ 48.7 million for a 1901 self-portrait titled `` Yo Picasso,'' sold on May 9. <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON>'s `` Irises'' became the most expensive painting in the world when it sold two years ago for $ 53.9 million. <PERSON> Binoche </PERSON> said he was hopeful Culture Minister <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Lang </PERSON> would allow `` Les Noces'' to leave <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. The painting is considered part of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s national heritage and must receive an official authorization to leave the country. With its hauntingly beautiful pink and blue tones, the work straddles <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON>'s best-loved early periods. Six figures _ their pale pink faces illuminated by an eerie light _ sit around a table with the newlyweds. The bride wears a Spanish-style mantilla. Her husband sports a top hat. Though experts are familiar with dozens of sketches <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON> drew for `` Les Noces,'' the final work dropped from sight years ago. Many thought it was lost in a fire. It surfaced in 1988 as part of a Picasso show in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Binoche </PERSON> said the work was long the property of a Swedish family that does not want to be identified. `` The family considered the painting to be a private treasure, and now it's for sale, that's all,'' he said. The sale has been hailed as the major event of the auction season. <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> has said the family of <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> <PERSON> Payson </PERSON>, the sellers of <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON>'s `` Irises,'' hope to fetch a similar price on Nov. 15 for an early <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON> self-portrait titled `` Au Lapin Agile,'' named after a tavern frequented by the artist.

<HEAD>Tank Sale Will Not Damage Israel's Security, Official Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A pending $ 3 billion sale of tanks and other equipment to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> will have little effect on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s security because the <LOCATION> Saudis </LOCATION> have indicated the weapons will be deployed far from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s borders, an administration official said Thursday The Saudis have told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials that the threats to their security come mostly from the country's neighbors to the northeast _ <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> _ and from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION>, along <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s southern border The main items are 315 modern tanks, but two-thirds of the price tag reflects the cost of equipment and ammunition, including huge trucks to transport any tanks that break down. The deal is roughly equivalent to one year's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistance to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration on Wednesday informally notified <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of the intended sale, setting in motion a 50-day period in which <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> either kills the deal by majority votes in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> or lets it go through. Deliveries will begin in about 1993. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has registered disapproval of the proposed sale of the M1A2 tank as a matter of principal but thus far has not raised serious objections, the official said. The sale also faces little apparent opposition from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s supporters on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. The official, briefing reporters on the condition he not be identified by name, said he expects some of the tanks will likely be deployed at a military training school in northwest <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> not far from the Israeli border. This should not be a concern to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> because `` you need only to look at a topographical map of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> to realize that tanks have a very difficult time indeed getting from <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in combat situations,'' the official said. A pamphlet on the tank sale, published by the State and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Departments </ORGANIZATION>, said the M1A2 will give the <LOCATION> Saudis </LOCATION> improved mobility over severe terrain. The M1A2 would replace French-built tanks designed 30 years ago. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> will benefit from the sale because the M1A2 will enhance the deterrent value of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> forces that guard natural resources of `` critical strategic importance'' to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the West, the pamphlet said. It added that the tank will provide a $ 3 billion boost to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports, tens of thousands of man-years of employment for American workers and over $ 680 million in savings and revenues to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Soviet Grain Harvest Higher Than Expected</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s 1989 grain harvest is turning out larger than previously forecast, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. Production is now estimated at 205 million metric tons, up 5 million tons from the previous forecast. Officials said the upward revision was due mostly to preliminary yield results published by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The latest estimate includes 89 million tons of wheat, an increase of 2 million tons, and 103 million tons of coarse grains such as corn and sorghum, up 3 million tons. The balance is made up of pulses, rice, buckwheat and `` miscellaneous'' grains. Officials also said the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s estimate of Soviet grain imports have been reduced 2 million tons to 35 million tons for the trading year that runs through June 30, 1990. In a related report, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> announced an additional sale to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> of 100,000 tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn for delivery in 1989-90 under a long-term supply agreement. Orders announced the last two weeks now total 3.8 million tons of corn and 325,000 tons of soybean meal. In addition, 143,700 tons of soybeans that had been sold for delivery earlier were carried over into the seventh year of the agreement between the two countries, which began Oct. 1. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans.

 A Swiss woman was kidnapped in northern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> Sunday, two days after the abduction of two <ORGANIZATION> Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> workers, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. Ministry spokesman <PERSON> Clemens </PERSON> <PERSON> Birrer </PERSON> said the part-time flight attendant was kidnapped by armed civilians during a visit to the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>. The woman's name and age were withheld at the request of her parents, <PERSON> Birrer </PERSON> said. Her disappearance brings to 19 the number of Westerners missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, including eight Americans. Most are believed captives of Shiite Moslems loyal to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Birrer </PERSON> said the woman's parents asked authorities not to publicize the case, but he confirmed the kidnapping after being asked to comment on unattributed news reports. <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> requested help from <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> because Syrian troops control much of northern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, he added. Last Friday, two <ORGANIZATION> Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> workers, <PERSON> Elio </PERSON> <PERSON> Erriquez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Emmanual </PERSON> <PERSON> Christen </PERSON>, were abducted in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. There have been no demands and no claims of responsibility in the kidnappings so far, and <PERSON> Birrer </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> officials did not assume the woman's abduction was connected to the most recent kidnappings.

<HEAD>Pediatrician Discloses Sex Change, Desire to Change Back</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEDALIA, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A respected pediatrician is causing a stir with the disclosure of sex change surgery to become a woman 11 years ago, and her desire to change back to a man. `` I was born male and I was raised male and I feel like that's the way I'll feel most contented,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Janis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON>, one of <LOCATION> Sedalia </LOCATION>'s two practicing pediatricians <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON>, 38, has refused to talk to reporters after she disclosed in an interview published Tuesday in The Sedalia Democrat that she was a man until her 1978 sex change operation _ and wanted to be a man once again. The disclosures surprised <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON>'s patients, but many have rallied around her. Some residents of <LOCATION> Sedalia </LOCATION>, a town of 21,000 people in central <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, are making fun of the physician. `` Some people are saying some really crude things, making jokes behind her back,'' said <PERSON> Asha </PERSON> <PERSON> Lees </PERSON>, whose twin, 10-month-old sons are <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON>'s patients. `` I figure she's been through a lot of pain and I hope that <LOCATION> Sedalia </LOCATION> wo n't run her out of town, that they'll let her stay,'' Ms. <PERSON> Lees </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> apologized to the town and said she wanted to continue her practice in <LOCATION> Sedalia </LOCATION>. `` This topic has the potential to be a flare point. ... I'm sorry for that and for giving this town or any part of the community any unwanted notoriety,'' she said <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> has a 4-year-old adopted son, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, and said he might be confused about her changing sexuality. She is taking male hormones and said she would not undergo reconstructive surgery right away. `` I tell <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> I </PERSON> am his mommy and I will always be his mommy, but I'm also his daddy,'' <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> said. `` I am his mother, his parent _ whatever you call it _ -LRB- but -RRB- that emotional attachment will be the same.'' Ms. <PERSON> Lees </PERSON> said she sent <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> flowers, a balloon and a card with her prayers after learning of the baby doctor's background and plans. Ms. <PERSON> Lees </PERSON> said she wants <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> to continue to care for her twins. `` I think she is an excellent doctor,'' Ms. <PERSON> Lees </PERSON> said. `` -LRB- A sex change -RRB- does n't bother me at all. Her thoughts will be the same whether she's a male or a female.'' <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Cable </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Sedalia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PTA </ORGANIZATION>, said she also was not disturbed by <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON>'s disclosures. `` I've heard nothing but good things about her as a doctor, and I do n't think a sex change is going to make any difference,'' she said. Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stockwood </PERSON>, chief of staff at <LOCATION> Sedalia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Bothwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, where <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> occasionally tends patients, said her sexuality will not affect her status at the hospital as long as she continues to provide good medical care. <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> said she consulted a child psychologist on how to deal with questions, and any confusion of her son and young patients as she changes back to a man. `` I'm going to be direct and honest ... and answer their questions, and emphasize to them that I'm still the same and will still doctor them the same,'' she said. `` But, gradually, I will begin to look more like their daddy than their mommy.'' <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> was married before deciding at age 25 to become a woman. The marriage ended in divorce. A woman who answered the telephone Thursday at <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON>'s office and refused to give her name said said all calls from the media were being referred to <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> lawyer, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that blind candidates will be allowed to join the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and serve as diplomats abroad.

<TEXT>
 A high East German official rejected the democratic reforms some Soviet bloc allies have embraced and said Thursday that communism will continue to dominate society. Another said the government will listen to `` all parts of the population'' clamoring for change as long as they do not insist on scrapping the current social order. There were signs of strong differences within the leadership over how to deal with the flight of tens of thousands of citizens to the West and growing demand at home for a freer society. Reports persisted that 77-year-old <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, the nation's hard-line leader, was in trouble. <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION>, a mass-circulation West German newspaper, quoted <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> sources it did not identify as saying <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> would be replaced Oct. 18. <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lintner </PERSON>, inter-German affairs spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> in the West German parliament, was quoted in the daily <ORGANIZATION> Passauer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Neue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presse </ORGANIZATION> as saying <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>'s departure was `` immediately at hand.'' <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> sources in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> said an increasing number of ranking party figures are displeased with how <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> handled the exodus of young, skilled workers and recent pro-democracy protests. The official news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> carried a routine dispatch Thursday that omitted his title as head of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the more powerful of his two posts. ADN usually refers to him as both <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader and head of state. <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>'s picture has not appeared on the front pages of party newspapers for two days. It usually appears daily. <PERSON> Der </PERSON> <PERSON> Tagesspiegel </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> paper, said Thursday `` a strong majority'' in the ruling 21-member Politburo favored <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>'s departure After what sources said was a volatile meeting, the Politburo promised on Wednesday to examine the causes of the flight and the protests. It said the government would be willing to discuss reforms. <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> sources in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> said late Thursday that <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> officials were preparing to release all those arrested in protests there since Sept. 11. The number was not immediately known, but up to 500 people are believed still to be in jail. Whatever the hints of a more liberal attitude, a commentary in the <ORGANIZATION> Berliner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeitung </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Thursday by <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Reinhold </PERSON> emphasized `` the leading role of the party'' in bringing about any change. <PERSON> Reinhold </PERSON> said he wanted to distinguish the role of the party in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> from the `` ever-increasing variety'' of changes in other Socialist countries. The statement was obviously a reference to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s previously sharp repudiations of the dramatic democratic reforms sweeping <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc allies <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> `` Reforms for the sake of reforms are n't in demand, but rather changes which will serve the further development of socialism,'' <PERSON> Reinhold </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Hager </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> ideology chief and another influential Politburo member, offered a more conciliatory line. He was quoted by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> ZDF </ORGANIZATION> television as saying that there was no `` differences of opinion'' in the party leadership. He said leaders had agreed it was necessary to open a dialogue `` all parts of the population.'' But <PERSON> Hager </PERSON> strongly indicated that he did not include the growing opposition movement among them. `` If they want to question our social order, then that's not a basis for discussions,'' said <PERSON> Hager </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hager </PERSON>'s remarks came during a trip to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for the opening of a culture exhibition. Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, during a visit to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> last week, urged <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> to undertake reforms. Meanwhile, reaction was cautious Thursday to the statement the day before by the Politburo, which is trying to appease somewhat the forces of unrest while still presenting a unified front committed to socialism. <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Stolpe </PERSON>, a top <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> official in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, welcomed the government's commitment to dialogue as `` an important step.'' But <PERSON> Baerbel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bohley </PERSON>, co-founder of the opposition group New Forum, described the Politburo statement as a `` verbal shift that does not take into account real life.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> welcomed the East German offer of a dialogue but said `` dialogue should be meaningful and not just a tactical move to relieve domestic and international pressure.'' West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s chief of staff, <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Seiters </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> was optimistic. `` This could be the first positive signal to the populace that the East German leadership has given,'' <PERSON> Seiters </PERSON> said of the Politburo statement. `` But we must wait to see what concrete measures it carries.''

<HEAD>Army Chief of Staff: No Surprise Manpower Cuts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Army Chief of Staff Gen. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Vuono </PERSON> said Thursday that he would prefer to have long-term cuts in armed forces personnel worked out through the arms control process than have them `` dropped on us right now'' during budget negotiations on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Vuono </PERSON>, in a meeting with reporters, noted that <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> has already proposed a cut of 8,000 Army personnel in the 1990 fiscal year. Out of the more than 2.1 million people on active military duty, a cut of 16,800 positions was proposed by <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> in May. Some 8,000 were to come from the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, 5,600 from the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and 3,200 from the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, while the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> was untouched. But in current House-Senate negotiations on the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget, lawmakers have eyed cuts of up to 40,000 individuals to meet spending limits in the 1990 fiscal year. `` I would hope that we can see our way clear in'90 and'91 without taking any major end strength reductions and enable us to shape that -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- figure based on the president's proposal right now on the arms control table. That gives us a better opportunity to shape it, rather than piecemeal in'90 and piecemeal in'91,'' <PERSON> Vuono </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> chief of staff said that if an arms control proposal is signed in 1992 or beyond, `` we'll have to take some additional number out of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. We can plan for that. We are planning for that.'' <PERSON> Vuono </PERSON> said he did n't care for the idea of `` a cut dropped on us right now in addition'' to the cuts currently proposed on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>.

Israeli radio stations and most newspapers said the air force failed to scramble inteceptors before the plane landed near <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION>, a city of 250,000. `` There is a question that people justly ask: how and why it happened that a plane came in without being detected immediately,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told high school students in <LOCATION> Raanana </LOCATION>. `` There is an investigation regarding this. ... I think that people of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, with their experience of many years, can certainly trust and give full confidence to its air force. `` Let's not turn an event that should be joyful into a cause for arguments and worries. It's good for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> that such an important, significant, valuable plane ... abandoned <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and came to us.'' Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON> appointed a team to investigate, the army command said in a communique. It will look into control, anti-aircraft and command operations and report by Monday. Whether the investigators had power to recommend action against individuals who may have failed in their duties was not clear. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s eight leading dailies asked on their front pages how the pilot, Maj. <PERSON> Adel </PERSON> <PERSON> Basem </PERSON>, 34, managed to land without interference on a crop-dusters' airstrip at <LOCATION> Megiddo </LOCATION>, 57 miles north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, and spend 20 minutes on the ground before security officials arrived. <ORGANIZATION> Davar </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said the plane crossed the <LOCATION> Golan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION> at an altitude of 100 feet at about 780 mph. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s implacable foe. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> annexed the <LOCATION> Golan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION> after capturing them from <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. <PERSON> Yaakov </PERSON> <PERSON> Abudi </PERSON>, an airfield official who was the first to meet <PERSON> Basem </PERSON>, quoted the pilot as saying one major reason he defected was being beaten after asking for better housing. A Syrian official in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> said the pilot did not defect but had to make an emergency landing. Israeli officials denied the plane had technical problems. An Israeli army spokesman said a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> request to meet <PERSON> Basem </PERSON> would be examined but added the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> `` routinely visits detainees in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and he is not a detainee.'' Officials refused to say where or under what conditions <PERSON> Basem </PERSON> was staying.

<HEAD>Nursing Home Reopens Week after Fatal Fire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORFOLK, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A nursing home ravaged by a fire last week that killed 12 residents reopened Thursday after passing state and local inspections. State Health Commissioner Dr. C.M.G. Buttery said the <ORGANIZATION> Hillhaven </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitation </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Convalescent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> was authorized to let residents back on the third and fourth floors. The second floor, where the fire started, is being renovated and was not approved for patient care. The first floor houses services such as the dining room and therapy rooms. <PERSON> Lori </PERSON> <PERSON> Peacock </PERSON>, regional marketing director for <ORGANIZATION> Hillhaven </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said the first resident returned Thursday afternoon. `` We've only heard about a half a dozen residents who are not planning to return,'' she said. The city fire marshal said earlier this week that a blown fuse prevented an alarm from being relayed to authorities when the blaze broke out shortly after 10 p.m. on Oct. 5. The alarm system also releases magnets holding fire doors open. Had the system functioned properly and closed the doors, smoke would not have filled part of the second floor, where most of the deaths occurred, officials said. Fire inspectors cited the nursing home for failing to ensure the alarm system worked, and for failing to notify the fire department when the alarms were shut down for three days in September to fumigate the building. Assistant City Fire Marshal <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beisch </PERSON> said Thursday that the nursing home had repaired the alarm system and that fire officials were satisfied that the home complied with the city fire code. The city building inspector also gave the home permission to resume operations. Authorities said the fire started when a patient who was smoking, in violation of regulations, accidentally tossed a lighted match onto a bed. The fire was contained to one room on the second floor, but smoke poured through the building. Nine people were killed in the fire and three other residents died Monday and Tuesday in hospitals. Those three were among 98 injured in the fire. The home had 161 residents. In another development, a resident of the nursing home filed a $ 3 million lawsuit against the home's owner Wednesday in <ORGANIZATION> Norfolk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Edna </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, 88, who is in stable condition at a hospital, alleges that her injuries resulted from negligence and breach of duty by the nursing home. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Hillhaven </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s director of operations, declined to comment on the lawsuit.

<HEAD>Walesa: Can Solidarity Save Poland Again?</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said Thursday that Solidarity saved <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> from civil war, but he wonders whether the independent trade union movement can now lead the country out of economic chaos. The Solidarity leader predicted the worst of the process of rescuing the economy, which is beset by inflation, product shortages and low industrial productivity, could be over in a year, but he said the government will have to do a better job of explaining its policies to a restless populace. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> also said that if the first non-communist government in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc, led by Solidarity journalist <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> as prime minister, fails, `` We will have the moral right to accuse the world of not helping us.'' The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is supporting a $ 119 million, three-year package of economic aid and $ 100 million in food aid to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Congressional critics are calling for more. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> made the comments at his weekly news conference at Solidarity headquarters in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, a forum he has used to make a series of dramatically worded commentaries on worsening conditions in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. `` I claim that it was Solidarity that saved this country from a civil war. Is it capable of saving it now? That's a question I'm asking myself,'' he said `` I'd like to emphasize that we avoided civil war and there is a chance for rescue in the nearest future. If society understands this maneuver and joins in, it will all take not more than a year.'' Solidarity, banned after martial law was declared in December 1981, was re-legalized this year after a wave of strikes in August 1988 brought a series of talks and sweeping reforms in April. The Solidarity-led government came to power in August after free elections in June. The new government proposes a rapid shift to a market-oriented economy but acknowledges the situation _ inflation is 600 percent annually _ will likely worsen before it gets better. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said the new government is not explaining its changing policies well enough. `` When I do n't understand something, it means that at least 60 percent of the society does n't understand it,'' the union leader said. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> also said local government elections, expected to challenge the last bastion of communist control, should not be held too soon. `` It will only divide the nation, which will concentrate on electoral struggle and not on the reforms that must unite us,'' he said.

<HEAD>Human Rights Official Estimates 77 Dead After Failed Coup</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Panamanian human rights official said Thursday that 77 people were killed and 200 arrested following last week's coup attempt against Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Escoffery </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Panamanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the casualty figure was based on sketchy evidence but challenged the <ORGANIZATION> Panamanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> to disprove it. `` If it's not true, we will say it publicly,'' <PERSON> Escoffery </PERSON> said. `` But until the government cooperates with us, we presume our information to be true.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Troncoso </PERSON>, the rights committee's vice president, said he believed the information the committee has is too sketchy to give any estimates. The day after the Oct. 3 coup attempt, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> issued a communique that said 10 rebels were killed and 37 detained in the uprising. <PERSON> Troncoso </PERSON> and <PERSON> Escoffery </PERSON> said the rights group had received dozens of telephone calls, most of them anonymous, from people who said a relative, friend or neighbor in the military had not been seen since the uprising. `` We presume there are many more than this,'' <PERSON> Troncoso </PERSON> said. But he said repeatedly that the evidence was too sketchy to be precise. The committee wrote to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and therefore leader of the country, three days after the failed coup asking permission to visit imprisoned mutineers. `` We are still awaiting a reply,'' <PERSON> Troncoso </PERSON> said.

 Reports Thursday from the Soviet Caucasus region said <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s railroad woes were easing but political tension rose anew in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. The Azerbaijani rail blockade that left <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> critically short of basic supplies and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> hurting for fuel was all over, the <LOCATION> Azerbaijani </LOCATION> news agency <PERSON> Azerinform </PERSON> said Thursday. `` Freight traffic from <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> has been fully restored,'' it said, but admitted fewer trains than expected arrived in the two republics. The unrelenting conflict in the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION>, a jigsaw puzzle of nationalities set among the mountains between the Black and the Caspian seas, is proving one of the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s most intractable ethnic problems. In the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> region, two men were killed this week in clashes with authorities, the Soviet newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Komsomolskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. In <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, activists said a mass meeting in the capital, <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>, drew thousands Wednesday night to support calls for Georgian independence and against the Soviet draft. `` Fifty people have declared a sit-in near the Sports Palace against the occupying army,'' <PERSON> Tea </PERSON> <PERSON> Daraselyan </PERSON>, a member of a Georgian independence group, said Thursday in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>. She said the meeting Wednesday asked Georgian youths to refuse to serve in the Soviet army and asked all Georgians to boycott upcoming elections. Nationalist fervor has run high in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> since spring, when 19 Georgians died in a clash between pro-independence protesters and Soviet troops. Ethnic unrest also turned bloody in the Georgian enclave of <LOCATION> Abkhazia </LOCATION> this summer. <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> has been the source of a vicious territorial dispute between <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> for 18 months. The ethnic Armenian majority wants the region taken from <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> and annexed to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. Kremlin officials imposed direct rule there trying to calm tensions. <ORGANIZATION> Komsomolskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Akonyan </PERSON> of the region's main city <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION> was killed late Tuesday in a clash between soldiers and local residents. It said R.E. <PERSON> Sadikov </PERSON>, another resident of the area, was killed Monday. It quoted military officials as saying they arrested <PERSON> Sadikov </PERSON> and took a rifle from him, but he then attacked a soldier and was killed trying to escape. In both cases, soldiers were injured, said the report. <PERSON> Akonyan </PERSON> apparently was killed in a clash reported Wednesday by <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Arshenevsky </PERSON>. Independent Armenian reports identified the victim as 38-year-old <PERSON> Spartak </PERSON> <PERSON> Hacobian </PERSON>. <PERSON> Arshenevsky </PERSON> said a crowd attacked a convoy of firefighters with stones and firearms, and they were forced to defend themselves. He reported eight people hurt, two critically. Rail shipments through <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> were cut off late this summer. The blockade also affected <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Azerbaijan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> political movement, which organized a general strike that included the rail tieup, decided this week to end the blockade. <ORGANIZATION> Komsomolskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> said freight began arriving in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, but not food or fuel shipments, the two most needed items. In <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, the blockade halted much reconstruction work in areas devastated by December's earthquake, which left 25,000 dead.

 <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said Thursday that he's encouraged by advances in the `` Brilliant Pebbles'' component of Star Wars, but that he would recommend President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> veto the Pentagon budget bill unless <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> improves funding for the program. <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION>, locked in negotiations with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in an attempt to stave off cuts in the program's billion-dollar budget, acknowledged he's got a tough battle ahead. `` We've got to convince people that it's necessary,'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said of the Strategic Defense Initiative in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. House and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> conferees hammering out the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s budget for the 1990 fiscal year that began Oct. 1 are at loggerheads over the program. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved $ 4.5 billion for <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION> in its authorization bill last month, while the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> adopted a funding level of $ 3.1 billion. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had requested $ 4.9 billion. If the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> recommendation prevails, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said he would be forced to eliminate some technology options, cancel contracts and scale back research. `` Should the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> produce legislation with inadequate funding levels for SDI, I will recommend to the president that he veto the bill,'' he said. <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION>, holding up a camera that would be used in the Brilliant Pebbles program, lauded scientists for developing a `` lighter, smaller and cheaper'' system he said would save `` enormous sums of money.'' `` I'm very encouraged,'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said. `` We are using mostly off-the-shelf technology. No scientific breakthroughs have been necessary to create Brilliant Pebbles. We are basically using what we have. `` We have n't yet settled on a final design ... but the work is going well, and, most important, we see no major scientific roadblocks to the program.'' Brilliant Pebbles refers to the swarm of thousands of small computerized rockets that would be put in space to locate, track and smash enemy missiles by bumping into them rather than through explosive force. It is only one possible component of Star Wars, which has gained greater opposition as budget cuts soak up scarce defense funds. Some critics contend Star Wars experiments could derail U.S.-Soviet advances in arms control. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> spoke positively about other aspects of Star Wars, including research in laser-beam technology and ground-based interceptor systems. He repeated assertions that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s strategic defenses have improved, not weakened, under <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorabachev </PERSON>

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> began plowing through a $ 14.1 billion deficit-reduction bill Thursday as <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> claimed enough votes to block Republicans from tacking on a cut in the capital-gains tax. Unless <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> completes action before Monday on the eight-inch-thick bill _ which is almost impossible _ automatic, across-the-board reductions will be triggered in most federal spending programs. But <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has left itself an out: Even if the automatic cuts take effect, they can be restored as soon as the bill is enacted. The sheer size of the bill and the fact that it was put into final form barely two hours before debate began were enough to cause some senators to view the automatic spending cuts as the lesser of two evils. `` If somebody wanted to manufacture a piece of legislation absolutely confirming the worst suspicions they have about the budget process, it would be this piece of legislation,'' said Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, R-Colo. `` It is impossible as a practical matter for any senator to have more than a general idea of what's in this bill. He lodged his complaint as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, voting 9-7, approved the bill, which was written by eight other committees. Members of both parties expressed concern because the bill is laden with amendments that have nothing to do with reducing the deficit. During the first four hours of debate on the bill, Republicans criticized <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for not being conscientious in cutting the deficit; <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> lambasted President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for pushing the capital-gains cut, and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved its first amendment of the day _ spending an extra $ 40 million for hospitals. Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>, D-Tenn., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, acknowledged the bill `` does not boldly address a deficit problem that appears to have drifted from under the spotlight of public scrutiny. But it does restrain the deficit and it meets guidelines the administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> agreed on last spring, he said. <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, senior Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, promised an effort on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor to strip away some of the extraneous provisions. Although the major purpose of the spending bill is to reduce the deficit in the current budget year to about $ 110 billion, most of its bulk is attributable to hundreds of pet projects. These range from a child-care initiative to repeal of a law designed to prevent discrimination in employer-paid health care to scores of tax breaks for various special interests. More important to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> senators, the bill does not contain the capital-gains tax cut that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> promised during the campaign last year. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> rejected the cut in favor of a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> plan to liberalize tax-deductible Individual Retirement Accounts. Republicans and a handful of Democrats have been considering trying to add a capital-gains cut to the bill, but there was no certainty they would make the effort. The reason is that while a majority of senators favor some kind of capital-gains reduction, backers apparently can not muster the 60 votes required under <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rules to attach the reduction to the deficit bill. `` Without a doubt'' Democrats can block the capital-gains cut, Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, told reporters. However, a capital-gains cut is likely to end up in the deficit-reduction bill when negotiators from the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> produce the final version of the legislation. That is because the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill contains a reduction that was approved by a lopsided majority of representatives. About $ 5.3 billion of the $ 14.1 billion worth of deficit reduction in the bill would come from a package of mostly minor tax increases. The one with the most impact on the most people would make permanent the 3 percent tax on local and long-distance telephone service, due to expire at the end of 1990. A freeze in increased Medicare reimbursements for doctors, a reduction in payments to hospitals and other Medicare changes would produce an additional $ 3 billion. Removing the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> _ and its own deficit _ from the budget would `` save'' $ 1.77 billion. Extending the authority of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> to charge a 1 percent fee on guaranteed housing loans would bring in $ 169 million. The string of special-interest tax breaks in the bill stretches from owners of tuxedo-rental stores to farmers with annual receipts under $ 5 million to small taverns to rich grandparents who give their grandchildren up to $ 2 million.

She said the company has had no more than four complaints annually since the company adopted the code. <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Babington </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON>, declined comment, saying company officials had not received the report. Efforts to reach Mead-Johnson were unsuccessful. The WHO code sets gives national governments primary responsibility for distribution of nutritional information and prohibits government or manufacturers' use of pictures of infants or written materials idealizing or promoting use of infant formula. The code also stipulates that product labels must include instructions on proper preparation and use of the formula and must emphasize the nutritional superiority of breast feeding. In addition, retail outlets can not use distributors' displays, advertisements or employees. Nor can doctors or health facilities distribute manufacturers' samples or formula information. In practice, <PERSON> Shingler </PERSON> said, `` The study, which involved 2,108 interviews in hospitals, clinics, retail outlets, foreign government agencies and with individual physicians, revealed problems of compliance in all the countries studied.'' The three-year study concludes that: _ More than half of the mothers interviewed had received no nutritional information about themselves and their children from government health agencies _ Information provided by both governments and formula makers did n't let people know the financial implications of using formula or the difficulty in reversing a decision to bottle feed _ Manufacturers, retailers, doctors, health-care facilities and governments violated prohibitions or restrictions in their promotion, advertising and marketing procedures _ Fewer than a third of the labels on formula cans included an expiration date However, `` where the governmental agencies responsible for health care made a firm effort to comply with the code, the manufacturers improved their level of compliance,'' said <PERSON> Shingler </PERSON>. `` The companies will do as much as they are required,'' said <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, task force researcher at a news conference Thursday. But <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said governments defend lax enforcement because `` their argument is that they do not have enough people and that the government needs money also.'' The countries included in the study were: <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Papua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s prosecutor-general asked the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on Thursday for a murder investigation into the 1940 killings of 15,000 Polish army officers at <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> and other Soviet sites. Prosecutor-General <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Zyta </PERSON> also asked Soviet authorities to clear the names of 16 military and political leaders of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s World War II anti-Nazi resistance convicted as `` bandits'' at a 1945 show trial in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> The Soviets were asked to `` carry out an investigation of murder at <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION>, and other places still unknown, of Polish officers interned in the fall of 1939 in camps at <LOCATION> Kozielsk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Starobielsk </LOCATION> and Ostaszkow,'' said a communique carried by the state <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency. The killings, one of the most painful issues in <LOCATION> Polish-Soviet </LOCATION> relations, had long been blamed by the Polish and Soviet governments on Nazi German troops. But most Poles and Western historians concluded the Polish officers interned in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> were executed on orders of Soviet dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> in 1940 before war broke out between the Soviets and <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. More than 4,200 bodies of Polish officers were found at <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Minsk </LOCATION>, in 1943. The bodies of an additional 11,000 officers have never been found. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> began rewriting the official account of the deaths in 1987 when they agreed to form a joint commission to review `` blank spots'' in history. <PERSON> Zyta </PERSON>'s communique noted that the Polish historians on the commission concluded more than a year ago that security officers of the Soviet <ORGANIZATION> NKVD </ORGANIZATION>, predecessor of today's <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>, carried out the killings. The Soviet historians never issued a concurring report and complained of being denied key archival material in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Lack of Soviet action raised calls in the Polish press for a formal legal investiation. `` In light of international commitments binding both on <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> crime has the feature of a homicide and is not subject to expiration,'' <PERSON> Zyta </PERSON>'s communique said _ meaning those responsible might still face trial. Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and Polish Communist First Secretary <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> reportedly discussed an investigation in talks Wednesday. `` Soviet comrades have taken up many problems which are more difficult and more painful to them than this one,'' <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> said later, according to Polish media reports. `` I am sure they are going to find an answer to this, our tragedy, too.''

 The Irish Republic will not prosecute an Irish former priest accused by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> of plotting <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> violence, a government legal officer said Thursday. <PERSON> Eamonn </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, director of public prosecutions, said material submitted by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to bring <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> to trial, as well as <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> police inquiries, were `` not sufficient to justify a prosecution.'' <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, 59, still wears clerical garb although the Roman Catholic leader in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Cardinal </PERSON> <PERSON> Basil </PERSON> <PERSON> Hume </PERSON>, archbishop of <LOCATION> Westminster </LOCATION>, has said he is no longer a priest. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> last year failed to secure <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>'s extradition on charges of murder and bombing conspiracy and explosives possession on the British mainland between 1975 and 1988. Irish Attorney General <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> said press coverage in the case was prejudicial to a fair trial. <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> indicated <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> might be tried in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> on the explosives charges but <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> decided against it. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>' decision was described as a `` most disappointing outcome'' in a statement by <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> director of public prosecutions. Delegates to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s governing <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> annual conference in <LOCATION> Blackpool </LOCATION> said the decision would strain Anglo-Irish relations. <PERSON> Ivor </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanbrook </PERSON>, a lawyer and <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> legislator, said, `` Clearly, there was enough evidence to prosecute <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>. The decision was made on political grounds.'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Brook </PERSON>, the government's <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> secretary, commented: `` I think we necessarily have to consider it as a disappointing decision but it is a decision the Irish government took on the papers before them.''

 A private school official says other academies are refusing to play scheduled football games against his team because he recently added a black player. `` They have n't actually said that. I do n't know that that's the reason they're not playing, but all indications point that way,'' <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Wooten </PERSON>, headmaster and head football coach at <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, a 15-year-old black student, transferred to <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> from nearby <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> <LOCATION> High </LOCATION> <LOCATION> School </LOCATION> four weeks ago. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinkerton </PERSON>, headmaster at <ORGANIZATION> Sharkey-Issaquena </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday his school would forfeit Friday night's game against <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> because his <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> Class A team was plagued with injuries and needed time for players to heal. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> said Wednesday that <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holmes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>, where is headmaster, would likely forfeit an Oct. 20 game at <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION>, but added: `` If we do n't -LRB- play -RRB-, it wo n't be because of that black.'' <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> refused to elaborate and neither he nor <PERSON> Pinkerton </PERSON> returned telephone calls Thursday from The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Wooten </PERSON> said <PERSON> Sharkey-Issaquena </PERSON> officials had told him they wanted their players fit for the remainder of the school's games against Class 1A schools in the MPSA. The association divides schools into classes of 1A, 2A and 3A with 3A being the largest schools. Heritage, with 540 students, is a 2A school. <PERSON> Wooten </PERSON> said <PERSON> Sharkey-Issaquena </PERSON> `` has as many people on the roster as we do. `` East <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> is in our conference and they really have n't given me any particular reason. We only have a 2-5 record, so it's not like we're awesome and beating everybody to death because we're not. <PERSON> Wooten </PERSON> said his athletes were disappointed. `` Other than that they're taking it very well. They know what the problem is,'' he said. <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said he was `` just a kid who likes to play sports. I'm not trying to change the world. The sophomore is the first black football player in the <ORGANIZATION> MPSA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>. He said he was n't bothered by the attitudes of the other schools. `` You ca n't be upset with them. It's like their religion.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> said Thursday its refusal to let <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> return illegal <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> immigrants is <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s fault, and refused to say when it would start accepting them again. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> suspended the repatriations Sunday, apparently in retaliation for <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s decision to let <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Yang </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> swimmer who sought asylum after participating in pro-democracy demonstrations in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, to leave for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Cooperation on returning mainland Chinese who flee to the British colony `` was damaged by the <LOCATION> British-Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> government unilaterally,'' <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhaoxing </PERSON> said at a weekly briefing. `` We hope <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> British-Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> government will express their sincerity in cooperation so that the agreements'' on border issues can be implemented, he said. Asked by a <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> reporter about reports that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> may stop supplying water and non-staple food to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> `` has always been very concerned about the compatriots in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Macao </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>Up To 50,000 Gallons Of Fuel Spilled At U.S. Antarctic Air Field</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Up to 50,000 gallons of gasoline and other fuels leaked from tanks at a depot near an American research station on the South Polar ice this week, officials said Thursday. Technicians are working in minus 40-degree temperatures are attempting to clean up the mess. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Renirie </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> which directs the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> research, said Thursday that experts have not ruled out sabotage as a cause. He said the leaks occurred `` in as many as seven'' of 10 rubberized bladders used to store jet fuel, diesel fuel and gasoline at <LOCATION> Williams </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION>, an aircraft landing strip five miles from <LOCATION> McMurdo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION>, the principle <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> research and supply station in the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION>. `` We've used these tanks at several locations in the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> and we've never had leaks from seven tanks simultaneously,'' said <PERSON> Renirie </PERSON>. `` Nobody has used the word sabotage,'' he said. `` Not yet.'' The summer reasearch season is just beginning at <LOCATION> McMurdo </LOCATION>, and about 400 people are now working there. At the peak of the season, about 800 scientists, engineers, technicians and workers will live at the station for the warmer months of the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> year. <PERSON> Renirie </PERSON> said the leaky tanks are in a storage area that is surrounded with protective dikes made of ice. He said the fuel is thought to have leaked and then filtered down through snow to an ice layer about 30 feet below the surface, forming a subsurface pool of about 180 feet long by 60 feet wide. The estimate of the amount of fuel leaked comes from records that indicate a shortage of about 50,000 gallons, he said. <LOCATION> McMurdo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Williams </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION> are located on the <ORGANIZATION> Ross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shelf </ORGANIZATION>, a deposit of ice several thousand feet thick that forms a large part of the apparent surface of the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> continent. <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Field </ORGANIZATION> is used as a major supply depot for all of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> operations in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Polar </LOCATION> area, including stations at the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pole </LOCATION> and at <LOCATION> Palmer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Ross </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. The ice where <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> is located is considered stable and <PERSON> Renirie </PERSON> said it will not move to the sea for years. As a consequence, he said, there is little danger that the spilled fuel will end up in the ecologically fragile ocean waters around the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION>. `` We expect that the environmental impact will be minimal when we get it out of there and tanked up,'' he said. `` It -LRB- spilled fuel -RRB- could be confined to the area just under the tanks for some time.'' <PERSON> Renirie </PERSON> said workers are attempting to dig snow away from the tanks to find and repair the leaks. They then will start the cleanup. `` They will pump out the fuel and slush and put it on a tanker sled and take it back to <PERSON> McMurdo </PERSON> for disposal,'' he said. The tanker sled holds about 3,000 gallons, he said, which means a number of trips will be required. The clean up workers must contend with temperatures dipping regularly to a minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit, the spokesman said. No method has yet been chose for disposal of the fuel, said <PERSON> Renirie </PERSON>. The fuel spill is the second in recent weeks at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> installations at <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>. Earlier, personnel at the Amundsen-Scott Station at the South Pole found that several thousand gallons of diesel fuel had leaked from a pipe that carried the fuel to a generator. Officials said then that the fuel drained down though the porous snow covering the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pole </LOCATION> and pooled deep under the surface. No attempt was made to clean up that spill. On Jan. 28, an Argentine ship called the <ORGANIZATION> Bahia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paraiso </ORGANIZATION> ran aground near <LOCATION> Palmer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> and spilled about 200,000 gallons of fuel and lubricants into the ocean. About 64,000 gallons remain aboard the <LOCATION> Bahia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paraiso </LOCATION>. The ship was abandoned and remains aground, leaking small amounts of fuel.

 Technicians worked six at a time in a cramped engine compartment Thursday to remove a flawed computer in time to meet a Tuesday target for launching the shuttle Atlantis and its <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> space probe. The workers had to stand on platforms to unhook the computer so it can be replaced Friday with a spare that will be tested for about 16 hours. `` The odds are still 50-50 that we'll be able to make a Tuesday launch,'' said <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Kristofferson </PERSON>. Space agency officials said they would decide Saturday whether to delay liftoff until Wednesday. Liftoff on Tuesday is scheduled for 12:57 p.m., the start of a 24-minute period in which the planet Jupiter will be in the proper position to nearly cross paths with the <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> spacecraft in 1995. Wednesday has a 27-minute launch window, and Nov. 21 is the last day <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION> will be in the proper position until mid-1991. After launch, Atlantis' crew of five astronauts is to release the 6,700-pound probe for the six-year journey to <LOCATION> Jupiter </LOCATION>. The launch originally was scheduled for Thursday, but <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> postponed the flight Tuesday after the engine computer, called a master controller, gave a false fuel pump pressure reading. Similar computers are located in the shuttle's other two main engines. They each weigh 230 pounds, cost $ 6 million and control all functions of their individual powerplant during the climb into orbit. Had <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> tried to launch Atlantis Thursday as originally planned, the effort would have been halted by bad weather, officials said. Clouds and high winds prevailed throughout the day, with intermittant rain. The astronauts were at their main training base in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> on Thursday, rehearsing in a shuttle simulator. A federal judge rejected a request by environmental groups to halt the flight for fear the nuclear-powered probe could scatter plutonium over <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> if the shuttle exploded. The groups filed a notice with the judge Thursday that they were going to appeal his ruling to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. The West German <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which focuses on environmental issues, is asking to join in legal actions to delay the launch. It hopes to gain time to get the issue of the space shuttle's nuclear cargo before the world court. `` Because of the shortness of time, they asked that we represent them,'' said <PERSON> Lanny </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinkin </PERSON>, a lawyer for the <ORGANIZATION> Christic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, one of three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> environmental groups that tried to stop the launch.

 Lebanese legislators reached tentative agreement on a peace plan Thursday, but the Christian army commander said their actions were irrelevant and he would renew his `` war of liberation'' against Syrian troops. `` We can not rebuild our country under the shadow of an occupying force,'' Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> told a meeting of bank employees in <LOCATION> Christian </LOCATION> east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, referring to the 40,000 Syrian soldiers stationed in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. He spoke hours after a committee of 17 Lebanese parliament members meeting in <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, approved a tentative plan for ending the 14-year-old sectarian civil war, which has cost more than 150,000 lives. Conference sources said the committee met again in the evening to prepare for a full session of the 63 deputies, who must approve the agreement. The evening session ended abruptly when <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> deputy <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Saadeh </PERSON>, leader of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Phalange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, objected to `` crippling'' demands and stormed out. He did not elaborate, and no word emerged on when committee meetings would resume. Committee members would not give provisions of the plan. <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> radio stations well connected with various factions said it provided for `` limited and phased'' Syrian withdrawal and curtailed the powers of the president, traditionally a Christian. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>: `` We want radical reforms of this system from the roots, and not the patching up of a rotten system the way they are trying to patch it up.'' He did not specifically mention the Taif agreement. `` Either there is reform in a free land where a free people lives, or there is n't,'' <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said. `` I hope everyone will be aware of this reality and always remember that a war of liberation erupted in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> for this purpose. `` It will continue until it achieves its goals. A meeting trying to abort the goals of this war will not stop it. Let those deputies understand that <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s sovereignty and independence are not a matter for bargaining and negotiation.'' <PERSON> Zaher </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Khatib </PERSON>, a Sunni Moslem deputy from the pro-Syrian <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> alliance </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> `` is the number one enemy of the nation ... trying to affect the course of the conference and abort its mission of salvaging the country and ending the suffering of its people.'' Syrian troops are in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under an <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping mandate issued in 1976, the year after fighting began. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> considers them an occupying force. He vowed to drive them out after an artillery war began March 8 between his <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> army units and a Moslem alliance led by the Syrians. At least 930 people were killed and more than 2,000 wounded, nearly all of them civilians, before a cease-fire sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> stopped the shelling Sept. 22. On Sept. 30, those of the 99 Lebanese parliament members who had survived the long civil war met in <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION> to seek a settlement. After an overnight session, deputies <PERSON> Najah </PERSON> <PERSON> Wakim </PERSON>, an Orthodox Christian, and <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rifai </PERSON>, a Sunni, said Thursday they were optimistic. Voice of the People, a pro-Syrian radio station, said Christians would continue to fill the presidency but would have fewer powers. It said the president no longer would be able to issue general amnesties, could dissolve the parliament only once in his six-year term and would not be supreme military commander. The station said the military would rpeort to the Cabinet, traditionally led by a Sunni as prime minister. The reforms are designed to give more power to Moslems, who have become the majority since <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> gained independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1943. Druse chieftain <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>, leader of the Shiite Moslem militia Amal, have dismissed the Taif deliberations on grounds the proposals being considered do not give Moslems enough power. Both are allied with <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s two leading daily newspapers on Thursday denounced the idea of government talks with narcotics traffickers after assassins working for drug barons killed two newspaper employees. Because of fear on the part of truck drivers and delivery boys, one of the newspapers, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Espectador </LOCATION>, suspended home delivery in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, where the employees were killed Tuesday, a newspaper executive told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Many kiosks in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> were not selling <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Espectador </ORGANIZATION>, hotel employees and employees of other newspapers in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> said by telephone. Vendors who were selling it kept it stashed beneath counters and were slipping issues to customers like contraband, they said, speaking on condition of anonymity. <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, a city of 2 million people in northwestern <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, is the headquarters for the world's biggest cocaine cartel. <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Espectador </ORGANIZATION> said in a lead editorial that drug traffickers' suggestion of talks `` under their irrevocable threats of extermination and continuing their injustices if they are not not heard out would resemble a veritable surrender. The newspaper, whose publisher was murdered by drug traffickers three years ago, said it is too late to forgive and forget. <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiempo </PERSON>, also in a leading editorial, said <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Espectador </LOCATION> is experiencing `` the gravest threat against the freedom of the press in the entire history of our republic.'' On Wednesday a letter signed by <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON>, godfather of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel, asked for mediation by the press, political and church leaders and the judicial branch in a `` direct dialogue'' between the government and drug traffickers. The letter, addressed to <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Pastrana </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> newspaper in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, was read over the <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION> radio network. Drug traffickers claimed responsibility for the slayings Tuesday of the <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Espectador </ORGANIZATION> workers and threatened the kill the newspaper's 11 remaining employees in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiempo </PERSON> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Espectador </LOCATION> are fierce competitors in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> but have joined forces in the fight against drug traffickers and traditionally have supported each other in times of threats to the free press. <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tiempo </ORGANIZATION> has a daily circulation of 350,000 and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Espectador </LOCATION> 285,000. Both papers have called for government action against drug cartels, but <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Espectador </ORGANIZATION> has been more outspoken, calling the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> congress cowardly for not getting involved in the fight. There have been accusations that some congressmen have been elected with contributions from drug traffickers. <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> was a backup member of the congress from 1982 to 1986. Each congressman is elected along with a backup member to vote when the real congressman is not present, which is frequent. On Sept. 2, a car bomb exploded alongside the <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Espectador </LOCATION> building, seriously damaging the building and forcing the newspaper to suspend advertising and cut back on the size of the paper. The newspaper closed its office in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> on Wednesday and said it will remain closed until the newspaper can figure out what to do about security. The government said Thursday it had captured two more suspected drug traffickers and was holding them while the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> decides if it wanted to extradite them. The suspects were identified by <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s federal <ORGANIZATION> Administrative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scurity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> as <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leonidas </PERSON> <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON>. <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, is wanted in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on charges of participating in a money laundering operation. <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> was described by <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Espectador </PERSON> as chief of operations for the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel's vast operation of jungle laboratories in southern <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities have not said if he is wanted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> has extradited one suspected trafficker to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> during the 8-week-old war on traffickers.

 Israeli security forces killed four Palestinians in the occupied territories Thursday and wounded 18, including a 3-year-old whose skull was shattered, Arabs and the army reported. The shrapnel-riddled body of another <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> was taken to <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> hospital in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said he apparently was killed while preparing a bomb. <PERSON> Nuhzu </PERSON> <PERSON> Mabruka </PERSON>, 35, was found hacked to death in an alley in the <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> central market. Arab reporters said she was killed because she was a prostitute. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio described her as a collaborator with the Israelis. Military spokesmen said an Israeli patrol encountered Palestinian guerrillas in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> before dawn and fired, killing one. <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> radio said the two other guerrillas in the group escaped. Much of Thursday's violence occurred in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town that has been a center of rebellion during the 22-month-old uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation. Arab journalists reported many confrontations between Palestinians and soldiers. Hospital officials said 13 Arabs from <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> and nearby refugee camps were treated for gunshot wounds. Border police patrolling <LOCATION> Jenin </LOCATION> refugee camp fatally shot a 20-year-old man who tried to hurl a cement block down on them, the army said. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, army gunfire reportedly killed one Palestinian and wounded five. Doctors at <LOCATION> Shifa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> said 3-year-old <PERSON> Atiyyah </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Ghurani </PERSON> of Shati refugee camp was hit in the head by a rubber bullet that shattered his skull. Army spokesmen said the child was taken to <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hashomer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> in critical condition and circumstances of the shooting were being investigated. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers or civilians have slain at least 591 Palestinians since the uprising began on Dec. 8, 1987. Forty Israelis have been killed. Fellow Arabs have killed 128 Palestinians, most of them on suspicion of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities or for prostitution or drug dealing. The encounter in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> took place in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-declared security zone, near <LOCATION> Markabe </LOCATION>, a village 1 -LCB- miles north of the border, the army said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said the guerrillas had planned an ambush in the security zone, which is patrolled by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers and a surrogate militia of Lebanese Christians. Military sources said the dead man belonged to the Democratic Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION>, a Syrian-backed faction of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. The army said 71 guerrillas and two <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers have been killed in the border area this year.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will nominate acting Chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON> to run the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> rather than <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>, the candidate chosen by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, a newspaper reported Thursday. The Atlanta Constitution quoted congressional and administration sources as saying <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>, an ardent critic of government and industry safety practices, will not get the nomination. <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>, whose term on the board expires in December 1990, was renominated as chairman by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1988, but <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON> became acting chairman when the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> failed to act on <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>'s nomination <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> had served as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> since 1982. <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON>, contacted in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said he had heard no word of an appointment but he was `` hopeful and encouraged'' by the reports. Both <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON> and <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> have said they want the job and have deplored the delay in appointment of a permanent chairman. Last week, Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammerschmidt </PERSON>, R-Ark., said chances of <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>'s reappointment were not good because he is opposed by Sen. <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, D-Ky., chairman of a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> aviation subcommittee that regularly deals with the <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON>, former head of corporate communications for <ORGANIZATION> Frontier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, has <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s backing for the job, the newspaper said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Galipault </PERSON>, president of the non-profit <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, rated <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> among the board's best chairmen and said he was worried that the agency could lose some of its independence without his leadership. `` Without an effective leader, the board could lose its independence and be owned by somebody else _ the airlines or whoever,'' he said. <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON> has been acting director since August 1988, after <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> failed to win senatorial approval for a fourth two-year term. <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>, who acquired a reputation as a strong, independent safety advocate, is believed to have angered <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> aviation subcommittee, with a speech blasting <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s proposal to separate the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> from the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>

<HEAD>Discovery of New Green River Victim Part of Routine for Investigators</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The discovery of a new victim in the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> serial-killing case gave detectives some fresh leads, but few hopes were raised with 40 other deaths unsolved, the chief investigator said Thursday. The skeleton of <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Childers </PERSON>, who was 19 when she disappeared in 1983, was found Wednesday by a worker cutting brush just 50 yards from where three other victims had been uncovered six years ago near <LOCATION> Seattle-Tacoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. Police believe the killer in the nation's worst unsolved serial-murder case has not operated in the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> area since 1984. In addition to the 41 known victims, eight young missing women are listed as presumed victims. Ms. <PERSON> Childers </PERSON> had not been on that missing list, but the <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> had information about her because she was reported missing in 1983, said King County Police Capt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, the task force commander. Investigators were n't surprised that she turned out to be a <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> victim and that her skeleton was found in an area heavily searched previously, <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said. `` If you go back to our experience with recovering bodies _ waiting two years before a family member calls and says, ` I think you ought to look at this' _ it's just not unexpected anymore. ... Everything has some sort of a bizarre twist.'' Few personal details about Ms. <PERSON> Childers </PERSON> were available, but <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said she fit the profile of other <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> victims. Those killed were young women, most with links to prostitution. <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> police had at least one contact with Ms. <PERSON> Childers </PERSON>, when they arrested her on March 14, 1983, on a prostitution charge, <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> police spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Amundson </PERSON> said. One month later, <PERSON> Edmonds </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, police received a missing person report about Ms. <PERSON> Childers </PERSON>. She was last seen by her boyfriend as she was on her way to a shopping area frequented by prostitutes near the airport, police said. Many <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> victims were known to frequent the `` <LOCATION> Sea-Tac </LOCATION> strip'' near the airport south of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. `` The time of disappearance, what little we know now about the background of the victim is similar to a lot of our victims,'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said. `` The location ... the circumstances of the found victim, those kinds of things are certainly indicative of a <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> victim.'' The missing person report on Ms. <PERSON> Childers </PERSON> was among hundreds that <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> investigators had collected as they strove to identify several victims found earlier. However, <PERSON> Edmonds </PERSON> police later withdrew the missing-person report, saying a witness had reported seeing Ms. <PERSON> Childers </PERSON> crossing the Canadian border. The Green River killings occurred from the summer of 1982 to early 1984. The killer operated primarily in the Puget Sound area; the bodies of the first five victims were found near the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, giving the case its name. No arrests have been made, but <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, 38, of <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>, has been described by task force investigators as a `` viable suspect.'' He has been jailed in <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> on federal weapons charges but he has not been charged in connection with the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> killings.

 When two brothers pleaded guilty to drug charges, the judge did n't throw the book at them _ he just told them to read 10 books.

The <ORGANIZATION> McQueens </ORGANIZATION>, who pleaded guilty Wednesday to cocaine possession charges, were given a suspended sentence of one year and a day, in addition to five years supervised probation, which the judge said could be revoked if they failed to do their book reports or keep their diaries. He also said the sentences would remain suspended so long as they hold jobs and obey the law. <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Clay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jurist serving in the <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> circuit as a visiting judge, said he has been imposing book-reading sentences for about nine months to a year in his rural circuit. He said generally he sentences defendants to read books or keep diaries `` for the educational value. I do n't think corrections is doing enough.'' The judge startled the courtroom when he imposed the novel sentence. `` As the sentence was being read, I looked around the courtroom and people's eyes were getting big,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Belser </PERSON>, the assistant district attorney who handled the case. `` People were nodding in the affirmative, ` That's great.''' Given the normal course of criminal justice system proceedings, he said, the sentence was `` a breath of fresh air.'' But <PERSON> Elna </PERSON> <PERSON> Reese </PERSON>, defense attorney for <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> McQueen </PERSON>, said Thursday the judge would be asked to reconsider the sentence. She said five years probation for first offenders was too harsh.

 A small fire near a 900-gallon acid vat at a suburban aerospace complex Thursday prompted the evacuation of about 1,000 workers, officials said. There were no significant injuries reported at the <ORGANIZATION> Rocketdyne </ORGANIZATION> plant in <LOCATION> Canoga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, but about 40 people who were in the area of the fire were given emergency showers and six were taken to hospitals for precautionary checks.

The fire broke out on wooden grating near a 900-gallon vat of hydrofluoric acid and was extinguished by company employees at about 9:30 a.m., said city Fire Department spokesman <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Acevedo </PERSON>. None of the acid spilled, he said.

<TEXT>
 A state appeals court refused Thursday to allow enforcement of a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> law that would require an unmarried minor to get consent from a parent or a judge before having an abortion. The 1st District Court of Appeal did not decide if the law was constitutional, but upheld a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> judge's decision that abortion-rights groups had shown a likelihood of overturning the law on privacy grounds. Enforcement of the law is to remain blocked at least until the case goes to trial, unless the ruling is overturned by the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Among other things, the court said, abortion-rights supporters offered evidence `` which indicates that all but a very few adolescent minors have the capacity for exercising mature judgment concerning the wisdom of an abortion,'' and that the parental-consent requirement would cause potentially dangerous delays. If that evidence proves true, the court said, it would tend to show that the law invaded minors' privacy without being justified by a `` compelling state interest.'' `` Since -LRB- the law -RRB- will severely impair, or totally deny, the exercise of an intimate and fundamental constitutional right, the burden at trial will be upon -LRB- state officials -RRB- to prove they have a compelling interest in the regulation of unemancipated minors' consent to an abortion,'' said Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> in a 3-0 decision The plaintiffs in the lawsuit were doctors, individual minors and abortion-rights supporters. The ruling continues a ban on enforcement of the law, which was scheduled to take effect in January 1988 but was blocked a few days earlier by a <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge. The appellate decision relied on <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s constitutional right of privacy, passed by voters in 1972. The court followed previous rulings that the state constitutional right is broader than federal privacy rights, and rejected the state's arguments that privacy protections do not extend equally to minors. The ruling comes after a recent <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision overturning that state's parental consent law, also on state privacy grounds. The use of the state Constitution is important because similar laws in other states have been upheld by federal courts under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> constitutional standards. The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> law would prohibit an unmarried woman under 18, living at home, from getting an abortion without the consent of one parent. As an alternative, she could go to a judge, who would allow the abortion based on a conclusion that the minor was mature enough to make the decision or that it was in her best interest. State officials have said 34,000 women under 18 got abortions in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in 1985, the most recent figures available. The case could give the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s new majority, appointed by anti-abortion Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>, a chance to re-examine the scope of state privacy rights. Deciding what he described as the only issue before the court, <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> said the lower court judge did not abuse his discretion in deciding that opponents of the law had met the standard for an injunction blocking its enforcement: that enforcement would cause `` irreparable harm'' and that they had a likelihood of proving at trial that the law was unconstitutional. Attorney General <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON>, the lead defendant in the case, had argued that an invasion of a minor's privacy could be justified by a `` significant state interest.'' <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> and his colleagues disagreed, saying the state must show a `` compelling interest,'' the standard that also applies to adults. `` There is no argument that the protection of minors from physical, psychological and emotional harm manifests a comeplling state interest,'' <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> said.

 Seven Latin American presidents pledged Thursday to fight international drug trafficking and condemned the regime of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. In a declaration issued at the end of a two-day summit, the Group of <ORGANIZATION> Eight </ORGANIZATION> presidents also urged that <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> be readmitted to the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It did not elaborate. The <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> expelled <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> in 1961 after accusing <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> of openly exporting revolution. The communique issued by the Latin American presidents marked the first formal suggestion that <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> be allowed to rejoin the group. The `` Declaration of Ica'' was issued by presidents <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanguinetti </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> after the meeting in this remote desert city 180 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. The communique expressed the presidents' regret over `` the violation of human rights and the absence of democracy'' in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and said they would ask the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> to send a commission to that nation to investigate. The presidents said <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> would remain suspended from the Group of Eight, formed two years ago as a regional consulting organization, until it `` respects once again the democratic guarantees that today are absolutely ignored.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> foiled a coup attempt last week. The declaration also said the presidents will use `` all resources available'' to help the coca-producing Andean nations of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> in their battle against the region's cocaine cartels The three nations produce nearly all of the world's cocaine. `` The elimination of these activities requires an integral focus, the coordination between producing countries and consuming countries, and the elaboration of special proposals,'' the declaration said. It did not specifically mention <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug policy, but the presidents said repeatedly during the meeting that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s emphasis on using police and the military to stop cocaine smuggling in the Andean countries was insufficient to halt the drug traffic `` We wo n't get anywhere putting the brakes on production of the raw material in countries like <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not provide help and resources for substituting this type of product in the producing countries,'' <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> said at a news conference earlier Thursday. In his welcoming address, <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said: `` The origin of this problem is in the demand in the large industrialized nations.'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> was even stronger in his criticism of the focus of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s strategy, which provides for $ 261 million in aid, mainly in the form of helicopters and weapons, to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> `` The more demand grows in the North, the more production will grow in the South. Police actions will be useless unless demand is reduced,'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said Wednesday. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Barco </ORGANIZATION> and President <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> met here Tuesday before the beginning of the Group of Eight gathering and agreed to invite <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to a drug summit, to be held within three months in a Latin American nation. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> accepted immediately. The three presidents said that drug trafficking could not be halted until production and consupmtion are curbed. <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> have urged greater <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic development aid to generate alternative sources of income for the hundreds of thousands of peasants who make their living from growing coca, the raw material for cocaine. `` The best allies that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> could have in his fight against drug addiction would be the campesinos themselves,'' <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said at a news conference Thursday. `` Ours is not a military war. It's an economic war.''

 <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, the vice president's wife, spoke at a fund-raiser for breast cancer prevention and tearfully recalled her mother's death from the disease. Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said Wednesday that her mother's death 16 years ago at age 56 could have been prevented with early detection and treatment. She spoke to about 2,000 people at the annual luncheon of the <ORGANIZATION> Susan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Komen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, which since 1982 has raised more than $ 6 million for breast cancer research programs, education and awareness projects and screening centers across the country. `` My mother lost her battle. ... I'm resolved to help win her war ... in the name of <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Komen </PERSON> and in the name of my mother,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. She sobbed for several moments as she embraced <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinker </PERSON>, founding chairwoman of the <ORGANIZATION> Komen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. The organization was named for Mrs. <PERSON> Brinker </PERSON>'s sister, who died of breast cancer at age 36. Breast cancer is the leading cause of death in women ages 35 to 50. Many in the audience were in tears by the time Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> finished her 18-minute keynote address. `` Fear is the greatest obstacle to early detection and treatment of breast cancer,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. `` We are here today to vanish that fear.'' She said her mother, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, had always been `` too busy'' to properly care for her medical needs. Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said her mother was told by a family doctor that a lump on her breast was probably benign. However, when surgery was performed six months later, the cancer had spread to her lymphatic system. `` The woman died a few months later. She was 56 years old. She was my mother,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. `` My mother's story does not have to be repeated.''

<TEXT>
 Eighty-eight percent of voters dotted about this remote <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> archipelago chose a legislative council this week, undeterred by lack of roads and helped by one overworked pilot hopping islands to collect ballots. In <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>, the capital and only town of this British colony of 1,800 people, 82 percent of registered voters cast ballots in a 4-day election that ended with a vote-count Wednesday night. The numerous islands cover 4,700 square miles, 300 miles east of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and 8,000 miles from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Because of the almost total absence of roads in the farm areas of this sheep-raising community, election officials visited sites outside the capital by plane and Land Rover so farmers could vote. The government air service, crippled by recent resignations, had to rely entirely on veteran pilot <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Alsopp </PERSON>, who was recruited on an emergency basis from the <LOCATION> Shetland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. Ninety-four percent of the total farm electorate of 553 voted. Eighteen candidates stood for the eight council seats _ four to represent <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> and four the farming community. All the candidates stressed their total opposition to resuming any contacts with <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, let alone any discussions of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s claim to sovereignty over the <LOCATION> Falklands </LOCATION>, the issue that brought <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> to war for six weeks in 1982. However, a general feeling of support was shown for improved relations between <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. The first substantive talks between the two former combatants are to take place in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> Oct. 17-18. Winning candidate <PERSON> Terence </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON>, decorated for bravery in assisting the British forces that drove out the Argentine occupation, cautioned against forging economic links with <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. `` We are content to trade with other Latin American countries, but we want nothing to do with <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>,'' he said.

About 300 protesters began the demonstration at midday at the statue of <PERSON> Cuauhtemoc </PERSON>, the last of the <LOCATION> Aztec </LOCATION> emperors, who were conquered by the Spaniards in the 16th century. After dancers in colorful indigenous costumes and feathered headdress paid tribute to the native chief, the protesters walked the two blocks to the <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> statue, where they chanted slogans, threw flowers at a few dozen police officers and desroyed the wreaths. There were no violent incidents during the protest, which lasted only a few minutes. Protesters called <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> a killer and shouted that the police should stop harassing citizens. Some marchers handed out handbills alleging government repression of peasants. `` We call on the public not to let our dignity be trampled,'' the leaflets said. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> observes Columbus Day as `` Dia de la Raza,'' Day of the Races, honoring the nation's racial mix. The majority of Mexicans have indigenous and European blood. Last year's celebration resulted in a melee, when leftist protesters at the <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> statue threw rocks at police.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> beat the drum for Republican candidates from the <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Gracie </LOCATION> Mansion Thursday, ending up by urging <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yorkers </LOCATION> to vote for `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s greatest crime-fighter'' _ mayoral hopeful <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> capped a day of campaigning with an effusive speech at a fund-raising dinner in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> expected to reap upwards of $ 1 million for <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, a former federal prosecutor. Polls indicate he is trailing badly in his bid to keep Democrat <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> from becoming <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s first black mayor. Painting a bleak picture of a city beset by `` neighborhood tensions,'' crumbling bridges, homelessness and a declining school system, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON>'s the one to turn around <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.''

 Police and firemen used electric prods and water cannon Thursday to disperse about 500 people preparing to march on congress to demand land for landless peasants. The marchers, organized by peasant organizations and labor unions, gathered in a downtown plaza in preparation for the 10-block march. Witnesses said hundreds of police and firemen blocked streets out of the plaza and used force when marchers tried to break through police lines. `` We are complying with ministerial orders,'' Gen. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, chief of <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION> police, told reporters at the scene. `` There is a regulation that prohibits demonstrations in the city's downtown area. An <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> decree issued in April bans all large gatherings downtown on grounds they hinder traffic. After initial police efforts to contain the marchers, officers and march organizers agreed 30 marchers could walk to congress to present a petition. Many more people tried to join the procession, however, and this time police responded with clubs and blasts from water cannon to disperse them. Gen. <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> ousted former dictator <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> in a Feb. 3 coup and was installed as president after winning May 1 elections.

 The widow of the officer who led the failed coup against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said Thursday that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials were notified of the attempt and agreed to help, then caused a fatal delay. <PERSON> Adela </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonilla </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON>, 36, took refuge at a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> base during the coup and later fled the country after her husband, Maj. <PERSON> Moises </PERSON> <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON>, was executed by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> loyalists. On Oct. 1, two days before the coup, Mrs. <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON> had a friend arrange a meeting with a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> army colonel at the friend's house to inform them and ask for help in isolating <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s downtown headquarters. `` What my husband wanted was for them to overfly -LRB- Panamanian -RRB- air force bases ... so that no one could leave,'' she said. `` And also to close off the roads'' around the headquarters. The colonel made arrangements with two civilian-clad <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, who then met privately with her husband, she said. After the meeting, without revealing details, her husband said everything had been agreed and that the coup would be Oct. 3, according to Mrs. <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON>, who did not attend the meeting. `` My husband told me they made an agreement,'' she said. `` He told me there were no problems, we were going ahead, and that everything would turn out well.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials gave him a number, she said, telling him to call them any time during the coup to request help. But during the coup, when the rebels seized temporary control of the headquarters and imprisoned <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, her husband's ally, Capt. <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Licona </PERSON>, had little success when he picked up the phone. `` When the call was made to tell them that Capt. <PERSON> Licona </PERSON> wanted to talk to them, to report, they did n't believe the call,'' she said. `` He had to go to <PERSON> Fort </PERSON> <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> to assure them he was himself. A lot of time was lost.''

She said he intially cooperated with the coup, letting <PERSON> Licona </PERSON> go to <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clayton </LOCATION>, then switched sides. Mrs. <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON> strongly disputed statements made by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in interviews published Thursday saying that the plotters had received large sums from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` If they had paid the sum of $ 1 million, where is it?'' she said. She denied that any of the officers involved in the coup had been promised money by her husband or the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 You ca n't always get what you want when you ask the government. <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, wanted $ 6.9 million to help build a rock' n' roll Hall Of Fame But the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> said the museum will have to rock without the federal bankroll, and <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said Thursday there's no way he'll change his mind. `` My children love rock' n' roll. I love rock' n' roll. But I have no discretion,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` The rock' n' roll museum is a worthwhile project for <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> and rock' n' roll but it could n't meet the criteria for a UDAG grant,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said. `` There is no possibility of a UDAG grant for the rock' n' roll museum.'' <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> two weeks ago rejected the request for an Urban Development Action <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> to build an 18-story glass pyramid to display rock' n' roll memorabilia Rep. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakar </PERSON>, a Democrat whose district includes part of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, had hoped to persuade <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> the project was worthy of discretionary funds. She was visibly annoyed Thursday when <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> brought up the request during a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> discussion of unrelated <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> grant programs. Later in the day <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> called Oakar to clear the air. `` He apologised for misunderstanding what I was getting at,'' Oakar said. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> confirmed that he apologised to <LOCATION> Oakar </LOCATION>. He said he expressed his friendship and desire to work with <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> on housing programs. But <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> stressed that he made no promises and held out no hope for the music museum. `` I have no discretionary money,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said. `` I do n't want people to be calling me for discretionary political decisions. `` There is nothing that I can do about the rock' n' roll museum aside from urging the private sector and the rock' n' roll musicians and the music industry to put up some more money,'' he said. Oakar sees the $ 48 million project as the city's best hope for putting 600 people to work while turning a decaying warehouse district into a glistening tourist draw. Hall of Fame officials have estimated that the museum will attract as many as 700,000 visitors and up to $ 85 million in revenue each year. The New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Rock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> And </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roll </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> has set a Nov. 15 deadline for the city to raise $ 40 million in construction money. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s denial cast doubt on whether the city would be able to meet the deadline. <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> is where late-night disc jockey <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Freed </PERSON> introduced a generation of teeny-boppers to the term rock' n' roll. The city has approved the sale of $ 18 million of tax-exempt bonds to pay for construction, the state promised to kick in about $ 4.4 million, <LOCATION> Cuyahoga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> committed $ 5 million and corporations and other donors pledged $ 7.4 million.

 Fire ravaged a six-story downtown building Thursday and spread to neighboring buildings as firefighters contended with exploding fireworks and low water pressure. There were no reports of serious injuries. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Fasana </PERSON>, chief of <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, said four firefighters suffered minor injuries and two bystanders were treated for mild smoke inhalation. Fire Department spokesman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said the fire broke out about 11:45 a.m. in a brick building with a food store on the bottom floor a section of the congested <LOCATION> Chinatown </LOCATION> neighborhood. It was brought under control by 5 p.m.. More than 100 firefighters were called to the scene as thick smoke sailed over the city's skyline The fire spread to a commercial building next door and ignited fireworks stored there, setting off as many as 29 explosions, said <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stapleton </PERSON>, the city fire commissioner. Firefighters had to be evacuated from the second building, he said. The blaze also spread to a third Deputy Fire Chief <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> said firefighters had trouble getting adequate pressure in their hoses, and might otherwise have stopped the flames from spreading to other buildings. He said fire officials would check with the city's water department to determine the source of the trouble. <PERSON> Stapleton </PERSON> said the fire appeared to have started on the second floor of the six-story building, where it was reported people might have been using welding equipment.

 Two Canadians have pleaded guilty to scheming to illegally export aircraft parts to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and have agreed to testify against a Swedish man who prosecutors say masterminded the plot, authorities said. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON> <PERSON> Arab </PERSON>, 52, and his wife, <PERSON> Eileen </PERSON> <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Arab </PERSON>, 53, both of <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, each pleaded guilty Wednesday to one count of conspiracy to violate the Arms Export Control Act and one count of money laundering. They were arrested on May 25, along with <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Erick </PERSON> <PERSON> Nissen </PERSON>, 62, of <LOCATION> Norrkoping </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. All were charged with scheming to ship millions of dollars in aircraft parts and weapons to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.

 A <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> farmer received $ 116,000 for finding a 400-pound engine disk that may hold the key to July's DC-10 crash in <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, while a neighbor discovered the disk's missing part Thursday, officials said. `` I'm just in shock. I can manage $ 20,000, but this?'' <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorenson </PERSON> said after <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> officials sent a check to her two-story farmhouse about 10 miles north of <LOCATION> Alta </LOCATION>. She said company officials told her another check for $ 3,225 will follow. GE had offered a $ 50,000 reward for the titanium fan disk from the rear engine of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> Flight 232 that crashed July 19 while trying to land at <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, killing 112 of 296 the people on board. GE manufactured the engine, and experts believe the disk could have caused the crash. <LOCATION> Alta </LOCATION> is 50 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The amount given to Mrs. <PERSON> Sorenson </PERSON> is more than $ 50,000 because <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> had said it would pay extra for the 25 fan blades and other parts still attached to the disk and because some other small parts were found nearby. Mrs. <PERSON> Sorenson </PERSON> discovered about two-thirds of the fan disk assembly while harvesting corn on her farm Tuesday. On Thursday afternoon, <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Halverson </PERSON>, who farms about a half mile north of the Sorensons, found the missing third while driving a tractor in his corn field. `` I was n't looking for it at all. I just happened to hit the disk with it,'' <PERSON> Halverson </PERSON> said. `` It was n't buried deep'cause the disk tipped it right up.'' <PERSON> Halverson </PERSON> said he contacted GE officials, who carted the part away. The part weighed about 100 pounds and had 10 fan blades or parts of blades attached to it. `` They said it would fit right into what is missing,'' he said. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadd </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> lawyer hired by <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> to assist in the search, confirmed that <PERSON> Halverson </PERSON> had found the missing portion of the fan disk. He said the company was deciding whether to call off the search effort. `` I know there are a number of small pieces still missing,'' he said. `` The reward system will continue in effect, there's no question about that. But it's whether or not <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> will continue a concerted search, that decision is being made right now and will be made quite promptly.'' GE established a reward fund totaling $ 271,000 to pay for airplane parts recovered from the crash, but had paid only about $ 6,000 before Mrs. <PERSON> Sorenson </PERSON>'s discovery, said company spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Sorenson </PERSON> said she had no plans on how she would spend the money, and <PERSON> Halverson </PERSON> said he does not know yet how much he has coming. The main part of the disk, which looks like a windmill, was flown Wednesday to a GE plant near <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> for analysis. Investigators suspect the fan disk came apart in midair, causing the engine to disintegrate and spew shrapnel that severed the jet's hydraulic system and made the plane virtually impossible to control The crippled airliner made it to the nearby <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> airport </LOCATION>, where it crashed during an emergency landing.

 A physician Thursday warned swimmers and surfers to beware after a shark reportedly 4 feet long attacked a 12-year-old surfer about 100 yards offshore. The boy, <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Largent </PERSON>, was in stable condition Thursday at a nearby hospital with three bites on one foot and leg. `` He was hurting a lot and lost a lot of blood, but he was n't screaming in pain,'' police Officer <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said `` If it had been me, I'd have been screaming bloody murder.

Friends with <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> told police the shark was about 4 feet long. <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said witnesses were not sure of the shark's species. `` The shark may still be out there tomorrow who knows?''

 Cartoon creator <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, whose Rocky the Flying Squirrel and <PERSON> Bullwinkle </PERSON> <PERSON> Moose </PERSON> brought hip humor and sophisticated satire to television cartoons, died Thursday of kidney cancer. He was 69. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> died at home with his wife, <PERSON> Ramona </PERSON>, and three children present, said <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>'s longtime publicist and friend <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandy </PERSON>. With his partner <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, who died four years ago, <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> created a world of memorable cartoon characters whose adventures delighted children without condescending to them and kept adults amused with witty wordplay. The quirky pantheon <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> and <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> created included the plucky Rocket J. Squirrel and sidekick <PERSON> Bullwinkle </PERSON> <PERSON> Moose </PERSON>; bumbling spies <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Badenov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Natasha </PERSON> <PERSON> Fatale </PERSON>; smarmy <PERSON> Dudley </PERSON> <PERSON> Doright </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Mounties </ORGANIZATION> and overacting villain Snidely Whiplash; Way-Back Machine inventor -LRB- and dog -RRB- Mr. <PERSON> Peabody </PERSON>, and his boy, <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON>. The characters were savvy, dumb, well-meaning, brave, flawed, and uttered atrocious puns as they helped or chased each other through unlikely situations in a series of cartoon shows by <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> and <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>. Their first effort was `` Rocky and His Friends'' for <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, which ran from 1959 through 1961. Rocky and <PERSON> Bullwinkle </PERSON>'s adventures, breathlessly narrated by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>, gleefully spoofed cliffhanging serials. From 1961 to 1962, <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> and <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> produced for <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> `` The Bullwinkle Show,'' believed to be the first prime-time cartoon segment for network television. The show ran until 1964, and its last network appearance, in reruns, was in 1982. The show featured `` Fractured Fairy Tales,'' `` Peabody's Improbable History,'' `` <PERSON> Aesop </PERSON> and Son,'' and `` Adventures of <PERSON> Dudley </PERSON> <PERSON> Doright </PERSON>,'' which eventually became its own series A <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> native, <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> went to the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> as an undergraduate studies, then attended <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> for a Master's Degree. He returned to his hometown and opened a real estate office, but on the first day of business a truck lost its brakes, rolled down a hill and into his office. He was pinned to a wall and both his legs were broken. `` Anybody who is in real estate in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and ca n't run, better get out of the business,'' Brandy said <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> joked with friends while he was recovering. During that period <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> and friend <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> invented the character of Crusader Rabbit, and decided to produce it for television. `` They were so untutored that the first show they shot was done upside down -LRB- on the film -RRB-'' said <PERSON> Brandy </PERSON>. `` Crusader Rabbit,'' the first cartoon show developed expressly for television, had <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>'s trademark puns and word play and was a hit after its introduction in 1949. After <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> left the cartoon business for advertising, <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> teamed with <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, to create the first `` Rocky and His Friends.'' Among the writers and creators who worked with the production company during the early 1960s were film director <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazursky </PERSON> and <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, later the Emmy-winning co-producer of `` The <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> Show,'' said <PERSON> Brandy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> and his associates also produced the Cap' n Crunch breakfast cereal commercials. His last cartoon series, `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> of the Jungle,'' ran from 1967 to 1970. `` He saw humor in everything and had one of those contagious laughs, a wonderful rolling laugh that had everyone laughing around him,'' said <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON> <PERSON> Fabregas </PERSON>, 42, who said her father loved impulsive wit. `` He got the name Bullwinkle from a car dealership,'' she said. `` He just drove by a car dealership in <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> and said, ` That's it That's the name!'' `` He felt very good about the shows he created, and that even 30 years later people were watching them,'' she said. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> always picked the clips for the numerous film festivals he was invited to, his daughter said. `` There have been a lot of film festivals in last four or five years. He knew exactly what pieces he wanted. He had an unbelieveably sharp brain, and a fabulous memory,'' she said. `` For all us kids, he was our fearless leader, and he was almost always right. He was a super father,'' she said. Besides his wife and daughter, <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> leaves sons <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carey </PERSON>. Funeral arrangements were incomplete.

 More than 100,000 people jammed the country's largest soccer stadium Thursday in a raucous show of support for pro-government presidential candidate <PERSON> Hernan </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchi </PERSON>. Earlier in the day, thousands of supporters of opposition candidate <PERSON> Patricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> filled a downtown street in a rally organized by the country's most powerful labor federation. Both demonstrations were largely peaceful and no injuries or arrests were reported. As the end of the opposition rally ended, some small groups clashed with police but were quickly dispersed with water cannon. The young crowd in the National Stadium cheered, chanted and waved banners for <PERSON> Buchi </PERSON>, 40, who was finance minister under right-wing military President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> for four years before resigning in April to campaign for the Dec. 14 elections. `` We are the future and we are going to win,'' <PERSON> Buchi </PERSON> told the crowd. The event appeared to provide badly needed momentum for <PERSON> Buchi </PERSON>, the underdog who has trailed <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> by as much as 30 points in opinion polls. An independent, <PERSON> Buchi </PERSON> is backed by the conservative political groups. He reiterated a charge that <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>, a Christian Democrat backed by a coalition of 17 centrist and leftist parties, is allied with violent Marxist groups and hinted that a labor activist killed in a hit-and-run accident in southern <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> this week was run down because he backed <PERSON> Buchi </PERSON>'s campaign. <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> denies soliciting Marxist support. Police say they have no evidence of a political motive in the accident. The street rally for <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>, about 15 blocks from the city's center, also drew a youthful crowd Over loudspeakers an organizer read a statement from <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bustos </PERSON>, leader of the Workers' <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION>, in which he declared that the organization would faithfully back <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bustos </PERSON> and his vice president, <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, were unable to attend because they are serving 541 days in internal exile in small towns. They were convicted of violating national security laws by calling a violence-marred general strike against the right-wing military government in 1987. <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, leader of the Solidarity free trade movement in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, plans a Sept. 26-28 visit to <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> to meet with <PERSON> Bustos </PERSON> and lobby for his freedom. <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>, a 70-year-old statesman, told the crowd he would fight for greater social justice. He said the workers' cause suffered severely during <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s 16 years of military rule. Also running is <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Errazuriz </PERSON>, a populist businessman who trails the other two candidates in the opinion polls. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, 73, seized power in a 1973 military coup that toppled an elected leftist government. In October 1988, voters rejected a referendum proposal that he remain in power eight more years. He was obliged to call elections. The new government will take over next March 11.

 Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> barred at least one covert operation in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> proposed by the administration, intelligence sources said Thursday. One member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> alluded to the congressional restrictions during debate on the appropriations bill for intelligence agencies, saying President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s cautious response to the coup was justified in part by interference from the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` Who could expect this administration or any administration, or any intelligence agencies, to make gutsy decisions when we have lashed them, put them under the whip, tethered them, told them they better not do anything?'' said Rep. <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> Shuster </PERSON>, R-Pa.

Other knowledgeable congressional sources said members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> had specifically barred the administration from exercising unspecified options that could have yielded better inside knowledge of the Panamanian Defense Forces. The administration had notified <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of the options in an intelligence `` finding,'' a document required to be given to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> before undertaking covert actions, the sources said. <PERSON> Shuster </PERSON> mentioned no lawmakers by name, but <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., later called <PERSON> Shuster </PERSON>'s remarks significant Referring to lawmakers critical of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s inaction _ a group that includes <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> _ <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> said there is `` plenty in the -LRB- classified -RRB- record ... to know that some of these people are going far beyond what they've got the right to say about the administration's requests in the past, what was granted and what was denied.'' In another development, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration denied <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s allegations the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> paid $ 1 million to rebel officers to launch last week's failed coup `` That's nonsense,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. `` Absurd,'' said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says it's absurd, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> says there's nothing to it and I say we do n't believe anything <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> says,'' <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Gulfport </LOCATION>, Miss. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> told reporters for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> in an interview Wednesday night that <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> investigators discovered a bank account in the name of Capt. <PERSON> Erick </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murillo </PERSON>, one of the alleged coup leaders, with more than $ 1 million. `` There was a lot of money there for a normal Panamanian,'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was quoted as saying. `` Six zeroes. It was a million dollar account.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said: `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was involved before, during and after the coup. They had to make the contacts, woo them, convince them. It's a lot of work before you've hooked the fish. But they were the hook and the useful fools were the fish.'' He also said Nicaraguan Contras delivered money and relayed messages between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials and coup plotters. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has said previously that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials were notified in advance by Panamanians involved in the coup but did not play a part in planning it. According to a remarks Thursday at <ORGANIZATION> Wichita </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackwill </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> staff member and 1962 graduate of the university, the coup plotters said they did n't want <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> help. `` Indeed they said they did n't wish for their effort to be tainted by <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> intervention,'' <PERSON> Blackwill </PERSON> said in answering questions after a speech. He said the <PERSON> Noreiga </PERSON> troops that crushed the coup arrived through the honeycomb of streets in the densely populated center of old <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intervention would have been difficult, he said. `` This is not putting a log over a tow path,'' he said. `` This would have been the deployment of American forces in the center of a foreign country, perhaps igniting a fight in which many civilians would have been killed.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has admitted blocking two other routes to the coup site. As for the accusation that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> used the Contras as go-betweens, Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said, `` That's the first I've ever heard of something like that.''

<HEAD>Bill Would Ban Ozone-Depleting Chemicals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The labor government introduced legislation Thursday that would phase out the use of most ozone-depleting chemicals within six years. Prime Minister <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> said the legislation would make <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> a world leader in environmental protection. `` It is essential to act quickly but not to panic,'' said <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, who also has the environment portfolio. `` We do not want to cause unnecessary disruption to industry but we must protect our environment.'' The Ozone Layer Protection Bill would ban 95 percent of harmful chemicals by 1995 and that they would be phased out depending on the availability of alternatives available to industry. <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> said all but a few essential uses of such chemicals would be banned by the year 2000. He did not elaborate. The chemicals _ chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, and halons _ are damaging the ozone layer above <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. Scientists say a thinner ozone shield allows more ultraviolet-B radiation to reach the earth's surface and poses a global environmental threat through skin cancer and changes to the marine life ecosystem. <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> said the legislation anticipated tougher international protocols that he expected by next year. `` With these measures in place, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> will be leading the way in action,'' he said. But opposition <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conservation spokesman <PERSON> Denis </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> of grandstanding and said the legislation was `` wimpish.'' `` In spite of claims by the Minister for the Environment that we are leading the world in saving the ozone layer by banning CFCs from spray cans, CFCs were banned from spray cans in the <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> 10 years ago,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 Guerrillas on Thursday claimed to have killed 190 Moroccan soldiers and wounded 150 during its attack near a desert outpost in the disputed <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION>. The Moroccan High Command claimed 101 Polisario Front fighters died in the `` suicide attack'' Wednesday on the defense line at <LOCATION> Hauza </LOCATION>, 30 miles south of the Moroccan border, and that 11 Moroccans, including an officer, were killed. Moroccan officials said the guerrillas' casualty claims were propaganda. `` This is their habitual tactic,'' said one Moroccan army officer. `` They claim an impossible number of Moroccan casualties to conceal their own serious losses.'' A statement issued in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> Polisario </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> said among those killed in Wednesday's pre-dawn battle was Lt. <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Charboudi </PERSON>, while 36 Moroccans, including Capt. <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hadroui </PERSON>, were taken prisoner. Polisario said nothing about its own casualties. Wednesday's raid followed a bloody tank battle Saturday in which <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> said a colonel and 13 other soldiers were killed at Guelta Zenmour, a town central <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> near the Mauritanian border. The new Polisario offensive coincides with a pending vote in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> on whether to hold a referendum among the 80,000 inhabitants registered as living in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> before <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> pulled out in 1975. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> has been seeking a solution to the 14-year-old struggle between <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> and the Polisario for control of the vast mineral-rich territory. The Polisario had observed a self-imposed cease-fire since February which was intended to allow peace talks with <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> a chance to succeed <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> later broke off the talks, calling them `` pointless.'' A Polisario official in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> said the king's decision forced the guerrillas to `` reluctantly take up arms again.'' But the official Moroccan news agency said the king had canceled a new round of talks to have been held in <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> because of the latest Polisario attacks. Moroccan officials in <LOCATION> Rabat </LOCATION> said the Polisario no longer enjoys the strong Algerian backing it once had, and as a result has been forced to move its main military supply base from the Algerian oasis of <LOCATION> Tindouf </LOCATION>, near the Moroccan border, to the Mauritanian outpost of <LOCATION> Bir </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moghrein </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Bir </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moghrein </LOCATION> lies south of <LOCATION> Hauza </LOCATION> and east of <LOCATION> Guelta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zemour </LOCATION>. Moroccan military officials believe attacks on both points were launched from <LOCATION> Bir </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moghrein </LOCATION>, an area of northern <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION> with virtually no government troops. Moroccan press reports earlier in the week warned that <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON>'s troops might exercise `` hot pursuit'' into <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION> unless the neighboring nation takes action against the Polisario forces Most of the 10,000-strong Mauritanian army is deployed in the south facing <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION>. Most of Polisario's military supplies from various leftist Third World sources presently arrive at the <LOCATION> Mauritanian </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Nouadhibou </LOCATION>, where they are unloaded there by Polisario sympathizers, diplomatic sources said.

<HEAD>GOP Candidate Accuses Democrat of Insensitivity to Women</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate for governor is airing advertisements on issues of interest to women, including a commercial portraying his Democratic opponent as insensitive to rape victims. Former state Attorney General <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>'s ad, first aired Wednesday, says Lt. Gov. <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> introduced a bill in 1972 that would have allowed defense lawyers to interrogate rape victims ages 13 and under about their sex lives. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>'s campaign calls the commercial <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>'s `` most vicious and untruthful ... to date.'' The 30-second commercial, produced by nationally prominent Republican advertising consultant <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, shows a court scene in which a supposed rape victim is questioned by a defense attorney. The female announcer says: `` Remembering, after the rape. The ordeal of questioning by the rapist's lawyer. It was <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> who introduced a bill to force rape victims age 13 and under to be interrogated about their private lives by lawyers for accused rapists. So, next time Mr. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> talks about the rights of women, ask him about the law he tried to pass.'' <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> also released an ad emphasizing his commitment to tax credits for child care and expanded day care for working parents in state government. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> during a televised debate Monday night of being insensitive to women by trying to spread fear that the Republican would seek to restrict abortions if he wins the Nov. 7 election. Published polls show the majority of voters share <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>'s view that the state's abortion laws should be left alone following a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision freeing the states to enact new restrictions on abortion. Polls on the governor's race show <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> about even with <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, who is trying to become the nation's first black elected governor. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> press secretary <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dillard </PERSON> said the bill, which failed, was intended to broaden the age category for statutory rape. At the time <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> introduced the bill in the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> law said a defendant could not be convicted of the statutory rape of a girl between the ages of 14 and 16 if the judge or jury determined she had consented or was lewd or of bad moral repute. The bill submitted by <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> extended the age category to include girls under age 14. <PERSON> Dillard </PERSON> said that defense attorneys, in rape cases involving minors, had already been free to question victims about their sexual history.

 Radical students armed with firebombs and tear gas briefly occupied part of <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>'s residence early Friday before riot police dragged them out, officials said. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> and his wife were not injured in the attack. Police said six male students belonging to an `` anti-U.S. death squad'' scaled the walls of <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>'s residential compound and hurled tear gas at guards who tried to stop them from rushing the home. The students locked themselves inside one building and held off riot police for about 30 minutes before troops firing tear gas smashed down a door and seized them, police said. `` Drive out the <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION>!'' the students screamed as police hustled them away. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Meg </PERSON>, said at a news conference they were in bed about 6:30 a.m. when they heard a blast and a guard warned them by telephone that intruders had entered the compound, which is about one mile from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy. The <PERSON> Greggs </PERSON> said they heard the intruders on the other side of their locked bedroom door, but were able to escape the house by another entrance and avoid an encounter with the students. The students however caused extensive damage in the living room, smashing artwork and pottery, <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> said. He said though that the incident would have no impact on U.S.-South Korean relations and that the students represented a vocal minority. `` This was the act of six people who broke into our house,'' <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> said. Police said the intruders were armed with firebombs, tear gas and steel bars. <PERSON> Yonhap </PERSON>, the South Korean news agency, said the protesters also carried paint thinner and what it described as a crude homemade explosive. Police said the intruders did not use any weapons except for one tear gas grenade they detonated when forcing their way into the compound in central <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Damage from the tear gas grenade, which were apparently captured police equipment, was described as minor. The students, who came from three colleges in the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> area, demanded a meeting with <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> to press for an end to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade pressure on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, police said. They shouted `` Punish <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>!'' and `` We oppose <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade pressure!'' At least one student was draped in a South Korean national flag. The students also demanded South Korean President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo call off his proposed trip Sunday to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for talks with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> leaders. Radical students have opposed <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>'s close ties with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, demanding <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> stop pressuring <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to accept more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> products. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been seeking greater access to South Korean markets to help correct its huge trade imbalance with <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. The radicals opposed <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>'s appointment as ambassador because he was a former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> station chief in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> in the 1970s. They claim <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>, who arrived in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> last month, was sent to help bolster the conservative South Korean government. The attack on his home came two days after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> after talks with South Korean officials. Hills and other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have demanded <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> drop its import barriers. Radical students have attacked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomatic facilities in the past, but most of the incidents have been minor and no Americans have been seriously hurt. The radicals are demanding the withdrawal of the 43,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops based in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, but they have little public support because of their extreme political views. Their support has declined further in recent months because of their sympathy for rival communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> served as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s national security adviser when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was vice president. He was one of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s first ambassadorial nominations, but met significant opposition in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> because of disputes over his role, if any, in the Iran-Contra affair. He was not confirmed until September, nine months after the nomination, and the vote was only 66-33 in his favor.

<HEAD>Yusupov Scores Victory Over Karpov to Level Match at 2.5-2.5</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Artur </PERSON> <PERSON> Yusupov </PERSON> scored a 37-move victory over fellow Soviet <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> in the fifth round of the World Chess Championship Candidates' semifinal Thursday to even the match at 2.5 points apiece. In a frantic time scramble, <PERSON> Yusupov </PERSON>, playing white, unleashed a dramatic bishop sacrifice that tied black's pieces in knots and helped win <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON>'s queen seven moves later. When <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> resigned, the audience in the <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON>'s Wells ballet theater rose for a standing ovation punctuated with cheers and cries of `` bravo.'' `` It was a truly godlike performance. Really courageous,'' said International Master <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Tisdall </PERSON>. `` I've never been so excited watching the end of a game,'' exclaimed British grandmaster <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Short </PERSON>. `` Fantastic. What a glorious move.'' <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON>, 38, held the world championship crown for 10 years until 1985 and it was widely predicted he would crush his 29-year-old opponent in the eight-game contest. The winner of the Candidates cycle will challenge world champion <PERSON> Garri </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> for his title in a 24-game match starting October 1990. The winning semifinalists will face off in the Candidates' final next March A win scores 1 point and a draw one-half. In the other semifinal, <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Speelman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> took a timeout Thursday postponing his seventh game against Dutch grandmaster <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Timman </PERSON> until Saturday. With two games remaining, <PERSON> Timman </PERSON> leads 3.5-2 .5 <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON>'s problems began early in the opening, when a faulty fourth move let <PERSON> Yusupov </PERSON> gain an enduring positional edge. Several commentators said <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> had suffered a lapse of memory. <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> has `` a memory like a sieve, that's all,'' said <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Sosonko </PERSON>, a Dutch grandmaster who emigrated from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1971 and is on good terms with the former world champion. <PERSON> Yusupov </PERSON> entrenched a knight on a fine outpost in the center of the board, which he later replaced with a bishop. But <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> gradually battled his way out of difficulties and by the 22nd move, experts were predicting the game would end in a draw. But at move 30, with only eight minutes' thinking time left to play 10 moves, <PERSON> Yusupov </PERSON> flashed out his brilliant sacrifice. <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> tried desperately to unravel his pieces, but after a weak 34th move, playing with less than a minute left to make seven moves, he was unable to prevent a decisive penetration by <PERSON> Yusupov </PERSON>'s queen and a rook With Friday a free day, the sixth game will be played Saturday with <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> scheduled to play with the advantage of the white pieces. If either contest ends in a 4-4 tie, two more games will be played, followed if necessary by sudden death tiebreakers at increasingly high speeds.

<HEAD>Investigators Find Pre-Flight Crack in DC-10 Part</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Eds: SUBS grafs 7-8 bgng: ``The farmer,'' to reflect payment of
reward to Ms. Sorenson. ^By DAVID BRISCOE ^Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal safety investigators said Thursday they had found a pre-flight crack in the DC-10 engine disk recovered from an <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> corn field nearly three months after the crash of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> Flight 232. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON>, acting chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, said the precise `` size, nature and reason for the crack'' were not yet determined. But he said investigators are hopeful further examination of the engine part will lead to a cause of the July 19 crash that killed 112 of 296 people aboard as the plane was landing at the <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, airport. `` There has been no determination on whether this crack was detectable before the accident, nor has there been a determination whether this crack is the point of origin of engine failure,'' said board spokesman <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopatkiewicz </PERSON>. However, he and <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON> said preliminary evidence indicates the crack existed prior to the flight. He did not say what led investigators to that conclusion. Investigators believe the middle engine in the DC-10 disintegrated in flight, severing hydraulic lines and making the plane almost impossible to steer. The craft cartwheeled out of control as the pilots were trying to make an emergency landing. The farmer who found the engine part, <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorenson </PERSON>, Thursday received a reward check for $ 116,000 from engine builder <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and was told to expect another $ 3,225. Ms. <PERSON> Sorenson </PERSON> found the piece, about a third of it broken off, while harvesting corn Tuesday with a combine near <LOCATION> Alta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. GE had offered a $ 50,000 reward for the titanium fan disk from the rear engine of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jetliner and several thousand dollars more for other parts attached to the disk, including fan blades, which were included in her discovery. `` After nearly three months of intensive searching ... we are hopeful this engine part will lead us to the cause of the failure, so that we can ensure that an accident such as this never happens again,'' <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. He said the first examination of the engine part indicated a crack `` on the surface -LRB- that -RRB- emanates both axially fore and aft and radially toward the rim'' of the disk. This means it appears along the interior surface of the doughnut-like disk, running from the front to the back of the engine, and penetrates into the rim itself. The portion of the disk that has been recovered includes two-thirds of the fan disk itself, along with 25 of the 38 fan blade roots in the engine. A pie-shaped third of the 86.4-inch diameter disk and fan blades is still missing, <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON> said. The partial disk assembly was examined Wednesday and Thursday at the <LOCATION> Evendale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> jet engine plant. <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON> said a team including two safety board metallurgists and other government and industry investigators on the crash investigation's power plant team were examining the disk.

 Voters turned out by the thousands on Thursday to elect new high school councils, taking the first step in an ambitious experiment in grassroots control of the city's ailing school system, officials said. <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> officials said they were pleased with the two-day turnout to elect members to 71 city high school and 469 elementary school councils. An early tally of ballots show that 104,000 people voted Thursday to elect members to the 71 high school councils, said school board spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Saigh </PERSON>. `` There are some close races, but there are no major disputes,'' <PERSON> Saigh </PERSON> said late Thursday. `` It's been a terrific success in that it's been so trouble free.'' Turnout for the elementary vote was below projections made by some activists, and officials said less than 5 percent of the eligible parents had voted in the high school elections. School board officials estimate about 300,000 people voted in both high school and elementary school elections _ twice the vote turnout in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s most recent election. `` We have nothing to compare it with,'' said <PERSON> Maxey </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacchus </PERSON>, an election organizer at the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> offices. `` You know at one time we thought there would n't be contested elections. Every school had contested elections. `` That was the first benchmark, and we are absolutely pleased that people signed up in the numbers they did to vote and the numbers they did to run as candidates,'' he said. The elections were part of a reform package passed last year by the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> that also called for cutting administrative jobs and shifting money in the $ 2.26 billion school budget to target low-income students. The 17,256 candidates in the two-day election sought 5,400 unpaid positions on the 540 councils, each of which will include six parents, two teachers and two community residents without schoolchildren. School staffs will elect the teacher members. The 11th member of each council will be the principal of the school or schools the council oversees. The councils, scheduled to begin their monthly meetings within in a week of the elections, will have authority to hire and fire principals, develop school-improvement plans and spend money. <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Munoz </PERSON>, who was elected as a community representative to an elementary school, said one of the first steps of his council would be to `` build a relationship with the principal and the teachers, rather than them looking at us as the enemies.'' A tally of votes cast Wednesday showed that 175,275 people cast ballots at the system's elementary schools. Officials said 85,102 parents of school students voted in the election, with 64,863 ballots cast by community residents and 25,310 ballots cast by <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> staff members. Officials said there were a number of reports of irregularities in Wednesday's balloting, most of them caused by inexperienced election judges and ballots that had more than 20 candidates at some schools.

 <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> sees the impact of the state's faltering economy each day at his Union Market Station restaurant. He sees it in the empty seats and in the regulars who still show up. `` I have clients come in every day and talk about layoffs,'' said <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, whose 180-seat eatery offers burgers, salads and sandwiches for lunch. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>'s restaurant, built around an old railroad car, is a short ride from Route 128, where the high-tech industry that fueled a boom economy of the 1980s is running out of steam. `` I can tell you business is lousy,'' said <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, who can also see it in his family. His 24-year-old daughter, who studied to be a teacher, ca n't find a job and is living at her parents' home in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>. `` She has n't got an inkling of a job anywhere,'' <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said. That's not surprising, since school systems in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> may lay off as many as 5,000 teachers due to budget cuts. Layoffs, cutbacks and the politics of penny-pinching were once alien concepts here. But this is the new <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> _ not the miracle state Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ballyhooed during his presidential campaign. It's the state where some towns are turning off street lights to save money and others are asking kids to pay to play high school sports. This is the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> where just two years ago the economy was so strong that <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> and other merchants had to practically drag people off the street to work for them. Now, <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> fields two to three applications a day. State officials say that September's unemployment rate of 4.4 percent was higher than before but still was third lowest among the 11 largest industrial states. And 1988 per capita income was the third highest in the nation. However, the slowdown in the high-tech industry _ the result of more companies in the field and slower sales and growth _ prompts regular reports of belt-tightening, such as <ORGANIZATION> Wang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION>' recent layoff of 2,200 people And the real estate market, once one of the hottest in the country, has gone `` mushy,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Howell </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> economist. `` I would look at this as a flattening out.'' In the cycle under way, people are spending less, and the state is reaping less from sales taxes. Budget cuts are hurting, especially the poor and sick. `` There is a mean spirit out there about the poor,'' said <PERSON> Michal </PERSON> <PERSON> Regunberg </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION>. `` When times get tough, the poor become the easiest target. We are seeing that all over the state.'' <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Rock </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Pelham </LOCATION> in the western part of the state, said she already has trouble feeding two children on a welfare check of $ 178 every two weeks. `` I do n't have enough as it is. The last week of every month is a real struggle for me,'' she said. Rock has epilepsy and her doctor has advised her not to drive. Her 18-year-old son has bone disease. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, which agonized over budget deficits through most of the spring, must still cut or raise $ 500 million in a $ 12.3 billion budget this year, because revenues are falling short again. Taxes have haunted <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> since his presidential campaign. He originally supported taxes to save state programs, but a wave of anti-tax sentiment left him nothing but budget-cutting, and he's pledged to eliminate 2,300 jobs <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did manage to get through an 18-month income tax increase that would shave about $ 85 off a $ 20,000 income this year and $ 170 next year. But an anti-tax group has started a petition drive to halt that measure. The anti-tax sentiment is so widespread that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is considering endorsing a more palatable revenue-raising measure _ a bill to allow betting on professional football. Normally he `` would n't touch this with a 10-foot pole.'' But cuts in the past year, especially in aid to cities and towns, have been severe. There is little left. In <ORGANIZATION> Middlesex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, officials have asked for volunteers to help with mounting paperwork. `` We need clerk typists and stenographers and filing clerks,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, the clerk magistrate. There are four junior clerk vacancies at the county's superior courthouses in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON>. `` We ca n't fill these positions. They're frozen,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. `` This place is going to fall apart if we do n't get some funds.'' <ORGANIZATION> Essex </ORGANIZATION>, a town of 3,000 north of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, has turned off street lights to make ends meet. The town had already stopped garbage collection and its turn-of-the-century town hall may have to close because repairs are impossible as long as residents refuse to override a statewide 2 -LCB- percent property tax limit. The Town Hall bell no longer is rung for fear it may fall through the steeple. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoar </PERSON>, the town's chairman of selectmen, describes the building as `` a DC-10 with a bomb in the luggage compartment.'' What's left to cut next year? `` Nothing. We may find a few towns going bankrupt,'' <PERSON> Hoar </PERSON> said. The state's economic future is `` a mixed bag,'' said <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrara </PERSON>, commissioner for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. He pointed out that the state is still in better shape than many others. Ironically, he said, anger and fear about the state's economic future may continue to cause damage as people refrain from spending that could keep the economy moving `` There seems to be a lot of negative psychology out there,'' <PERSON> Ferrara </PERSON> said. While the state's economic future is in doubt, there's no question that a political change is coming soon. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> wo n't be running for re-election in 1990, and candidates from both parties are lining up in the starting box. In the last gubernatorial election, Republican candidates won more jokes than votes. Now, economic trouble has pumped new blood into a lifeless GOP. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, a lifelong Democrat, sees a political conversion in his future. `` I favor the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, but I would n't vote for a Democrat right now if it was my brother,'' he said.

 In <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Girzone </PERSON>'s epilogue to the New Testament, <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> peddles his 2,000-year-old carpentry skills for chicken recipes, buses tables to pay his way to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> and quips that he has n't had kosher in ages. And like the Christ who tipped over the tables of the money-changers in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Girzone </PERSON>'s latter-day <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> has radical ideas to change humanity's relationship with God. A retired Roman Catholic priest, <PERSON> Girzone </PERSON> has just published `` <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> and the Children,'' his second best-selling parable-novel about <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>'s second comings _ and goings _ in today's world. <ORGANIZATION> MacMillan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> published both books. `` This is my attempt to present the clear and simple message of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> that's been lost over the centuries,'' <PERSON> Girzone </PERSON> said in an interview at a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> retreat in <LOCATION> Schroon </LOCATION>, a town in the <LOCATION> Adirondack </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>. The chief persecutors of that simple message have been churches themselves, more intent on preserving their authority than spreading truth, <PERSON> Girzone </PERSON> said. `` I see the terrible, terrible hurt, the anguish people suffer,'' <PERSON> Girzone </PERSON> said. `` People are desperately trying to find an answer, to find a god that makes sense. I want to present them with a god that finally makes sense.'' Religions, his own included, have failed their followers, constructing artificial barriers and rituals Christ would n't have respected, <PERSON> Girzone </PERSON> said. `` Christians fighting each other in the name of Christ _ it's so hypocritical,'' he said. `` My remedy is to plop <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>, plop <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON>, right in the middle of it.'' In the first book, <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> returns to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, takes the name <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> and sets up shop as a carpenter and wood-carver. He lives simply, earning just enough to get by, and captivates people of all faiths with talk of a God who forgives people's weaknesses, who `` did not intend to make humans little gods.'' `` To be perfectly human, as God made us, should be our goal,'' <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> says. `` If we appear to be religious or pious, we've missed the point and our piety becomes a caricature and unauthentic.'' <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> clashes with the establishment. He advises a troubled priest to fight the celibacy requirement for priests, offends religious leaders by attending services at church and synagogue alike and faces a hostile panel of <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> inquisitors. <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> tells <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> leaders that churches are `` ruled by unfeeling and arrogant shepherds who hurt the flock and do irreparable damage to God's people with complete immunity. ... To threaten God's displeasure when people do not follow your rules is being a moral bully and does no service to God.'' <PERSON> Girzone </PERSON>, 58, retired from the priesthood for health reasons in 1981 after 26 years at schools and parishes in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> borough of the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diocese </LOCATION>. Too young to receive a church pension, <PERSON> Girzone </PERSON> turned to writing and lecturing. `` <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON>,'' which sold 60,000 copies under his own company's imprint, <ORGANIZATION> Richelieu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publications </ORGANIZATION>, made the Waldenbooks best-seller list in 1986, a rare achievement for a self-published book The sequel, whose first printing totaled 175,000 copies, has broken in to the Top 10 of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> best-seller list. <ORGANIZATION> Collier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Books </ORGANIZATION>, a division of <ORGANIZATION> MacMillan </ORGANIZATION>, has sold nearly 400,000 copies of `` Joshua'' since issuing a paperback edition in 1987, and sales are greater today that two years ago, said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lippman </PERSON>, president of <PERSON> MacMillan </PERSON>'s adult trade division. `` It's not some slick fad that's caught on,'' <PERSON> Lippman </PERSON> said. `` Within two or three pages, there's something about the book that really clicks with people. It shows you can have faith without thinking of yourself as part of a church.'' Much of <PERSON> Girzone </PERSON>'s vision replays Christ's story in modern terms. Instead of raising <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON> from a tomb, <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> restores a rabbi's son to life after he has broken his neck in a fall Instead of making five loaves and two fish feed a crowd after a sermon, <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> stretches two sandwiches to feed 25 children on a picnic. Instead of a last supper with his disciples, <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> is the guest at a surprise party before leaving for <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. Between healing the sick and restoring sight to the blind, <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> preaches against drugs and ocean pollution, uses TV evangelism to spread his message and buys gallon jugs of table wine from liquor stores. There are even ascension and resurrection scenes. In the first book, <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> escapes a <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> boarding house where he's been locked away after telling the pope what he's doing wrong. In the second book, <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> vanishes from his coffin after being gunned down by religious fanatics in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. Unlike <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON>, <PERSON> Girzone </PERSON> has drawn few harsh words for his ideas. Most religious leaders say they see the truth in what he preaches. The `` Joshua'' stories are told simply, in simple prose reminiscent of Christ's New Testament parables. Before `` <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON>,'' writing had been an agony for him, <PERSON> Girzone </PERSON> said. But the words for the parable came effortlessly, as if a voice whispered the words in his ear, he said. `` I ca n't help but feel God wanted something done and is using the book to accomplish it,'' he said.

 Members of the nation's major religious denominations do not believe AIDS is God's judgment on people leading immoral lives, said an author who recently completed a yearlong study of religious attitudes toward the disease. `` This was a startling discovery given the almost universal denouncement of homosexuality both as a sexual preference and a behavior pattern by American churches,'' said <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Melton </PERSON>, author of `` The Churches Speak on AIDS.'' <PERSON> Melton </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Study </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Religion </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>, said most religious groups have decided that acquired immune deficiency syndrome should be separated from the issue of homosexuality, that efforts should be made to serve AIDS victims and their families, and that the civil rights of people suffering with the disease should be protected.

 Older Presbyterians are receiving fewer gifts from their churches, but congregations are working harder to find volunteer opportunities for senior members, according to a survey. Only 41 percent of the more than 2,500 respondents from the Presbyterian Church -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION> -RRB- said their churches provide gifts to older members at special seasons of the year. In 1966, 61 percent reported their churches provided gifts to older members. But more than half, or 52 percent, of respondents said their churches worked to find volunteer opportunities for older members, up from 30 percent in 1966.

 Parents should decide one faith in which to raise children of Christian-Jewish marriages, according to the director of an outreach program for intermarried couples of the Reform Jewish movement.

<HEAD>Trooper Works To Prevent Teen Suicides</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBIN P. TEATER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> was particularly disappointed when the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> adjourned without dealing with youth suicide. The few programs that exist in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> are in mental health departments, but most young people who kill themselves are n't ill and those who contemplate suicide are reluctant to call because of the stigma, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. The state <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> trooper has reason to research the problem and to know the pain from a young person's suicide. His daughter, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON>, used his .357 - <ORGANIZATION> Magnum </ORGANIZATION> service revolver to kill herself in March She was 15. `` On going through our own grief and searching for a way to cope with our grief I discovered there was very little for suicide survivors. It was such a dark subject. There's a taboo and stigma attached to suicide. People feel shameful, guilty and ca n't talk about it.'' Yet the problem of youth suicide is on the rise. As the national rate of youth suicide increased slowly from 1960 to 1980, in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> the rate from 5.2 per million people to 12.3 per million. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, a state trooper for 23 years, decided to do something about it. At his house <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> mountains, he had an extra telephone line installed and started Parents Against Teen Suicide, a non-profit support group that has 450 paying members and is 2 years old this month. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> spends most of his off-duty hours working for <ORGANIZATION> PATS </ORGANIZATION>, gets up to 40 calls a day from troubled youths and parents and travels hundreds of miles to speak at churches and schools about youth suicide. `` This thing has grown so rapidly. My wife had to quit her job to become a full-time secretary'' for <ORGANIZATION> PATS </ORGANIZATION>, he said. `` Last year we were involved with 16 people that had the gun to their head or the knife in their hands, and we were able to intervene and stop it.'' Twelve of those were youths. A 13-year-old girl with a learning disability wrote that classmates were making fun of her. The girl's mother found her on the bathroom floor after an overdose of a pain-killer, and <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> visited the girl the next day and has provided her with counseling. In another case, a deputy sheriff called one night about a young man who held a bayonet to his own throat. The deputy wanted to know what to do. After the incident ended, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> arranged for counseling for the young man. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> helped develop a suicide intervention class that is being used mainly in western <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> high schools. He has presented a grant proposal to the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> for a suicide crisis center and hotline for western <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, and hopes the idea will spread statewide. The legislation not considered by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> before it adjourned in August would establish a <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suicide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> to coordinate state efforts in youth suicide prevention. The board also would help educate the public about the problem and provide training in the schools. `` There's a need to help classroom teachers and school personnel to be aware of the danger signs. Reducing class sizes would help the teacher to see here's a student that's in serious trouble,'' said state Rep. <PERSON> Coy </PERSON> <PERSON> Privette </PERSON>. The measure included $ 10,000 for pilot projects, but the bill lost out to a push for improved pay for teachers and state employees. If it is enacted during the session this spring, the state will join <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in having youth suicide prevention acts. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said the public does n't realize the magnitude of the problem. Each year between 1980 and 1987 an average of 130 youths _ between the ages of 15 and 24 _ committed suicide in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. Nationally, more than 6,000 young people killed themselves last year _ one every 90 minutes. There are warning signs, but most people do n't recognize them, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. `` They become hopeless, helpless, hapless. They try getting involved in several things to take away their emotional pain. ... When these things fail then suicide becomes a solution to the problem. `` One of the things that young people do a lot of times is romanticize death, but they do n't realize that it's final.'' Broken homes and relationships, problems in school, drugs and the strain of adolescence are some of the factors that lead to youth suicide, experts say. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' daughter _ tall, with dark hair and blue eyes _ was an academically gifted student at <ORGANIZATION> Tuscola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Waynesville </LOCATION> and was active in basketball and volleyball. `` She was always smiling,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. She did n't have a drug problem, but she had a turbulent relationship with her boyfriend. For more than a year, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> masked her suicidal feelings. But on a Sunday night in March 1986, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> walked into her parents' bedroom, where <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> kept his revolver by the headboard of his bed. She hid it under her blouse and, as she passed her mother, she said she was going to iron some school clothes for the next day. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> stepped outside, pulled out the gun, put it to her head and pulled the trigger. She died immediately. `` Now you can look back and see other symptoms _ an irregular pattern in her eating and her sleeping,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. `` In her last few weeks she seemed to become overburdened.'' Victims of suicide often send out signals that are cries for help, he said. `` Most suicidal people do n't really want to die. They are torn between life and death.'' This was among several poems <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON>, found after their daughter's death that revealed her anguish: `` I'm an actress on the stage Playing the role of a comedian. Laughing, singing, acting dumb. Now the show is over, The room is clearing out. The lights go off, yet I act on. I ca n't let them see me hurt. I ca n't show them the real me. I'm in pain, but they ca n't know. So I just have to keep acting.''

<TEXT>
 All right, class, there'll be a pop quiz soon on tonight's new <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> series, which is set in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>. You may be asked who says: _ `` Senator, that's a smear! _ `` Mr. Ambassador, <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION> police are reporting that the nude body of your secretary was found floating in your swimming pool.... Care to comment on that? _ `` I was a bachelor until I was 39. I had a lot of women, a lot of women. That was then, this is now. Now _ I'm married.'' _ `` Remember <LOCATION> Chappaquiddick </LOCATION>? I want the truth, not a paint job.'' _ `` I've been through your file, <PERSON> Mancuso </PERSON>. You are a dinosaur. You are a hangover in a $ 10 suit.'' If a key word in all this leads you to believe all this is in tonight's premiere of `` <ORGANIZATION> Mancuso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>,'' you need not take the test. Go read <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>. The rest of you, watch this show. It will illustrate how even a fine actor named <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Loggia </PERSON> can be sandbagged by a script that gives bad a bad name. <PERSON> Loggia </PERSON> plays <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Mancuso </PERSON>, a raspy-voiced, world-weary, 30-year <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> veteran. He is cynical but unswervingly believes in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Constitution, despite all the powerful, immoral, unethical, scheming, rotten people in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, particularly those who jog. <PERSON> Mancuso-Loggia </PERSON> was wonderful last year in <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s kinky, sentimental and pretty good `` Favorite Son'' miniseries. That's the one where the president, apparently of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, persuaded him not to retire but do his own series. An unwise move, if tonight's show is typical. Written by two of the series's producers, <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON> and `` Mancuso'' creator and executive producer <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Sohmer </PERSON>, it is of value only to classic-dialogue collectors. Told in brisk, witless fashion, it concerns a scandal brewing amid <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation hearings on a nominee for secretary of defense. The nominee _ stand back, friends and neighbors _ is a liberal. He also a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, a war hero and a heartless seducer of young women before he married at age 39. He claims to have given up seducing young women. But there are those, like everyone, who think that were he a Marine, his motto would be <PERSON> Semper </PERSON> <PERSON> Infidelis </PERSON>. As mentioned in the dialogue, the deceased of tonight's plot is one of his secretaries. She lived in the guest house of the mansion the nominee and his wife shared. `` She was a good secretary,'' he tells <PERSON> Mancuso </PERSON>. `` Yeah,'' <PERSON> Mancuso </PERSON> sneers. `` What else was she good at?'' Why is <PERSON> Mancuso </PERSON> on the case? The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has been told to `` quietly'' re-open its background investigation on the nominee for secretary of defense. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, quietly means reliable sources climb to the top of the Capitol Dome and shout, `` HEY, THE <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> HAS RE-OPENED ITS BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION INTO THE LIFE OF THE NOMINEE FOR SECRETARY OF DEFENSE!'' Despite this, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s reporters learn something's up here. Sex, murder and national-security-threat rumors blossom. So do such dramatic Old Reliables as <PERSON> Mancuso </PERSON>'s ambitious yuppie superior, a smarmy TV anchor lady, and even a shadowy figure who tries to drive over <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> and an apparently key potential witness at night. The plot twists and turns before going into the Pentagon. Near the finale, in what probably will become a weekly event, <PERSON> Mancuso </PERSON> passionately rants about his beloved <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Constitution and causes a severe attack of righteousness. <PERSON> Loggia </PERSON>'s acting is good, likewise that of <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Siebert </PERSON>, who plays his best friend, a forensics expert. But most of the other players give the impression that, on the whole, they'd rather be in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. You ca n't blame them. It is difficult to be in a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> show that is so darn realistic that early on, a key character up and says: `` Senator, I'm going to ask you a question. Is it liberal to support self-determination in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>? Is it liberal to endorse sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>? Civil rights? Tougher enviromental standards?''

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, the Socialist who has eased Westerns concerns about where he would lead <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> after his unexpected landslide victory seven years ago, is heading for what polls indicate will be an unprecedented third term in elections Oct. 29. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, a 47-year-old former labor lawyer, has since led the country into an economic boom with policies that upset some of his own Socialists, labor particularly. He also has brought <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> into the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> and reaffirmed its membership in the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. So far it has been a successful road for <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, who once had to slip into <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in the trunk of a car because his party was outlawed by the authoritarian regime of Gen. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Franco </PERSON>. According to private and government polls, the Socialists are expected to win at least 40 percent of the vote from the country's 29.5 million registered voters for their third absolute majority in the 350-seat lower house of Parliament They now hold 183 seats. Polls also indicate little on the right or left can block the <ORGANIZATION> Spanish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the official name of <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>'s party The main opposition group, the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, is in disarray, having struggled in the past two years for coherence under three different leaders. Its current leader and candidate to replace <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> is 36-year-old <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Aznar </PERSON>. He took the reins of the party less than two months before <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, on Aug. 25, issued the call for this election. The conservatives now hold 91 lower house seats and are campaigning on a platform calling for privatization of state industry, sharp cuts in public spending and lower taxes. Former Prime Minister <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is repeating his 1986 attempt to recapture the office, mainly with a call for the abolition of the 12-month obligatory military service. His party now holds 28 seats in the lower house. In 1977, two years after <PERSON> Franco </PERSON>'s death, the 58-year-old <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> formed <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s first democratically elected government in 41 years. The Socialists' response to <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> on the military service issue is that they reduced the obligatory service time to the current 12 from the 18 months that existed during his administration. The Socialists also ask how <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> plans to pay for an all-volunteer army. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Left </ORGANIZATION> coalition under <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Anguita </PERSON>, the 48-year-old Communist and former mayor of <LOCATION> Cordoba </LOCATION>, is expected to gain up to five seats more than its current seven by picking up the votes of Socialists disillusioned with the <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> government, which they perceive as having shifted towards the center-right. Their slogan, `` We Are the Alternative,'' is aimed at members of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, the country's largest and historically Socialist labor movement. The union has not called on its rank and file to vote Socialist this time, claiming that the <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> government has failed to promote an equitable distribution of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s new wealth. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s per capita gross domestic product rose from $ 4,192 in 1984 to $ 7,449 in 1987, the year after <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> joined the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> and confirmed its membership <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. Its annual growth rate of 5 percent is <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s highest. In the 1982 campaign, when <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> ran in his first successful campaign, his anti-NATO stance and populist style made Western leaders nervous. In this campaign, <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> and other Socialist leaders maintain that opposition parties have failed to come up with serious platforms and alternatives. `` Their exaggerated negativism is a reflection of their frustration,'' <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> has said. `` They would be better off if they tried to come up with alternatives that would appeal to voters.'' Another issue that has upset the opposition is <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON>, who is running for <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on the Socialist ticket in <LOCATION> Cadiz </LOCATION>. Opposition parties have compared her to <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Peron </PERSON>, who had an exceeding influential role in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> as the wife of populist dictator <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peron </PERSON>, and to <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, the wife of former President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>'s only response to those who make the comparisons is that they lack `` democratic sentiment.''

 One day on the set of `` On Golden Pond,'' <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> was standing in front of a mirror combing her hair, when she felt co-star <PERSON> Katharine </PERSON> <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON> reach over and tug at her cheek. `` How do you feel about this?'' <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON> asked, peering from behind. `` This is your box that carries your persona. What do you want this to be?'' Image is what <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON> meant. What kind of a person does a face suggest? <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> did n't have a ready answer, even though neutrality is impossible for this self-styled crusader. At age 51, she's still in training. Memoirs do n't interest her. A house in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> will have to wait _ there's too much to do. Her outlook remains shaped by possibility, and by now her public knows that it's never too late for a new <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>. `` It literally does n't occur to people, maybe even women more than men because women do n't have as many options for change, that you can become very, very different, and it's never too late and it can be very profound,'' she said in a recent interview. `` You just have to stay open to life and not allow yourself to settle in. Anything can happen. I feel fortunate that I have this characteristic of openness. `` People say, ` Have you fulfilled your dreams?' I never had any dreams. My projections of the future were maybe I'd OD at 25 and end up lonely and self-destructive. I never had dreams, I never expected anything, so everything was a surprise to me.'' Relaxed Jane: She sat on a sofa at the Regency Hotel in jeans and blue flannel shirt, occasionally resting her black booted feet on a coffee table and nibbling chocolates. She talked about open participation and activism. Something's wrong Well, let's form a committee, organize, protest. Do something! Get involved! It starts with each of us. We can change the world! No wonder a special screening in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> of her new film, `` Old Gringo,'' was a benefit for the <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> and co-star <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> were there. So were the Kennedys: <PERSON> Ethel </PERSON>, <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. Wealth, glamour, power and idealism: <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> and the <PERSON> Kennedys </PERSON>. Feasts for the tabloids. The latest? The drug bust of <PERSON> Vanessa </PERSON> <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON>, the daughter <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> had with her first husband, French filmmaker <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON>. The 21-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> student was arrested Oct. 6 with a friend, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Feegal </PERSON>, outside a reputed drug den in lower <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. At her arraignment, she pleaded innocent to obstructing governmental administration, loitering for the purpose of purchasing drugs and disorderly conduct. Patrician Jane: She was born in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in 1937, the daughter of a highly respected film actor, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>, and his wife, <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>, a descendant of Lady <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON>, a wife of King <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> VIII </PERSON>. She committed suicide in 1953 although her children were told it was a heart attack. <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> learned the truth a year later from a gossip magazine. Her brother, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>, also went into movies, leaving a testament to the 1960s with the haunting `` Easy Rider.'' <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> went to private schools on both coasts and wound up partying at <ORGANIZATION> Vassar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. Unsure of a career in acting, her confidence grew in the late'50s under the guidance of Method acting guru <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Strasberg </PERSON>. Thespian Jane: There was Broadway and <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> in the early'60s. She had great reviews in bad shows, but her career was going nowhere. She escaped to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and made <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON>'s `` La Ronde'' in 1964, a vulgarization of the 1950 classic about love and sex starring <PERSON> Simone </PERSON> <PERSON> Signoret </PERSON>. She and <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> married a year later. Sex Kitten Jane: She was dubbed `` La BB Americaine'' by the French press, a reference to <PERSON> Brigitte </PERSON> <PERSON> Bardot </PERSON>, who was once married to <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON>. Among <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>'s roles over the next three years: a woman who seduces her stepson -LRB- `` La Curee'' -RRB-, a business executive's mistress -LRB- `` Any Wednesday'' -RRB- and an erotic space maiden who takes on a sex robot and wins -LRB- `` Barbarella'' -RRB-. <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> Jane: In 1968, around the time of `` Barbarella,'' students in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> nearly toppled the government, and opposition at home to the Vietnam War overflowed. At first, she defended the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' involvement, but soon changed her mind _ completely `` I've taken many paths; I've broken all the rules,'' <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> said. `` I left <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> and went to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> at the time when I should n't have. I came back, not as an actress, but as an activist.'' Nearly 20 years later, her celebrated visit to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, when she appeared on Radio <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> and begged <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers to stop the bombings, still is n't completely forgotten. Last year, a <LOCATION> Waterbury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, vet tried to circulate bumper stickers that read, `` I'm Not Fond' a <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> Jane,'' while the actress was there filming `` Stanley and <PERSON> Iris </PERSON>'' with <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Niro </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> apologized last year on national television to veterans who may have been hurt by her actions, but her effort at reconciliation was rejected by both the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars. And her name is still invoked by conservatives in political campaigns: `` Do you want <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> running this country?'' `` I'm a good scapegoat,'' she said. `` I can be painted in to an image which causes a lot of hostility. I may not be that person but that's irrelevant.'' <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> and Jane: She divorced <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> in 1970, and met activist <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON>, a founding member of the radical Students for a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. She married him three years later, and they had a son, Troy, now 16. They separated earlier this year. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>: `` Fun With <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'' was a 1976 satire with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Segal </PERSON>. But in real life `` <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'' meant President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> and the `` enemies list,'' a collection of actors, authors and activists deemed subversive by the administration. <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> was in the elite: wiretapping, harassment of friends, a failed drug bust and agents reporting on <PERSON> Vanessa </PERSON>'s kindergarten class. `` Sometimes, I literally feel like somebody who walks through a field of gunfire and does n't get hit,'' <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> said. `` I do n't shy away from ambushes and I do n't particularly have any armor. I just go through it and the shots miss me. It's not like I'm protecting myself. I just live my life and I do n't think about it.''

 <LOCATION> NEW </LOCATION> <LOCATION> YORK </LOCATION>: `` ... about it.'' Oscar Jane: Politics and all, <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> honored <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>. In 1969, she earned an Academy Award nomination for her role as a Depression-era marathon dancer in `` They Shoot Horses, Do n't They?'' Two years later, when she won the best actress <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> as a prostitute in `` Klute,'' she gave a surprisingly subdued acceptance speech and snubbed the traditional Governors' Ball. `` I have not bought in to my celebrity,'' she said in the interview. `` I'm not a snob, I do n't just like people who are famous My friends are n't famous. I do n't live like a <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> star. `` Everybody could n't believe my father and <PERSON> Katharine </PERSON> <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON> did n't know each other _ as if <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> is this little community where everybody knows each other. Very often, father was quite reclusive.'' She won the actress trophy again in 1978 for `` Coming Home.'' There were other Oscar nominations for <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s political princess: actress in `` Julia'' -LRB- ting actress in `` On Golden Pond'' -LRB- r981 -RRB-. Capitalist Jane: In 1977, <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> and producer <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> formed <ORGANIZATION> IPC </ORGANIZATION>, an independent company that would make `` thought-provoking and commercial'' films. Two of their projects, `` On Golden Pond'' and `` Nine to Five,'' each grossed over $ 100 million. `` I have an instinct for what's happening,'' <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> said. `` I've only had one failure _ ` Rollover' was the only film that did n't work I do n't know, it's timing, timing. ` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Syndrome,' then Three Mile Island. ` Nine to Five.' The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Secretaries </ORGANIZATION> formed right after it. ` On Golden Pond,' my dad was going to die. ` Coming Home,' the first real film about vets.'' Deltoid Jane: In the late'70s, the onetime revolutionary empress became a leotard liberal with her entry into the fitness market. Today, she has nine videos on the market, and all have been in the Top 20 selling videocassettes. It began in 1979 with a fitness studio in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>. Two years later, `` <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>'s Workout Book'' was in the stores with more than a million copies in hard cover alone. The video is the biggest seller ever, earning close to $ 40 million. Did she worry that her movie career would be forgotten? `` In the very beginning I did, because when I started the workout business I was not making many movies,'' she said. `` I thought that might overtake the other. But I realized pretty quickly it was n't the case. And even if it did, I am pretty much someone who lives not according to image. I do what I want.'' Whither <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>? `` Old Gringo'' was conceived in 1980 when <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> met <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuentes </PERSON>, the celebrated Mexican author, and saw herself for the part of schoolteacher <PERSON> Harriet </PERSON> <PERSON> Winslow </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> spinster whose life is transformed during the Mexican revolution. <PERSON> Cary </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> once said that <PERSON> Ingrid </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON> was the only actress whose name alone could guarantee a film's financial backing. That's changed over the years, and <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> was an actress who helped when she and Oscar-winner <PERSON> Vanessa </PERSON> <PERSON> Redgrave </PERSON> starred in `` <PERSON> Julia </PERSON>,'' a critical and commercial success. `` There's certainly more than one woman now, but it's definitely double-tiered, there's no question. Forty years ago, it would have been unthinkable,'' <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> said. `` ` Old Gringo' went through a number of administrations and the first few just humored me. Sometimes that happens in studios. They want to keep a star happy.'' <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Lancaster </PERSON> was supposed to play the role of iconoclastic author <PERSON> Ambrose </PERSON> <PERSON> Bierce </PERSON>, but could n't get medical insurance for the strenuous location work. <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> stepped in. `` He and my father are the two male legends I have worked with,'' <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> said. `` There's a kind of combination of smoothness of craft, depth of experience, combined with the willingness to really work hard, probe deep and not take it for granted. `` You could expect that at a certain point in someone's life, but not many would be ready to still do that _ turn themselves inside out. It's very painful; it's risky. My dad did it in ` Golden Pond.' <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> did it here.'' And what's next for the ever-changing <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>? `` Stanley and Iris'' is due for release later this year. <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> is also considering an American remake of the popular Spanish comedy, `` Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown.'' And the <ORGANIZATION> Kennedys </ORGANIZATION> pop up once again. <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> has the rights to <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON>'s Pulitzer Prize-winning book on <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, `` A Bright Shining Lie,'' a recipient of the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Book Award All that money and eight years of <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> have softened <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> just a little. She's no subversive, but do n't expect a book called `` Second Thoughts.'' Neo-liberals do n't appeal to her Causes never run out. Retirement is doubtful: After more than nine lives in the public eye, she has no interest in landing gently on her feet. `` I am in the streets, in theaters, in restaurants, in grocery stores. I run in the park. I run in streets. I talk to people. I take buses. I wo n't have it any other way,'' she said. `` Could I give it up some day for life on the farm? Yeah, absolutely. But I would n't retire, I'd probably organize the neighborhood.

<HEAD>Report Says Wheat-Rye Hybrid Has Global Food Potential</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new version of an old grain is raising hopes it will prove a valuable crop in the continuing global war against hunger. The crop is triticale, a hybrid blend of wheat and rye. Although grown on several million acres worldwide, triticale is almost unknown in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where wheat is the No. 1 food grain, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says. But scientists have been ironing out some of triticale's genetic problems, and <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> economists <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercier </PERSON> say crop yields `` equal or surpass wheat'' grown under similar conditions. `` Triticale has the potential to increase world grain production because it can be grown under conditions that are inadequate to consistently grow standard high-yielding grains,'' they said. `` It is highly drought resistant and thrives in many marginally productive soils.'' Cross-pollination of adjacent fields of wheat and rye have occurred naturally for centuries, but the resulting hybrid seeds were small, sterile and generally unsuited for use. Cole and <PERSON> Mercier </PERSON>, writing in the current issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine, said modern studies of triticale began in 1876 with the cross-pollination of wheat and Scottish rye. But the result again produced sterile offspring seeds. Then, in the 1950s, Canadian researchers at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manitoba </ORGANIZATION> became interested in triticale as part of an effort to combat leaf diseases that were attacking durum wheat. `` Rye's natural defenses against such diseases contributed to triticale's development as a useful crop,'' the report said. `` Triticale's sterility problem was overcome in the 1950s, and seeds were developed for distribution, though many other difficulties remained.'' Research also progressed in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and, on a limited scale, in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. A major step occurred in the mid-1960s when the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manitoba </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maize </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wheat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Improvement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> joined forces. But it was an accident that provided the key breakthrough. In 1967, a portion of the center's test crop in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> was unintentionally pollinated by dwarf bread wheats from nearby fields. `` The resulting strain of triticale, known as armadillo, appeared to solve most of the crop's problems at once,'' the report said. `` The new crop was high yielding, short-stemmed, disease resistant and early maturing.'' Today, the center _ known as <ORGANIZATION> CIMMYT </ORGANIZATION> _ estimates triticale is grown on more than 4 million acres worldwide, although <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> output is only around 60,000 acres of both spring and winter varieties. More than two-thirds of the acreage is planted in winter varieties in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Thus, most of the current triticale output is grown in developed countries on `` fairly good'' cropland, the report said. However, agronomic studies indicate it also `` may outperform wheat and rye in marginal conditions'' found in some Third World countries dependent on food aid. `` Under neutral or favorable conditions, today's triticale is able to match or surpass most of wheat's key vitamin, mineral and protein levels, although its quality is still inconsistent,'' the report said. `` Protein levels, for example, can vary by as much as 50 percent in a single year, making the crop unreliable for certain uses.'' The report added: `` Triticale, however, can produce a crop under conditions in which many wheat varieties would die.'' Although there are drawbacks such as low test weights when grown under marginal conditions, research on new varieties is under way in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in hopes of producing triticale flour yields equal to wheat. `` Triticale flour has many baking uses,'' the report said. `` These include unleavened specialty breads and other baked goods that typically rely on soft-wheat flours, such as pastas, cakes and cookies. Triticale bread, depending on the plant variety, rises to the same level and consistency as breads made with many soft wheat strains.'' Further, it said, triticale has non-baking food uses, including breakfast cereals, and is being used in some <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> countries as a malting agent for beer. `` Triticale is still an unfamiliar crop in most places,'' the report said. `` Further, its use would require modifying farming and milling practices. Some growth, nonetheless, could occur soon. <ORGANIZATION> CIMMYT </ORGANIZATION> research has found triticale to be more adaptable to difficult conditions than wheat, particularly in drylands, tropical highlands and acid soils found in many developing countries.'' Harvest failures from weather and poor soils could be reduced if more triticale were planted, the report said. Such failures might move farmers to include more triticale. `` Over time, farmers, particularly in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, may well place greater emphasis on what is increasingly considered a reliable, high-yielding crop,'' the report said.

 <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackle </PERSON> and her husband think they're lucky. They found a reliable woman to watch their 5-year-old son for $ 85 a week, even though that required getting special permission to enroll him in a school near the care-giver's home three miles away. `` And that's good for only one year,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Jackle </PERSON>, 37, a librarian who lives in <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Darby </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. `` We're even contemplating moving, so we could be closer to where she is. The Jackles' scramble to find a trustworthy sitter for their 5-year-old is a product of the growth in two-income families among the baby-boom generation. That, in turn, has created an enormous problem for working parents nationwide: who takes care of the kids and how to pay them? `` Nowadays, it seems if you're going to need care you'd better get set up before you get pregnant,'' said <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurst </PERSON>, a licensed day-care professional who watches the Jackle boy and five other young children in her home. `` I've gotten lots of calls,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Hurst </PERSON>, 43. `` I inform them I'm full until September 1991, so I do n't even bother to take a waiting list.'' Demand for child care has grown so fast that costs have multiplied, in some cases nearly consuming the money earned from a second income. This has crimped budgets of millions of Americans and created an underground cash economy of unregulated care-givers. Historically, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women have been the family care-givers. But the nation's labor pool is becoming increasingly female. A <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> study by the <ORGANIZATION> Hudson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, an <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> research organization, says women comprise almost half the work force, compared with 38.1 percent in 1970 and 29.6 percent in 1950. Other Labor Department figures say 57 percent of all women with children under 6 work outside the home, compared with 12 percent in 1950. The Children's Defense Fund, a Washington-based child-advocacy group, predicts that by 1995, two-thirds of all preschool children will have working mothers, an increase of 50 percent in a decade. `` Only 7 percent of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> households now fit the <PERSON> Beaver </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleaver </PERSON> family's mold of breadwinning father and at-home mother,'' says a policy paper by the <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> coalition that advocates a national system of care. `` As female labor force participation rates continue to climb, the demand for child care will grow, too.'' Many companies, striving to attract or retain valued employees, offer incentives ranging from flexible work schedules to emergency sitters. Some have gone further, allowing young parents to work at home or take years off with full benefits and job guarantees. Others are building in-house day-care centers, hiring roving nannies or subsidizing the cost of care with cash. `` Certainly it's fashionable these days for corporations to get into this,'' said <PERSON> Antony </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> referral service many companies retain to help employees find sitters. `` A lot of people viscerally respond to the child-care issue,'' he said. `` Anyone who takes the kid to the family day-care provider to find a note on the door saying, ` I have the flu,' knows what it's like.'' <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, for example, this year donated space in its office building for a public kindergarten that doubles as an after-school day-care center, with priority given to children of bank employees. <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a fast-growing bank in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, plans to offer many of its workers a child-care reimbursement of up to 50 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Pitney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bowes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a leading maker of business machines in <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, helped pioneer flexible working hours to accommodate working parents, allowing them to arrive early some days, leave early on others. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, overnight delivery service, offers working parents four-day weeks and 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. shifts. Last month, seven large New York-based employers, hoping to cut absenteeism, announced a pilot program to provide emergency sitters for workers whose usual arrangements are disrupted. `` Companies are finding that if they're not family friendly, they're losing employees,'' said <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> <PERSON> Dusky </PERSON>, a free-lance writer and co-author of `` The Best Companies for Women,'' a guidebook to 50 American corporations. `` Companies are n't doing this to be altruistic. If companies do n't do something, we're in trouble.'' Child-care activists say, however, that the high-profile benefits of a few companies mask a potential labor crisis. Most businesses say child care is n't a work-related issue, despite evidence that help from the boss lowers turnover, raises morale and improves productivity. Moreover, the activists say, the federal government is n't providing much help. Although a bill that would vastly expand federal support for child care is working through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, it faces a likely White House veto because of the estimated $ 22.7 billion cost over five years. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposes more modest legislation that would cost $ 2.5 billion a year by 1993, mostly through tax credits to parents. Still, that's less than $ 20 a week or about $ 1,000 a year, and it would go only to poorer families. Actual costs for out-of-home child care range from $ 1,500 to $ 10,000 a year, according to a study by the <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, a New York-based business research group. Other studies show much higher costs for in-home care. Because of the costs and the scarcity of day-care openings, the vast majority of working parents contend with a hodge-podge, hit-or-miss system for finding help they can trust and afford. Stories abound of sitters who ignore, abandon, abuse or kidnap children. Most parents rely on referrals from friends and relatives, but the result can be hiring an unlicensed, untrained care-giver. An additional aggravation is that these care-givers generally take only cash to avoid paying income tax. An estimated $ 7 billion in day-care income goes unreported annually. Beginning this year, parents must give the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> the name and social security number of their day-care provider to qualify for a tax credit to defray child-care costs. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> plans to cross-reference the returns of sitters and prosecute cheaters. Day-care experts believe the law could make it even harder for parents to afford day care, since many providers will raise rates to compensate for taxes. `` Child-care workers are the lowest paid workers in this country. One of the ways people are able to survive is to be paid without having to declare the income,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Reisman </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION>. `` I do n't recommend people cheat on their taxes,'' she said. `` But many parents ca n't afford to pay the full cost of care.'' <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON>, director of Parent's Place, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> counseling and referral service, agrees: `` We have a system that has not caught up with rapid social change in our society, in which more women are back in the labor force and need child care. Our society has n't provided support for families.''

 Chances are growing that those young women pushing strollers in the supermarket or nudging toddlers into the playground sandbox are modern incarnations of that prim English nursemaid, the nanny. The increasing number of working <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> mothers has created a strong demand for child care. For couples who can afford it, trained nannies are a popular alternative. `` In-home child care is obviously not the cheapest way to go, but if you consider your child to be the most important factor in your life, then do n't have a <ORGANIZATION> Volvo </ORGANIZATION>, buy a Chevrolet,'' said <PERSON> Cathie </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nanny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a professional group based in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. `` Seriously, a lot of people have a Mercedes and wo n't spend more than $ 85 a week to take care of their children,'' she said. Depending on the location, nannies can earn $ 200 to $ 500 a week, plus room and board. They typically work 12-hour days, doing everything from changing diapers to buying infant formula to reading bedtime stories. `` They're not there to schlep the dog around to the vet or scrub out toilets,'' Ms. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said. `` They're there for the kids. That's probably been the hardest thing we've had to do to teach parents.'' Interest in hiring nannies has grown so rapidly that schools now train recruits in this country, mostly women in their 20s who want to make children part of their careers. Courses range from child nutrition to family relations. <PERSON> Terri </PERSON> <PERSON> Eurich </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nannies </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, says her school has graduated dozens of nannies since she founded it in 1983. Students get nearly five months of training for $ 3,500. Ms. <PERSON> Eurich </PERSON> pats her school on the back for helping advance nannying as a legitimate profession and says most of her graduates quickly find jobs. `` We're doing our best to create an appreciation of a valuable service,'' she said. `` Just because they're not typing into a word processor does n't mean they should n't be paid $ 1,200 to $ 1,500 a month.'' One recent graduate, 21-year-old <PERSON> Paige </PERSON> <PERSON> Pessarra </PERSON>, cares for the 11-month-old son of Mr. and Mrs. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Ladue </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, outside <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>; <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> is a businessman, his wife a full-time medical student. `` I decided I wanted to start with an infant and nurture him,'' said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Pessarra </PERSON>, who had read about the nanny profession in Forbes magazine. She said she works 60 hours a week, has her own bedroom and living room, and gets to use the family four-wheel-drive vehicle with mobile phone for emergencies. She declined to discuss her salary. `` Personally I'm happy with what I'm getting,'' she said. `` I get a lot of benefits and extras. I look at my job as a profession. I'm planning on staying a number of years.''

<HEAD>Leg-Lengthening Procedure Spurs Controversy Among Dwarfs</HEAD>

 <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Luna </PERSON> does n't mind that doctors broke his legs and put him in a wheelchair for 10 months. And the 14-year-old dwarf says he will let them do it again because the surgery will make him a foot taller. `` It's worth it. It's like being on stilts,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON>, who went from 3-foot-11 to 4-foot-5 during the first stage of the leg-lengthening procedure. `` I can help my mom make breakfast. I can turn on light switches. I can turn on the radio and reach the top shelf on my book case. It's real neat. Most little people have extensions in their car to reach the pedals. I wo n't have that problem.'' <PERSON> Brian </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Covina </LOCATION>, is one of four teen-age dwarfs undergoing the process, which costs $ 40,000 to $ 50,000, at <ORGANIZATION> Cedars-Sinai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. Doctors carefully broke <PERSON> Brian </PERSON>'s shin bones in November 1988, then used telescoping metal rods to help 6 inches of new bone grow in each gap. They will do the same to his thigh bones early next year, increasing <PERSON> Brian </PERSON>'s height to 4-foot-11. The procedure is drawing criticism from some members of <ORGANIZATION> Little </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, who believe dwarfs should accept their physical characteristics. They say teen-agers under 18 are too young to decide if they want the surgery, and that parents may pressure them into it. `` Most little people can do anything they want to accomplish, and their height is not a barrier,'' said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Margulies </PERSON>, the group's immediate past president. `` The fact you're short does n't mean there's anything wrong with you If you're going to do something as drastic as surgery, you have to take the position that short height is something that has to be corrected.'' <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> replied: `` If they say I do n't need to do this, it's not any of their business. I'm pleasing myself. I'm not doing this for everybody. You really want to have this operation to go through all this inconvenience.'' The procedure was developed in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> a decade ago, but modified at <ORGANIZATION> Cedars-Sinai </ORGANIZATION> to reduce pain and hospitalization. `` It does an awful lot for their self-image and outlook on life,'' said Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Rimoin </PERSON>, director of pediatrics and the hospital's medical genetics-birth defects center. `` It allows them to drive cars, reach lights and elevator buttons _ to live in society without the aid that somebody dwarfed in stature requires.'' The surgery by Drs. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Isaacson </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Oppenheim </PERSON> is done in two stages: breaking the tibias, or shin bones, and lengthening them 6 inches, then doing the same thing to the femurs, or thigh bones. The fibulas _ the lower leg bones next to the tibias _ are bowed in dwarfs, so they are straightened and trimmed a bit when the tibias are extended. Before each shin or thigh bone is broken, four screws are implanted, two on each side of the planned break. They extend at a right angle to the bone, pointing inward toward the other leg. After the bones are broken and placed in casts, hollow telescoping rods are attached to screws, parallel to the leg. A knob allows the rods to be extended one-twenty-fifth of an inch daily, until the gap between each end of the broken bone reaches 6 inches. Because the membrane sheath around each bone is left intact when the bones are broken with a small chisel and hammer, new bone grows in the proper place to fill the gap, <PERSON> Rimoin </PERSON> said. Leg-lengthening, first developed for people with legs of unequal length, involves long hospital stays in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, where patients are made to walk sooner after surgery, causing greater pain, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Cedars-Sinai </ORGANIZATION>'s patients remain in casts and a wheelchair for at least eight months: five to lengthen the bone and three for the gap to fill and heal. They spend only four or five days in the hospital after each set of bones is broken. `` These kids are in and out of the hospital quickly, and after the postoperative period of a few days, they are pain-free,'' <PERSON> Rimoin </PERSON> said. `` I call it lengthening with a smile.'' Patients receive frequent physical therapy to maintain muscle tone while their legs are being lengthened. <PERSON> Rimoin </PERSON> monitors patients for impaired blood flow or nerve damage, but so far has n't seen serious complications <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> had the screws and telescoping rods removed from his shins in June and got out of his wheelchair and onto crutches in August. When his thigh bones are broken in a few months, doctors also will cut his groin muscles to straighten his back, <PERSON> Rimoin </PERSON> said. The entire procedure lasts about two years. <PERSON> Rimoin </PERSON> said it also will be used to lengthen dwarfs' arms, although <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> does n't want that surgery. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> and others undergoing leg-lengthening at <ORGANIZATION> Cedars-Sinai </ORGANIZATION> are achondroplastic dwarfs. The inherited birth defect is the most common form of dwarfism, characterized by short limbs, a normal trunk, small hands, a large head, prominent buttocks and curvature of the spine. As he grew up, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> said, people `` would make fun. It would hurt. They'd call me shorty, stuff like that.'' He also received impolite stares, was n't allowed on amusement park rides, needed specially tailored pants and had to use stools to reach bathroom sinks or to help in the kitchen. <PERSON> Rimoin </PERSON> said the surgery is best done between ages 16 and 20, and that he approves it only for dwarfs old enough to consider the consequences carefully _ <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> made a list of pros and cons and received psychological evaluation. `` It is n't something he did on a whim,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Luna </PERSON>, a divorcee who works for a defense contractor. <PERSON> Margulies </PERSON> fears the surgery is done because doctors and parents view dwarfism as a `` defect that has to be corrected'' rather than `` a characteristic such as blue eyes or red hair.'' `` There's no way I would have said, ` <PERSON> Brian </PERSON>, do this,''' his mother said. `` He's the one who had to undergo the pain.'' `` Most little people, if they wait until they're about 20 and are fairly well-adjusted, would not want the surgery,'' <PERSON> Margulies </PERSON> said. `` Once they get through the teen-age years, which are traumatic for anybody _ especially if you're different _ the desire to have the surgery is no longer there.'' <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> is happy with his taller stature, but said, `` I'll always be a little person in my genes, and I'll have smaller hands. It is changing my physical appearance, but I'm always going to be a little person.''

 <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Leamon </PERSON> not only tolerates slip-ups in his basement laboratory, he provokes them. It's all for science: <PERSON> Leamon </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s industrial engineering department, is a pioneer in the study of slipping and falling `` No one has any idea why or how people fall,'' <PERSON> Leamon </PERSON> said. `` You know it's a slip. You do n't know why.'' <PERSON> Leamon </PERSON> slipped into the subject a couple years ago when he learned that 4,000 Americans die each year as a result of falling in places like stores, fast-food restaurants and city streets. Falls are the second-leading cause of accidental death in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, after traffic accidents. Before he can figure out how to prevent falls, however, he needs to find out what makes people slip and how they react when they do. It's not as easy as it sounds, because walking is an extremely complex activity. With a $ 300,000 federal grant, <PERSON> Leamon </PERSON> equipped his lab with three video cameras plugged into a minicomputer that records 200 times a second what people do when they slip and fall. Test subjects _ graduate students paid $ 10 an hour to be fall guys _ wear a harness connected to a revolving mechanical arm. They have reflective ping-pong balls taped to their right shoulder, elbow, wrist, hip, knee, ankle and foot. The subjects walk in circles for two hours at a time, repeatedly crossing about 15 feet of slick steel plate placed in front of the cameras. When they slip, the cameras sense where the ping-pong balls are in three-dimensional space _ in other words, how the body is moving as it falls. A `` force plate'' under the floor _ a distant cousin of a bathroom scale, but much more sophisticated _ senses how much force the subject's foot is exerting downward, sideways, forward and back. The harness and mechanical arm prevent the subjects from hitting the ground and hurting themselves, but do n't interfere with the initial stages of the fall, the period <PERSON> Leamon </PERSON> is studying. In two years, he has found some facts about slipping that surprised him. `` When people slip forward, they jerk sideways. It's a physical reaction. We do n't know if that makes life better or worse.'' He also found what he calls `` microslips.'' `` Every time you put your foot on the ground, there's a slight slip _ up to a centimeter _ but you usually ca n't perceive it. One of the things we're trying to find out is when you start to perceive it.'' The answer seems to be that when you notice a slip, you're already on a collision course with the ground, he said <PERSON> Leamon </PERSON> also wants to know how vision and carrying things affect falling, and he would like to find a surface that looks and feels slippery but is n't _ the theory being that people would walk more carefully on such a floor, which would be a grocer's and restaurateur's dream. A question that dogs him: `` When you walk across a slippery floor, you can tell. How, without falling?'' <PERSON> Leamon </PERSON> said he believes peripheral vision helps prevent slips by orienting walkers to their environment. If so, long corridors with white, unmarked walls might be disorienting and more dangerous than those with stripes or designs on the walls. `` Do you want vertical, diagonal or horizontal marks on long corridors? We do n't know.'' The research could help make hospitals, nursing homes and offices safer. Step by step, he's trying to learn, with an occasional, welcome slip.

<TEXT>
 When millions of gallons of oil blackened <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>, the whole world knew where it came from _ a jagged rip in the hull of the grounded <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION>. But when a fisherman finds his fishing grounds befouled or a beachcomber's favorite stretch of sand is soaked with oil, it's often a mystery That's where the super sleuths of oil-spill investigations come in: The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Identification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>. The laboratory, often working with dissipated evidence and few clues, has helped track down those responsible for hundreds of oil spills nationwide, from one or two gallons to hundreds of thousands. The laboratory uses sophisticated tests to identify the type of oil and pinpoint its source, a task complicated by the fact that even oils of the same weight have different chemical `` fingerprints,'' depending on where the original crude was pumped out of the ground and how it was stored. `` It's like crime-solving in which all of the pieces of evidence have to fit together,'' said <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendrick </PERSON>, the chief chemist and the only civilian in a lab that employs nine other marine-science technicians. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> was given jurisdiction for determining liability for oil spills by the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, which created a $ 6 million to $ 7 million revolving fund to cover the costs of cleanups. Additional money is collected from those found responsible for the spills. The lab opened at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Avery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> campus in 1978, moved to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in 1980, and returned to the campus in 1986. In that time, the laboratory, which has an annual budget of about $ 440,000, has helped investigate more than 3,000 oil spills and seen its case load grow each year amid heightened concern about the environment. Recent spills it investigated include the 11-million-gallon spill from the Exxon tanker in March; a 288,000-gallon spill by the Greek tanker World Prodigy off <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, on June 23; and the 306,000-gallon spill from the Uruguayan tanker Presidente off <LOCATION> Claymont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, on June 24. The lab can also help exonerate those being blamed for a spill. Two technicians who assisted in the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> investigation helped save <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> $ 97 million in cleanup costs when they found that several thousand gallons in haddock - and salmon-fishing grounds did n't come from the Exxon Valdez `` We have been very busy since the Exxon Valdez incident because everyone has become much more aware of pollution by petroleum products,'' said Cmdr. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>, 40, who has headed the laboratory for two years. Most investigations into oil spills, however, have far fewer clues than the Exxon Valdez disaster. In 1987, a 50 - to 75-gallon spill fouled the <LOCATION> Willamette </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, leaving <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officials with a slick, but no suspects A year later, the lab linked the spill to oil found near an intake valve on the underside of a tanker that was in dry dock for repairs. The tanker's owner agreed to pay for the cleanup. `` A lot of people are very surprised when they learn that the oil did come from their vessel or their facility and they immediately cooperate once they're shown the evidence,'' <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> said. `` Some other people fight it tooth and nail.'' Field investigators take 4-ounce samples from the spill, along with samples from possible sources in the area. Back at the lab, six to eight tablespoon-sized batches are tested: gas chromatography, thin-layer chromatography, fluorescence spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy and high-performance liquid spectroscopy. The combination of tests allows scientists to cross-check their results. The gas chromatograph, for example, separates the chemicals that make up the oil based on their different boiling points, which in turn helps scientists determine the oil's `` fingerprints,'' <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> said. `` We compare the intrinsic chemical traits of the spilled oil against all of the suspects to pick out the source of the spill,'' he said. Spills can consist of dozens of kinds of oil, from the lighter kerosene and jet fuels to the thick No. 6 oil used in heavy industry. Oil of the same weight can have slightly different characteristics. `` There are thousands and thousands of compounds in any particular oil sample and the makeup of the sample depends on the oil fill it came from and the conditions of formation,'' <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> said. `` Also it depends on any refinery processes that the oil has been through. Any time you mix a batch of oil with another batch of oil, it's going to change the fingerprint a little bit and that's where we can really get down to pinpointing the source of the pollution.

<HEAD>Patients Who Got Radiation Treatment For Acne Urged to Get Cancer
Checkups</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 People who had radiation therapy for acne should be checked for malignant tumors in the largest saliva gland, says a scientist who linked the treatment to the rare form of cancer. People who got an average of 12 radiation treatments for acne were five times more likely than others to develop malignant cancer of the parotid gland, said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Preston-Martin </PERSON>, an associate professor of preventive medicine at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>. The risk of cancer was eight times normal in people who got 15 or more treatments. Radiation was commonly used to treat acne during the 1930s and 1940s. `` Treatment of acne with radiation is no longer common,'' <PERSON> Preston-Martin </PERSON> said. `` But our findings suggest that persons who have received this therapy should be checked periodically for parotid gland tumors.'' She and colleagues studied 139 <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> residents with malignant parotid gland tumors and 269 with benign tumors. All were diagnosed between 1976 and 1984. Nineteen had received radiation treatment for acne. Their tumors were diagnosed as early as six years and as late as 49 years after treatment. The study found radiation's link with malignant parotid gland tumors was much stronger than with benign tumors. In another study, <PERSON> Preston-Martin </PERSON> concluded last year that excessive exposure to dental X-rays correlated with parotid gland cancers. She also identified full-mouth dental X-rays given before 1955 _ when doses were higher _ as the cause of meningioma, a tumor of the membrane covering the brain.

<HEAD>Middle-Age Fathers Feel Better Prepared For Parenthood</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OXFORD, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Men who became fathers when they are middle-aged feel better prepared for parenthood, but those who were better off financially said they were less satisfied with the experience, according to a new study. `` I think the reason is because men at the higher socioeconomic status ... have had good jobs, probably traveled and had the better things in life,'' said <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ulrich </PERSON>, a researcher who studied 210 <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> fathers. `` When they compare parenthood to those experiences, it just does n't rate as high.'' Ms. <PERSON> Ulrich </PERSON>, an associate professor of nursing at <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, chose her study subjects from among 5,000 men between ages 40 and 55 after examining birth certificates to find those who became fathers in 1986. Nearly 71 percent said they had at least one year of college, and average annual income was about $ 25,000 to $ 30,000. `` The advantages of being a father at mid-life were that they felt they were more responsible, more ready to father a child and to be an important part of the child's life,'' Ms. <PERSON> Ulrich </PERSON> said. Nearly 90 percent of the men in the study reported being as fulfilled with fatherhood as they had anticipated. The same number said they had more money to spend on a child and had reached a point in their professional lives where they could spend less time at work and more with the baby. Two factors influencing satisfaction the most were the length and strength of a marriage, she said. Fifty-two percent of the fathers were on their second marriage. Those with shorter second marriages said they were happier fathers. `` It could be that they wanted their wives _ being that new wives are usually younger _ to think that they were still young enough to be a father and enjoy it,'' she said. Disadvantages of parenthood reported by the fathers were physical exhaustion and the knowledge they might not live to see their child grow up and have children, she said. The study asked fathers to rate 17 factors associated with having a baby, including having it cry at night, not having time to spend with their wives and financial concerns. Questions on satisfaction asked how much pleasure the fathers received from such things as watching the child grow.

 A device that enhances the X-ray film used in breast exams lets hospitals convert equipment to reduce women's radiation exposure and could result in better pictures to diagnose cancer The concept of extended processing of mammographic film is not new but it has been available only in new equipment, which runs upwards of $ 10,000, said Dr. G.W. <PERSON> Eklund </PERSON>, director of radiation at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> here. <PERSON> Eklund </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Surratt </PERSON>, a radiology engineer, modified a Swedish process and applied to existing processors. Conversion kits marketed by their <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radiographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> cost $ 1,700 to $ 2,200, they said. The process involves installing a variable-speed motor to adjust the time that mammographic film spends in chemical developers, <PERSON> Surratt </PERSON> said. The kit slows down the processing speed with the push of a button. `` There's about 30,000 of these X-ray film processors out there, so it's a huge market. We've found other applications than mammography, including bone studies and tissue density pictures,'' said <PERSON> Surratt </PERSON>. They've sold about two dozen conversion kits in six months. `` Dr. <PERSON> Eklund </PERSON> has come up with a way to switch X-ray processors back and forth from processing chest film to mammographic film,'' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Haus </PERSON>, a medical physicist in the health and science division at <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` We've found that extended development processing reduces patient radiation doses by about 35 percent,'' <PERSON> Haus </PERSON> said. `` And the resulting pictures offer better resolution and more contrast, which are easier to interpret for diagnostic purposes. Those are very strong benefits.'' `` We've been most impressed by our film quality and the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> examined it and determined we've reduced our radiation dose about 38 percent,'' said <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> McPharolin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Salinas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> Radiologists in <LOCATION> Salinas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` We did n't want to buy an entire new processor so we're very happy with the conversion kits.'' <PERSON> Eklund </PERSON> said hospitals also can expect to see a 25 percent increase in the life of the tubes in their X-ray equipment. The tubes cost about $ 14,000. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> health physicist in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, confirmed the radiation dose reduction and said the extended development of mammographic film is producing dramatically improved film pictures.

<HEAD>EC Defends TV Plan Against American Complaints</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Angered by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> complaints, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> says its plan to limit <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and other foreign TV programs is `` perfectly compatible'' with international trade rules. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> said Tuesday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that measure was `` blatantly protectionist'' and vowed to file a complaint challenging the policy with an international trade agency. But a spokesman for the 12-nation trading bloc, who demanded anonymity, defended the move Wednesday as legal and said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would do better under the new plan than under the current, fragmented broadcasting system in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. European officials consider the measure `` perfectly compatible _ I repeat perfectly compatible _ with the international obligations of the community,'' he said. At issue is last week's decision by European foreign ministers to press their local television stations to reserve `` where practicable'' a majority of air time for European-made entertainment programs. The measure is part of the community's campaign to lift by the end of 1992 the many trade barriers preventing the free flow of money, people, goods and services among the dozen nations. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> strongly opposed the plan and Mrs. <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> underscored her disapproval in her statement Tuesday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` The directive is blatantly protectionist and unjustifiable, and discriminates against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and other non-EC film goods,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> promised to file a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a 97-nation forum and agreement for removing trade barriers. Reacting to her complaint, the community spokesman said foreign ministers' measure has a `` non-binding character.'' The foreign ministers agreed last week their decision would be considered a political commitment, not a legal obligation. Moreover, he said, a majority of the community nations already have some type of restrictions on broadcast content. Therefore, he said, there would be advantages to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other countries from the new plan, even if it were not `` 100 percent liberalization.'' The spokesman also said TV programs were considered services, not commercial products, and therefore were not covered by the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> rules. Even so, he said the community would be willing to hold talks with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> about the measure. The dispute has revived American concerns about the community's 1992 transformation <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> last week told a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> panel that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> may have to reassess its position if the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> moves toward local content rules in such areas as TV, computer chips, telecommunications equipment and cars. According to industry figures, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has a trade surplus of about $ 3 billion from its TV and film exports. <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is the leading buyer of such programs with about $ 700 million in annual sales. The surge in American TV programs in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, such as `` Dynasty'' and `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>,'' has prompted worries among some politicians about their impact on European culture.

<HEAD>McDonnell Douglas Drops $100 Million Prop-Fan Jet Engine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is discontinuing development of a revolutionary prop-fan jet engine because customers have shown no interest in the $ 100 million design. Instead of extending research on the innovative exposed propeller engine, the aircraft builder will focus on a new generation of fuel-efficient aircraft, the MD-90 series, which it previewed Tuesday. `` After a number of years of research, this is what the customers are telling us they want,'' said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Orlowski </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION>'s MD-90 program general manager. <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> introduced the experimental prop-fan engine in February 1988. It resembles a standard jet engine housing fitted with external blades similar to aircraft propellers, but with 16 curved blades. The novelty and designers' claims about increased fuel efficiency failed to excite customers in the airline industry, officials said. Despite projections that the engine could reduce fuel consumption by 40 percent, <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> failed to get a single order for the engine type, company vice president <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said. `` Our customers indicated they were not interested in buying it,'' <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said. The gamble to develop the prop-fan engine was based on the belief that the price of jet fuel would increase in the 1980s, but prices have held steady. The MD-90 models, which come in two sizes, are designed to be more fuel-efficient than the MD-80 models from which the new series was derived. A 114-seat version is expected to be 13 percent more fuel-efficient, and a 153-seat version will save 17 percent, company officials predicted. The company declined to say how much it planned to invest in the new planes, but industry analysts estimate the development cost at between $ 300 million and $ 400 million. The MD-90 series will be powered by a V2500 engine produced by the consortium <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aero </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engines </ORGANIZATION>. The consortium included the American manufacturer <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> and the British firm <ORGANIZATION> Rolls-Royce </ORGANIZATION>, and West German, Italian and Japanese companies. <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> would not say how many orders the company needs before it can begin production of MD-90s but it has already begun its pitch to airlines. <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> hopes to begin making deliveries as early as the fourth quarter of 1994.

<HEAD>House Panel Defeats Utility Refund Bill</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> killed a bill that could have been worth an average of $ 223 per household for customers of power, gas and telephone companies. Consumer groups and utilities had lobbied vigorously on opposing sides of the issue. The 22-13 vote Wednesday probably killed any chance the legislation would become law this year. It was opposed by all but one of the committee's 13 Republicans and by 10 Democrats. The bill, by Reps. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsui </PERSON>, D-Calif., and <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorgan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.D. </LOCATION>, was aimed at a $ 19 billion reserve that utilities collected from customers and, under current law, are obligated to refund within the next 30 years The bill could have resulted in refunds within as little as three years. The excess reserve grew out of the 1986 overhaul of federal tax law. When utilities calculate the prices customers must pay, they take into account federal taxes they expect to owe and collect them in advance. Before the 1986 tax changes, utility prices were based on the assumption they would pay the maximum corporate rate of 46 percent; the new law cut that top rate to 34 percent. A separate provision in the 1986 law _ inserted, ironically, by <PERSON> Matsui </PERSON> _ gave utilities up to 30 years to refund the excess to consumers. <PERSON> Matsui </PERSON> says now that he was misled into believing utilities would put the reserve to good use in ways that would mean lower power and phone rates in the future. `` Now, however, I do n't believe them,'' <PERSON> Matsui </PERSON> said earlier this year when he introduced the bill. `` Never before in my 11 years in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has an issue been as crystal clear as this one. It's a matter of right vs. wrong, good public policy vs. bad special interests, ethics vs. greed.'' His bill would have allowed state utility regulators to require that refunds be made within as little as three years. There was little debate before the committee killed the bill. Rep. <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Flippo </PERSON>, D-Ala., contended that if the pace of refunds is accelerated to accommodate present customers, it would boost utility prices for future customers Acceleration `` will affect the credit rating of utilities and in the end cost customers more,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Colo </LOCATION>. The bill was strenuously opposed by major utilities, but it had the backing of a variety of consumer, labor and environmental groups as well as the organization that represents state regulators. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, estimated earlier this year that a quick refund could be worth an average of $ 223 per household.

<HEAD>Congressional Panel Sets Oil Drilling Hearing in Key West</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A congressional subcommittee will travel to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> this week to begin a series of field hearings reviewing the federal government's policies on offshore oil drilling. Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on water, power and offshore energy resources, said his hearing Saturday in Key West will focus on a bill that would permanently ban offshore oil drilling in federal waters off <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and the Keys His subcommittee also will travel to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to review the effectiveness of the current offshore drilling law. `` The federal offshore drilling program has become paralyzed by political gridlock,'' said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. He blasted the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administrations for encouraging offshore drilling. He said the policies have alarmed the residents of coastal states. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has responded by passing a series of one-year moratoriums on offshore lease sales in specific areas as part of the annual Interior appropriations legislation. At first, the strategy was used just for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> leases, but in the fiscal 1990 appropriations bill, specific sites in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> also were included. The legislation affecting <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to be discussed at the Key West hearing would prohibit the <ORGANIZATION> interior </ORGANIZATION> secretary from issuing oil and gas leases on the portion of the outer continental shelf south of 26 degrees north latitude and east of 86 degrees west longitude. It also would require guidelines to be established for the buying back by the federal government of existing oil or gas leases. Witnesses are expected from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minerals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the governor's office of environmental affairs, the state legislature, local business organizations, the oil industry and environmental groups.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The federal government officially launched the world's largest private telecommunications system with a three-way, coast-to-coast conference call and electronic mail exchange on the new FTS2000 network. Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>, D-Mich., on Wednesday made the first telephone call, a discussion of day care facilities with a <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> official in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> and a <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> official in <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash </LOCATION> The brief, three-way conversation was piped into a loudspeaker in the office of <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION>'s acting administrator, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>, where a gaggle of relieved telephone and government representatives applauded the connection. <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, with a bit of fumbling with unfamiliar equipment, then transmitted and received electronic messages with the two distant callers that were displayed on a nearby television screen. <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which oversaw development of the new Federal Telecommunications System 2000 long-distance network, told the gathering the state-of-the art system was a `` daring, innovative, massive leap into the next century.'' <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> said that when FTS2000 is fully implemented it will provide a host of voice, video and high-speed data services to 1,300 federal sites nationwide in what the government says is the largest network of its kind. The voice part of the system will be fully in place by mid-1990. FTS2000 is expected to slice at least $ 200 million annually off the government's $ 400 million yearly phone bill when it is fully in place. <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> said savings should surpass $ 2 billion over the 10-year contract. `` We will exceed the $ 2 billion mark by a considerable distance,'' <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> predicted. <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>, in an interview later, said that as government use of FTS2000 increases and volume discounts kick in, `` We could see upwards of $ 1 billion a year in hard-cash savings when the system is fully operational.'' <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> said the network, which actually began operation Friday, when the first of 31 government sites were tied into FTS2000, already had carried 150,000 telephone calls. He said 17 `` minor'' problems had been reported out of the 150,000 calls _ 10 numbers were reached incorrectly and there were seven pre-programmed dialing errors. The 10-year, fixed-price contract, which <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION> awarded last December following a lengthy contract-letting process and challenges by failed bidders, could be worth as much as $ 25 billion to the two prime contractors, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T has 60 percent of the network; <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> 40 percent <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lombardi </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> vice president for federal systems, said the contract was a `` model'' for government procurement. FTS2000 will serve nearly 1.3 million federal employees and is expected to handle more than 300 million calls annually. The network utilizes digital and fiber-optic technology for integrated voice, data and video services, including voice and high-speed data transmission, electronic mail, high-speed facsimile transmission and full-motion video conferencing.

<HEAD>Treasury Secretary Warns of Inadequate Prepartions for the Future</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, campaigning anew for increased personal savings and long-term investments, warned that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is inadequately preparing for the future. Noting the high <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> standard of living and relatively low rates of inflation and unemployment, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said Wednesday that `` we must not let our pride in these accomplishments distract us from focusing on whether the <LOCATION> united </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is adquately preparing to compete over the long-term in an integrated world economy ... we are not adquately preparing for the future.'' As he has previously in recent weeks, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary called again for lower capital gains taxes and elimination of double taxation of dividends to stimulate investment, and for ways to expand tax incentives to encourage individual savings. Capital gains are the profits from the sale of investments and other assets. In remarks prepared for a speech Wedneday night to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> formation, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> called for taxation of only 70 percent of the gains _ which is what a bill approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would do for many taxpayers. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democratic leaders want to replace the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> cut with an expansion of individual retirement accounts. Noting that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has higher capital gains rate than most of its trading partners, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> contended that `` we ca n't expect to remain competitive when our tax structure provides so little incentive for new investment. He also called again for the elimination of double taxation of dividends, but conceded options here are limited by the federal budget deficit. At present, companies pay dividends to shareholders out of after-tax profits and shareholders in turn are taxed on the dividends as well. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said the administration continues to examine a range of options for expanding the individual retirement accounts as a means of encouraging Americans to increase their private saving. Americans' personal savings rate _ savings as a percentage of after-tax income _ fell to a 40-year low of 3.2 percent in 1987 and increased only slightly to 4.2 percent last year. As a result, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said, domestic sources of capital are inadequate, making <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry rely instead on more expensive foreign investment. `` So ultimately, the higher cost of capital endangers the competitive position of American companies,'' he continued. `` And if our capital costs are consistently higher than those of our competitors over a long period of time, our leadership in the international economy, and even our standard of living, will be placed in jeopardy.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In another sign of weakness in the nation's junk bond market, <ORGANIZATION> Whitehall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> has called off negotiations to buy the core financial services businesses of struggling <ORGANIZATION> Integrated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Privately held <ORGANIZATION> Whitehall </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it could not obtain financing for the planned $ 310 million transaction, citing `` worsening conditions'' in the junk market and concerns over the value of the businesses. The collapse dealt another blow to tottering Integrated, once a high-flying real estate concern that is seeking to sell key assets to pay some of its $ 1.75 billion in outstanding debt and avoid a bankruptcy court filing. `` We're trying to recapture whatever asset values are in this company and they're going to the creditors,'' Integrated Chairman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinroth </PERSON> said in an interview. `` We're not exactly trying to snarf them off for ourselves.'' <PERSON> Weinroth </PERSON>, who took a leave from the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to run Integrated, put the liquidation value of the company at about $ 1.1 billion, depending on the price it gets for the core businesses. New York-based Integrated has not paid any principle or interest to its bondholders since June, when it said it would have to default because of worsening troubles stemming from its difficulty in diversifying out of real estate and into financial services. `` If the main firm they were talking to did n't have an ability to finance, it's got to place into question any other potential deals they have,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Fendrich </PERSON>, a managing director at <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, an investment-rating firm. Integrated stock fell 12 -LCB- cents Wednesday to close at $ 1.75 in composite <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading. Integrated was trading above $ 15 a share in June shortly before it announced it could not make interest payments on nearly $ 1 billion in debt. <ORGANIZATION> Whitehall </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-based </LOCATION> partnership, had agreed in August to buy most of Integrated's core financial business. But it announced Tuesday it could not find financing for the transaction and said Wednesday it suspended negotiations because of `` serious concerns regarding the value of the core companies and the risks associated with the proposed acquisitions.'' `` These same concerns and the worsening conditions the debt financing markets made acceptable acquisition financing unavailable despite <ORGANIZATION> Whitehall </ORGANIZATION>'s willingness to provide substantial equity funding,'' <ORGANIZATION> Whitehall </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. The collapse comes amid growing unease in the nation's junk bond market, which was sent reeling last month by financial woes at retailer <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Also Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> called off a restructuring because it felt it could n't complete a planned $ 400 million junk bond offering <PERSON> Weinroth </PERSON> said Integrated was continuing negotiations with another party to try to sell the subsidiaries but did not expect them to fetch the originally hoped-for $ 450 milion. The company had said it hoped to complete a sale by Sunday. <ORGANIZATION> Whitehall </ORGANIZATION> had agreed to buy <ORGANIZATION> Integrated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Integrated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Englewood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, its principal investment products distributor; <ORGANIZATION> Integrated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asset </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>; and Financial Clearing Services. After the spinoff, Integrated's main business would be management of existing public and private limited partnerships and real estate investment trusts. <ORGANIZATION> Whitehall </ORGANIZATION> is half-owned by members of the de Gunzburg branch of the <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON> family of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, heirs to the <ORGANIZATION> Seagram </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> distilling fortune, and half-owned by the <PERSON> Moross </PERSON> family of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, which has extensive financial services interests. <ORGANIZATION> Whitehall </ORGANIZATION> has holdings in life insurance and property and casualty brokerage.

<HEAD>Two Plans Filed To Emerge From Bankruptcy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday filed two alternate plans for emerging from Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws. The first plan is similar to the proposal the Pittsburgh-based appliance maker filed in August. The exception is that the latest plan does not provide for a stock sale to raise $ 140 million in cash to pay off some creditors. Under the revised plan, those creditors would receive bonds instead of cash. <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said it will offer its second plan as a backup if the first one is rejected in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Court. The backup plan calls for the issuance of shares of common and preferred stock in the reorganized company to pay off most general creditors. Exceptions would be creditors of <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Sunbeam </ORGANIZATION> unit and a secured group of bank lenders, which will get cash, the company said. <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> has a loan commitment of $ 400 million from <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> to make those cash payments and fund continued operating expenses. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sable </PERSON>, an attorney for the unsecured creditors, said his clients will not support either plan. Court hearings on the proposed plans begin next month.

 <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said it postponed a restructuring that includes selling its 825 hotels and giving itself a new name because of the continuing upheaval in the nation's junk bond market. The hotel chain on Wednesday canceled a $ 400 million debt offering that was a prerequisite for the restructuring and said it could offer `` no assurance'' the deal would be completed.

<HEAD>Dollar Keeps Rising, Stocks Fall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar kept rising against the Japanese yen today despite central bank efforts to stop it, and the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> reacted with a selling wave that caused the second largest one-day drop this year in its key index. The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 445.02 points, or 1.26 percent, to 34,795.05. The decline was second this year only to a 489.90-point drop on June 15 to 32,913.09. Today marked the index's first closing below 35,000 since Sept. 25. Meanwhile, the dollar gained 0.70 yen from Wednesday's 143.90-yen close, ending at 144.60 yen It opened at 144.25 yen and ranged between 143.70 yen and 144.60 yen. The dollar had climbed 1.67 yen on Wednesday, the day the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> raised the nation's official discount rate by 0.5 percentage point to 3.75 percent. Higher interest rates usually tend to make a currency more attractive to investors, boosting its value. `` The hike by 0.5 percentage points was too small to have much power in the market to reverse the dollar's uptrend,'' said a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` Gaps between <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s discount rate and those of other countries with major currencies are still wide, and the dollar remains a good investment,'' he said. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s discount rate is the lowest among the Group of Seven industrial nations. It compares with 6 percent in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and 7 percent in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> also was selling dollars today in an effort to check the dollar's rise, but the amount was unknown. The central bank does not comment on its exchange market activities. `` Unless the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> eases its credit, the dollar's bullish trend will continue,'' the trader said, `` although the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would not change its policy just for the sake of stability in currency exchange. On the stock market, `` the Nikkei plunged partly because of the discount rate hike yesterday,'' said <PERSON> Masahiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Umemori </PERSON>, a stock analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. `` What hit the market most, however, was the fact that it did n't work,'' he said, noting the dollar had continued to rise <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> dealer <PERSON> Masaya </PERSON> <PERSON> Hashizume </PERSON> said investors were afraid of another discount rate hike sometime soon, believing the central bank could not sell dollars endlessly in its efforts to end the dollar's rise. Other dealers said investors sold issues in anticipation of further price declines amid uncertainties about interest rate movements. The discount rate, the fee charged for commercial bank borrowings from the central bank, in turn affects other interest rates. Trading was moderate, with first section trading estimated at 650 million shares, down from Wednesday's 750 million. Prices were lower across the board, dealers said.

 Executives at many major corporations travel separately to reduce the risk that top management would be wiped out in a fatal accident, officials said the day after three <ORGANIZATION> Trump </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> executives died in a helicopter crash. On Tuesday, three of developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s highest ranking gaming executives died when their helicopter crashed en route from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. One of the executives oversaw all casino operations in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> for <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, another headed the $ 1 billion Taj Mahal casino under construction on the <LOCATION> Boardwalk </LOCATION>, and the third was senior vice president of one of <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s operating casinos. `` In general terms, top executives would not travel on the same aircraft,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` In the interest of continuity at the highest levels of management, you limit your risk.'' Not all corporations, however, have policies about their executives traveling together, said <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goranin </PERSON>, the immediate past president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agents </ORGANIZATION>. `` Some companies do; some companies do n't. There is no set rule,'' he said, adding that concern over executive safety and travel had increased since the bombing of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> flight 103 last December. <ORGANIZATION> Trump </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Klores </PERSON> said Wednesday that <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> at one point planned to be on the helicopter that crashed in a heavily wooded area along <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Garden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parkway </LOCATION>, but changed his mind. <PERSON> Klores </PERSON> said he was unaware of any travel policy in the Trump Organization. Even those companies with such policies, however, said having executives part company at the airline terminal is difficult to enforce unless the officers themselves are concerned. A 1988 survey by <ORGANIZATION> Runzheimer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Northbrook </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, management consulting firm, found that 56 percent of 108 companies responding to a survey had policies on employee travel. Sixty-eight percent of the companies with policies include limits on executives traveling together. Those limits include air travel at 93 percent of the companies, and ground restrictions at 27 percent of the companies. Fifteen percent of the companies with limitations place restrictions on executives checking in to the same hotel. <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> <PERSON> Burris </PERSON>, executive vice president with <ORGANIZATION> Runzheimer </ORGANIZATION>, said most companies usually ca n't police their executives to make sure they adhere to travel policies. `` It is a policy that is difficult to enforce unless the travelers themselves are concerned,'' <PERSON> Burris </PERSON> said. `` You'd never know it is adhered to until the plane crashes,'' he said. Some companies' limits reach into the middle-management level. `` We restrict the number of divisional people that can travel together,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonough </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a pharmaceutical manufacturer in <LOCATION> Kalamazoo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION> `` We basically say that our most senior executives will not travel together at all.'' <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s policy also included division heads. `` It would just appear to be good judgment,'' he said. At <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T, `` our chairman does not fly with either of our first vice chairmen,'' said <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <LOCATION> Bedminster </LOCATION>, N.J.-based company. `` We do n't want more than two of our senior managers on the same flight.'' As with most other companies who discussed their policies with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's restrictions did not result from a particular incident. One company, however, declined to discuss policy for security reasons. `` Our policy is not to discuss publicly the company's travel policy,'' said <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Carr </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. `` We have executives traveling around the world every day of the week.'' And the policy goes far beyond the corporate world. Even when appearing at the same function, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> take separate planes.

<HEAD>Report: Rural Workers More Likely to be Poor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARTON REPPERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A family with a working head of the household is nearly twice as likely to be poor in rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> as in the country's metropolitan areas, says a policy research group. `` Many of the non-metro poor keep their end of society's bargain: they find employment and try to earn their way out of poverty But they are unable to do so,'' the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said in a report released Wednesday. The substantially higher poverty rates among rural working poor were found among both whites and blacks, as well as full-time and part-time workers, the report said. In 1987, the most recent year for which data was available, the overall poverty rate in families in which the household head works at least part time was 10 percent in rural areas, compared with 5.7 percent in metropolitan areas. For blacks, the rural poverty rate was 27.8 percent, compared with 15.5 percent in metropolitan areas. Among white families, the poverty rate was 8.5 percent in rural areas, compared with 4.5 percent in metropolitan areas. The 1987 poverty line defined by the federal government was an annual income of $ 11,611 for a family of four. The report said there were significantly higher poverty rates in rural areas even though `` a substantial majority of the non-metropolitan poor live in a household with at least one worker.'' About 9.1 million Americans in rural areas lived in poverty in 1987, the study said. Of those, an estimate 5.8 million lived in a household where at least one household member worked during the year. In 1987, said the report, 70.5 percent of the heads of rural poor families who were not ill, disabled or retired were people who worked for all or part of the year, with 24.3 percent working full time year-round. `` The poverty rate among workers in non-metro areas rose sharply during the back-to-back recessions of the early 1980s and decline during the ensuing economic recovery,'' the report said. `` Despite the lengthy recovery, however, poverty rates among non-metro workers are higher now than they were during the recovery of the late 1970s.'' One reason rural job growth has lagged behind job growth in metropolitan areas is that non-metro area employment is more concentrated in industries that are experiencing decline, the report said. `` In particular, non-metro unemployment is more concentrated in two areas _ resource industries -LRB- mining and agriculture -RRB- and routine manufacturing _ that have encountered substantial problems in the 1980s.'' The Washington-based Center on Budget and Policy Priorities describes itself as a non-partisan, non-profit research organization that studies government spending and the programs and policy issues that have an impact on low-income Americans.

 A <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> securities dealer and investment adviser has been barred from associating with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION> for allegedly bilking $ 1.4 million from investors in six states. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dockray </PERSON> was also fined $ 700,000 by <ORGANIZATION> NASD </ORGANIZATION>, the self-regulatory body of the securities industry, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Providence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal-Bulletin </ORGANIZATION> reported today. `` This effectively kicks him out of the business,'' said <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riccio </PERSON>, vice president and director of <ORGANIZATION> NASD </ORGANIZATION>'s district office in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` Most brokers are either members of <ORGANIZATION> NASD </ORGANIZATION> or the stock exchange, and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> honors the <ORGANIZATION> NASD </ORGANIZATION> bar.'' <ORGANIZATION> NASD </ORGANIZATION> alleges <PERSON> Dockray </PERSON> ran a fraudulent securities scheme that enticed 140 people to invest more than $ 1.4 million in a `` white board,'' an electronic bulletin board and copying machine for hotels and convention centers. The <ORGANIZATION> NASD </ORGANIZATION> disciplinary complaint charged that <PERSON> Dockray </PERSON> and his partner, <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, `` misused and or misappropriated'' the investments.

A hearing on those allegations is set for November, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON>, chief of enforcement.

According to <ORGANIZATION> NASD </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> investors accounted for $ 805,000 of the money taken, while $ 110,000 was taken from <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> investors; $ 420,000 from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>; $ 85,000 from <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>; $ 10,000 from <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and $ 5,000 from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Japan's Trade Surplus Declines Overall, Rises Against U.S.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s trade surplus with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> widened in September, although rising purchases abroad reduced <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s overall trade surplus from year-ago levels for the fifth consecutive month, the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. Total exports exceeded imports by $ 7.24 billion, down from $ 7.76 billion in September 1988. The surplus was up, however, from $ 3.44 billion in August. Although September imports from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> surged 12.3 percent from a year ago to $ 3.88 billion, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s surplus with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> rose to $ 4.78 billion from $ 4.65 billion a year earlier. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imports from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> rose 6.8 percent to $ 8.67 billion. It was the first increase in three months in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s surplus with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. On a global basis, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s exports rose 4.8 percent from September 1988 to $ 24.29 billion while imports climbed 10.6 percent to $ 17.05 billion. The import growth was down from the 15.8 percent between August 1988 and August 1989. While analysts say they do not anticipate a major export expansion soon, some cited fears that the yen's continued weakening against the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar, which makes Japanese goods cheaper abroad, could add to already firm foreign demand for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s products. The weakening yen also makes Japanese purchases abroad more expensive, but government officials have said demand in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is robust. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> registered a trade surplus of $ 2.02 billion with the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> in September, up from $ 2.01 billion a year earlier. Exports rose 4.4 percent to $ 4.08 billion, while imports increased 8.7 percent to $ 2.06 billion.

 Despite regulatory vigilance and significant government cleanup efforts that brought the Great Lakes back from an environmental crisis in the 1970s, the lakes may still pose a health threat, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Canadian experts say. Accumulations of toxic contaminants are poisoning wildlife and may reach up the food chain to the 35 million people who live in the region, according to a report, `` <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION>, Great Legacy?,'' released Wednesday at news conferences held simultaneously in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>. `` Our study concludes that the Great Lakes environment is sick, and it's no longer getting better,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runnalls </PERSON>, an associate director at the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> on Public Policy in <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, which co-authored the study. The report said the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> cleanup that began in the early 1970s has reduced the amount of human waste and toxic industrial garbage dumped into the lakes, but has not prevented continued buildups of some dangerous chemicals, including cancer-causing polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, as well as pesticides that leach into the lakes. `` Millions of people in the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> -LRB- region -RRB- are exposed to the hazardous chemicals, drink them in the contaminated water, eat them concentrated in the flesh of the fish and breathe them in the air,'' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, a nonprofit group that produced the report with the IRPP. `` We know that these continuous exposures have serious adverse effects on the wildlife of the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> region,'' <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said from <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>. `` We fear increasingly that humans, especially pregnant women and children, may be affected as well.'' <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said researchers do not know for certain what the risk is to people from the toxic contamination in the Great Lakes, but the report recommends that state health departments need to reexamine and strengthen warnings about fish consumption. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, praised the report at the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> news conference, but said his agency was not prepared to say that states' recommendations on fish consumption are out-of-date or inappropriate. State officials in the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> region provide advice on fish consumption based on <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> standards for commercial fish. They are based on findings that certain types of fish, particularly bigger and older ones, are more likely to contain dangerous contaminants than others. The four states along <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> have advised that women and children should not eat medium-sized fish and that no one should eat very large fish from the lake. <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said the report shows that `` as a society we are not moving fast enough'' to deal with pollution problems in the Great Lakes. But he disagreed with report authors who said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has not done enough to meet its obligations under the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement that it signed with <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> in 1978. The goal of zero discharge of toxic substances, set for the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> in the 1978 agreement and as yet unmet, is one of seven `` principles for action'' outlined in the report. Others include increased monitoring and research to correct `` grossly inadequate'' feedback on the environmental quality of the region, and an emphasis on prevention of pollution ahead of cleanup. The Great Lakes _ Erie, <PERSON> Huron </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> and Superior _ border eight states and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, and hold 20 percent of the world's fresh surface water

<UNK>Coca-Cola Reports 22 Percent Rise in Quarterly Income</UNK>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> reported today that the sale of its bottled water business and increased international soft drink volume helped boost its third-quarter profit 22 percent from the same period a year ago. Net income for the three-month period totaled $ 361.3 million, or $ 1.03 a share, compared with $ 295.6 million, or 81 cents a share, in the same 1988 period, the Atlanta-based soft drink company said. Net operating revenues rose 8 percent to $ 2.3 billion from $ $ 2.1 billion. For the first nine months of 1989, net income was up 19 percent to $ 966.6 million, or $ 2.73 a share, from $ 809.2 million, or $ 2.20 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 6 percent to $ 6.7 billion from $ 6.3 billion. The results included a non-recurring after-tax gain of about $ 36 million, or 10 cents per share, from the sale of the bottled water business, the company said. A much larger after-tax gain _ $ 530 million or $ 1.53 per common share _ is expected to be added to fourth-quarter earnings because of the sale of <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION>'s 53.8 million shares of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, company officials said. The <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> board approved the sale Oct. 2. Chairman <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goizueta </PERSON> said third-quarter earnings also were helped by an 8 percent increase in worldwide sales of soft drink syrups and concentrates. International syrup sales were up 14 percent, but domestic sales of syrups and concentrates was down 2 percent during the three months ended Sept. 30, he said. Case sales of soft drinks in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> were even with the previous year. The <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, which markets Minute Maid brands, reported a 25 percent increase in chilled orange juice volume and a 33 percent decline in frozen orange juice volume for the quarter. The company also reported that it completed a 40 million-share stock repurchase plan during the third quarter. The plan was initiated in 1987. The board of directors has authorized the repurchase of an additional 20 million shares through 1991, the company said.

<HEAD>Grain Futures Rise Slightly Ahead of Crop Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Most grain and soybean futures prices were slightly higher this morning on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in cautious trading in advance of the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> crop report. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> is expected to forecast larger corn and soybean crops than last month's estimates of 1.89 billion bushels of soybeans and 7.32 billion bushels of corn. The report is scheduled for release at 2 p.m. Central time. Today's slight early gains extended Wednesday's modest advance. The markets drew further support from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s latest six-to-10-day forecast, which predicts a chance for normal rainfall in the eastern Corn Belt in the latter half of next week, although the western Corn Belt is expected to remain dry. The unusually dry weather of the past three weeks has kept the Midwestern crop harvest moving at brisk pace and put pressure on the crop futures markets. In early trading, wheat futures were -RCB- cent to 1 -LCB- cents higher with December at $ 4.05 -RCB- a bushel; corn futures were \ cent lower to -RCB- cent higher with December at $ 2.35 -LCB- a bushel; oats were unchanged to -LCB- cent higher with December at $ 1.41 a bushel; and soybeans were -LCB- cent lower to 2 cents higher with November at $ 5.54 \ a bushel Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .05 cent lower to .13 cent higher with October at 73.20 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .35 cent higher with October at 83.25 cents a pound; live hogs were .40 cent lower to .28 cent higher with October at 47.90 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .17 cent lower to .25 cent higher with February at 47.95 cents a pound. Cattle and pork-belly futures advanced on Wednesday while hog futures were mixed.

 After raising millions of insects to feast on corn plants in test fields this summer, researchers are surveying the damage for genetic clues to fight the $ 400 million pests. Using the same techniques that enable law enforcement agencies to identify the `` genetic fingerprints'' of criminals, they are trying to pinpoint pest-resistant genes on corn chromosomes. The aim not only is to breed corn that resists infestation by the European corn borer, but also to use the findings to protect corn and other crops from a wide range of pests and diseases, says <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, an assistant professor of agronomy at <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` You end up with an agricultural system less dependent on chemical control of insects,'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> says. `` A more stable agricultural system.'' If scientists can map the location of genes for traits such as pest resistance, they can tackle more complex genetic traits, such as those that could increase crop yields with less reliance on chemical fertilizers, he says. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> is working in cooperation with academic and government scientists at the <ORGANIZATION> Corn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insects </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Ankeny </LOCATION>, a community between <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ames </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> is located. He has a $ 160,000 grant for a four-year genetic study. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> contributed about $ 10,000 of its $ 477,000 budget from the corn research unit this year to produce the insects, place them on tens of thousands of plants and record data, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. At laboratories in the midst of corn fields, about 3 million egg masses of 25 corn borer eggs each were produced this year and kept in <LOCATION> Mason </LOCATION> jars. The larvae were raised in a mixture of ground corn grits and later placed in plastic dispensers that released them in batches of 60. Typically, 240 larvae are placed on a corn plant, but in some cases as many as 900 of the pests are let loose on one plant. There are six to 10 plants in each of the more than 14,000 test plots in <LOCATION> Ankeny </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ames </LOCATION>. `` Nothing escapes infestation,'' says <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON>, research leader at the <LOCATION> Ankeny </LOCATION> corn insects research unit. But researchers say there is no threat that a feeding frenzy of insects will be unleashed on farmers' fields from the test plots. The larvae can not survive if they fall off the plant, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said. `` They stay where you put them. They never reach adult stage,'' he says. Adult moths do not damage corn, but lay eggs in fields that hatch and can decimate crops. The corn borer causes damage when the first generation of larvae eats corn leaves and the second generation eats the protective sheath around the stalk at the time of pollination, burrowing into the plant. The damage weakens the plants and causes them to topple before the corn can be harvested. First found in this country in 1917, the European corn borer was a seemingly unbeatable scourge. In the 1930s, entire fields were laid waste. <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON> estimates that in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> fields this past summer, where corn typically is sown 25,000 plants to an acre, there was one borer for every other plant. That's down from an average of eight a plant 40 years ago, when fields were not so thick with corn. Development of hybrid corn strains and spraying has helped reduce the devastation, but it still costs <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farmers $ 400 million a year in losses and control efforts, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> says. In <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, the leading corn producing state, the corn borer costs farmers about $ 100 million a year. This summer, in test plots near the laboratory, corn with brittle stalks and leaves that looked like they'd been raked by shotgun fire stood beside plants that would have been at home in any healthy field. Even the highly susceptible plants look good compared with pictures of the crop devastation of the 1930s. `` Compared with the old times, the entire acreage is resistant,'' <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON> says. This fall, researchers are splitting each plant by hand, measuring the tunnels produced by the insects. Scientists already have identified eight corn genes that resist leaf feeding by the first generation of larvae and seven genes that condition the corn plant to resist the second generation. While those genes are not on the same chromosome, says <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON>, scientists know which of the 10 pairs of chromosome arms are involved with those genes. The problem is, each arm contains tens of thousands of genes. Using X-ray film and small amounts of radioactivity, the scientists are looking at DNA samples from each of the plants to detect genetic differences between the corn that resists borers and is susceptible to the pests. DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is the basic building block of life. It contains the genetic code and transmits the hereditary pattern for reproduction. A technique, known as restriction fragment length polymorphism, is used to detect differences in the DNA sequence among corn plants. `` This is exactly the same technique as genetic fingerprinting. What they're trying to do with the prison population, we're trying to do with plants,'' says <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>. Once the genes are mapped, the information can be used in selection programs for the development of corn. Seed companies could use the information to develop new hybrids, a process that takes about five years. `` The first thing we hope to establish is a more precise location of the genes,'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> says. `` We'll know the location of the some of the genes next summer.''

 Market suspicion surrounding <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s $ 7 billion offer for the parent of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> is misplaced and incorrect, say some airline analysts and Trump officials. `` Everybody that I speak to says that the Street -LRB- the financial community -RRB- does n't believe it, but I think people should give -LRB- <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> -RRB- more credit,'' said <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Buttrick </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Nevertheless, <PERSON> Buttrick </PERSON> agreed with other analysts that skepticism over <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s intentions and general profit-taking combined Wednesday to drive down the price of <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> stock by $ 4.25 to close at $ 97.12 -LCB-, the lowest level since the billionaire's $ 120-per-share offer was revealed a week ago More than 2.6 million AMR shares changed hands Wednesday in composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. In midday trading today, <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> was up $ 1.75 a share at $ 98.87 -LCB- in fairly active dealings. The <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> reported today that representatives of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> billionaire <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> were willing to help <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> fend off <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>. Group officials refused to discuss the report, although <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> has been mentioned from the first as a possible `` white knight.'' The market `` may not believe it,'' <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Nusbaum </PERSON> said Wednesday, but `` he has not sold his shares, and does n't plan to. This is not a stock play.'' Officials of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth-based </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> have refused to discuss the bid for the parent of the nation's largest airline, and <PERSON> Nusbaum </PERSON> said there had been no meetings between the two sides. Until there is some visible action, industry analyst <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pizzimenti </PERSON> said the softness in <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION>'s price is likely to continue. `` I think that until you see some concrete kind of action by either party, ... the stock will continue to trade at a discount'' to <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s offer, said <PERSON> Pizzimenti </PERSON>, who works for <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. AMR, considered one of the nation's best-run carriers, has said it will consider the offer `` in due course,'' but gave no indication when it might respond. There has been speculation that AMR may seek a competing bid either from an employee-management group or a friendly buyer, that it would push <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for quick legislation to require government review of airline takeovers, or that it would restructure and pay a special dividend. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has approved a bill giving the transportation secretary authority to review takeovers, but the bill is not scheduled for debate. A similar bill has been introduced in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, but is far from being adopted. Legislative concern has centered over the use of debt to finance the recent wave of airline takeovers, fearing that maintenance might suffer while companies work to pay off debt. While <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> considers the legislation, <PERSON> Nusbaum </PERSON> said <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> has received <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> clearance to pursue the offer. Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, the government must review the antitrust implications of certain transactions involving the acquisition of $ 15 million worth of a company. Meanwhlie Wednesday, the airline's largest union said it had retained a financial consultant to advise it on any possible buyout. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Koziatek </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, said officials had had no contact with <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials, but were seeking financial advice. The union represents 33,000 ground and support workers. Earlier, the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attendants </ORGANIZATION> said its officials were meeting with advisers, and the <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> is reported to have retained an adviser. Meanwhile, one of <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION>'s large institutional stockholders said it would hold onto its stock. `` We think the risk-reward is good at this point,'' said <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Aetna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION> `` The worst case is that <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> will do something to make the stock worth more than it was selling before offer. We peg that in the low 90s. The upside we do n't think is limited to $ 120 necessarily. `` We knew that when the offer was made ... that there was going to be a bumpy road and the stock was going to fluctuate,'' he said. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Aetna </ORGANIZATION> holds a substantial amount of <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> stock, but would not be specific. Another institutional investor, the Windsor Fund, said it sold its AMR holdings recently, cashing in on the higher prices since <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s bid.

 A nine-foot-tall, male ostrich is a strange sight in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oil fields, especially when it's trying to scare interlopers and attract females, but to <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, there's gold in them there quills. `` Careful,'' he said, handing a visitor an off-white, pebbly surfaced, 3 -LCB- - pound ostrich egg the size of a human baby's head `` That's worth $ 1,500.'' If the egg is fertile, and the embryo survives its 42-day incubation, and the chick survives the critical first three months _ the odds of everything going right are about 50 percent at best _ the 2-foot-tall baby bird can command more than $ 5,000. A pair of fertile, productive adults can bring $ 30,000 to $ 50,000. <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> is manager of the Yellow Rose Ostrich Ranch south of <LOCATION> Odessa </LOCATION>, part of a business taking its first steps in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Potential profits attract ranchers all over the country, especially in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>, although the hardy birds can be raised in almost every state and even above the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Circle </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Just a few years ago, ostriches in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could be found only in zoos and in the pastures of exotic-animal collectors. Now the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commercial ostrich population is 4,000 to 8,000, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Mantzel </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worth-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ostrich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's growing, growing, growing at a phenomenal clip,'' said <PERSON> Mantzel </PERSON>, who promotes the ostrich industry with preacher zeal. About 500 ranchers belong to the organization, three-quarters of them in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Most of the rest are in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mantzel </PERSON> estimated the country's adult ostrich population will have to reach at least 75,000 before it makes economic sense to slaughter them for their hide, feathers and meat. Until then, which he estimates will be in the mid-1990s, the birds are more valuable as breeders. The hide is used to make western boots, belts, other items of clothing and luggage. The feathers are used in dusters. South Africans and Europeans eat the meat, which looks, feels and tastes like beef and is low in cholesterol and fat. Ostriches are slaughtered at 12 to 14 months, when they weigh about 300 pounds and carry about 80 pounds of meat. The hide, feathers and meat are worth $ 400 to $ 500, <PERSON> Mantzel </PERSON> said. Ostrich ranchers are getting a boost from global politics since virtually all ostrich products come from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Because of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> economic sanctions aimed at protesting <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s apartheid racial segregation system, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consumers ca n't buy ostrich hides directly from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and must buy treated skins from third countries <PERSON> Mantzel </PERSON> believes American ostriches will mean big business, and that Americans will develop an appetite for the meat just as they have developed a taste for catfish and sushi. Americans already have developed a liking for ostrich leather. Highest-grade, treated hide costs about $ 28 a square foot, said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, buyer for the <ORGANIZATION> Tony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>. The average ostrich will yield about five boots made from the best-looking skin, called full quill, <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> said. About two pairs can be made from the bird's lesser-quality hide, whose characteristic bumps are smaller and less prominent than in full-quill leather. Before a cowboy sticks his feet into a pair of ostrich-skin boots, though, the bird has to hatch and grow up. That's <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION>'s business The laying season lasts from about March to October, with hens laying an egg about every other day. After 42 days in an incubator and hatchery, the hatchling is ready, sometimes getting a little human help to peck itself out of the eggshell, which is about as thick as a nickel. A hatchling weighs about 1 -LCB- pounds and can stand up and walk almost immediately. Its gray feathers look and feel like coarse hair. Days after hatching, chicks already can run. They grow eight to 10 inches a month during their first few months. They can reproduce at about 2 to 3 years of age. Ostriches in the wild can live to be 75. Because of their speed, they have few predators. `` They can sustain 35 to 40 miles an hour for five or six miles,'' <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said, adding that lions and even cheetahs have trouble catching the birds in the wild and almost always go for something more attainable. Contrary to popular belief, they do n't stick their heads in the sand. If they're cornered or do n't feel like running, they can kick. <PERSON> Mantzel </PERSON> said the birds have been known to kick coyotes to death on the American range. A 20-acre tract of range can sustain 50 or 60 ostriches, which forage and eat pellet feed. `` I tell ranchers, ` Just set aside 1 percent of your land, two or three acres, and raise ostriches,''' <PERSON> Mantzel </PERSON> said. `` I say, ` Instead of spending a dollar and a dime to make a dollar, try something you can make a profit on.' Someday, it will be a barnyard industry like sheep, cattle and goats.''

 The Nobel Prize in physics was awarded today to two Americans and a West German whose work led to the atomic clock used as an international standard. The chemistry prize went to two Americans for the discovery of surprising properties of the genetic material RNA. The physics award was given to <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> for measurement techniques that led to the cesium atomic clock, and to <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dehmelt </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for a method to isolate single atoms and make exacting measurements of them. The Nobel Prize in chemistry is shared by <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Cech </PERSON>, 41, of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Altman </PERSON>, 50, of <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. They showed independently in the 1970s and early 1980s that RNA, then thought to be merely a genetic messenger, could rearrange itself and produce chemical reactions. Their discovery `` will probably provide a new tool for gene technology, with potential to create a new defense against viral infections,'' the Swedish <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> said. Half the physics prize will go to <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON>, 74. The other half will be shared by the German-born <PERSON> Dehmelt </PERSON>, 67, of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, 76 of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bonn </ORGANIZATION>. `` All three of them have developed exact methods of measurement, which has made it possible to conduct experiments that might force us to reconsider some basic physical laws, especially regarding time and space,'' said <PERSON> Ingvar </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindgren </PERSON>, chairman of the awarding committee. Each Nobel Prize is worth $ 469,000. Informed by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that he had won the prize, <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> said, `` Are you sure?'' In an interview, he said, `` It feels great. I'm just delighted, and I'm delighted with the people with whom I'm sharing the prize.'' <PERSON> Cech </PERSON>, reached in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, said, `` I am obviously excited about it. It was something that everyone has been telling me would happen, but I had no way of knowing when. `` My main emotion is that this is a great thing for the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> and the state of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` This is not the sort of event that happens annually in the mountains the way it does in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. That gives me a really good feeling.'' The Canadian-born <PERSON> Altman </PERSON>, reached by telephone in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, said, `` I'm very happy. I'm very grateful to all my colleagues and co-workers, teachers and family.'' <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> developed a way to study the structure of atoms by exciting them to different energy levels using two oscillating electromagnetic fields. That led to the development of the hydrogen maser, a laser-like device that excites hydrogen atoms and provided the most detailed determination of their internal structure. Another application was the cesium atomic clock, in which cesium atoms are excited to higher levels. Since 1967, the second has been defined as the time during which the cesium atom makes 9,192,631,770 oscillations. `` I was really studying the fundamental properties of atoms and nuclei, and ... it was apparent this was a very, very stable clock,'' <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> said. `` It's a very valuable application. It gets used in radio astronomy, navigation, satellite navigation, many other purposes.'' <PERSON> Dehmelt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> were recognized for the development of the ion-trap technique for separating single ions _ electrically charged atoms _ according to their weight. The two developed similar techniques independently, the Swedish <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Cech </PERSON> and <PERSON> Altman </PERSON> forced chemistry books to be rewritten when they showed independently that RNA, or ribonucleic acid, could be a catalyst, or trigger, for chemical reactions. The researchers found that RNA has the rudimentary ability to reproduce itself, suggesting that the first living things might have arisen from RNA rather than DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, the principal carrier of hereditary information in plants, animals and bacteria. When <PERSON> Altman </PERSON> discovered in 1978 that RNA was necessary for a catalytic reaction in the cell, the discovery was met with disbelief and `` he could hardly believe it himself,'' said <PERSON> Bertil </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersson </PERSON>, a member of the academy. Four years later <PERSON> Cech </PERSON> demonstrated that the RNA molecule was not only necessary to the reaction, but could trigger the reaction by itself, without associated proteins that had been thought essential. The academy said the discoveries of the two scientists may provide a method to destroy harmful RNA molecules that cause infections, such as the common cold. <PERSON> Cech </PERSON>, born in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, has been at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION> since 1983. He received his doctorate from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Altman </PERSON>, who was born in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, earned his doctorate at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION>, studied at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, and moved to <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> in 1971. <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> has been at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, since 1947. <PERSON> Dehmelt </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen, was born in <LOCATION> Goerlitz </LOCATION>, now in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, came as a student to <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> in 1952 and has been at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> since 1955. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Lorenzkirch </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. He became professor of experimental physics at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bonn </ORGANIZATION> in 1952. Americans have shared or won the chemistry prize 36 times among the 112 times it has been awarded since 1901. Last year's winners were three West Germans, <PERSON> Johann </PERSON> <PERSON> Deisenhofer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Huber </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hartmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, for their work in photosynthesis.

 The stock market drifted lower today, extending the shallow decline of the past two sessions. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 18.05 points over the last two sessions, slipped 8.20 to 2,765.16 by noontime on Wall Street. Losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 3 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 469 up, 751 down and 558 unchanged. Interest rates declined in the credit markets this morning. But analysts said stock traders had other concerns on their minds. The government is due to report Friday morning on the producer price index of finished goods for September. Adavnce estimates on Wall Street call for an increase in that measure of inflationary pressures of somewhere between 0.5 percent and 1 percent, reversing the downward trend that prevailed through the summer. `` Forthcoming reports are likely to show fairly strong readings in both producer and consumer prices,'' observed <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Lavery </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> in his latest market commentary. `` Such readings may raise concern that inflation is heating up, but we believe that such a conclusion would be unwarranted.''

 Afternoons in the little village of Golf are lulled by the soft hum of electric carts and the pleasant snap of a good tee shot. Not far beyond the back nine, however, the sounds change: trees cracking under diesel bulldozers and hammers banging out another clubhouse. These are the rhythms of golf in recent years, reflecting a dramatic surge in the sport's popularity that has spurred a boom in new golf courses and country club-style housing tracts around the nation, led by <ORGANIZATION> Sunbelt </ORGANIZATION> states such as <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, tourism groups, golf schools and clothing manufacturers are seeking a share of the $ 20 billion domestic industry. The 32-year-old community of Golf, homesteaded in lonely woodlands southwest of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> as one of the nation's first golf-oriented developments, is now surrounded by new courses and billboards promising more. `` Now they call this area <LOCATION> Golf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lane </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosher </PERSON>, manager of the 131-home village that surrounds an 18-hole course. `` It's like they ca n't build enough courses. Actually, they may fall considerably short of demand, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Golf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> says. The Jupiter, Fla.-based trade group predicts nearly 4,000 new courses may be necessary by the end of the century to accommodate the burgeoning number of players, from hackers to tournament professionals. `` That's about one every day from now on during the entire next decade,'' said spokeswoman <PERSON> Kit </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradshaw </PERSON>, who noted 320 new courses have been built since 1987 with about the same number either proposed or under construction. An estimated 23.4 million golfers are whacking golf balls at about 13,630 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> courses _ an average of about 3,700 golfers for every 18 holes _ and their ranks could reach between 30 million and 40 million by the year 2000 at present growth rates. In 1980, 15.1 million golfers played on 12,800 courses. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, which leads the nation with 932 courses, is also No. 1 in planned new golf courses with 53. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> have more than 750 courses each. The age of golf as the exclusive pastime of the rich ended in the 1960s as golfer <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> rose from a modest background in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> to become a legend in the sport, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rooney </PERSON>, a professor of geography at <ORGANIZATION> Oklahoma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and author of several books on sport and leisure. `` That's when more blue-collar and factory workers started to play,'' he said. Golf, however, ranks in the bottom half of the 20 most popular sports or activities, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Goods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> reported in September. Swimming was enjoyed by 71.1 million people, followed by exercise walking and bicycling. But the golf foundation noted nearly half the players are younger than 40 years old, with the average age 38.1, and may drop other sports as they age. Also, less than a quarter of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> golfers are women and their numbers may grow in coming years. `` Baby boomers are moving into middle age and taking up a sport that is n't so physically demanding,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorsel </PERSON>, a sports psychologist at <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION> `` I'd also like to think that they are starting to recognize the almost philosophical aspect of the game. Golf parallels life in so many ways and it may appeal to people more when they enter a more philosophical stage of their life.'' Yet it still takes cash _ and a willingness to part with it _ to hit the links. Sales of clubs and balls have jumped 53 percent since 1984 to $ 963 million last year, according to the sporting goods association. Golf apparel manufacturers sold about $ 270 million in merchandise to retailers last year, the <ORGANIZATION> Sportswear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> reported. Hefty sums may also be paid to learn to swing the costly clubs. `` Money is not the question with many of our guests. The objective is to learn the game of golf,'' said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, director of the 3-year-old Grand Cypress Academy of Golf in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>. For up to $ 3,000 for a five-day stay, students have access to a medical team, including a psychologist, optics and muscle experts and an orthopedic surgeon. On a special practice tee, a computerized video unit analyzes golf swings for flaws. The system records the student's swing then superimposes a computer graphics model of the stroke of a famous professional golfer, such as <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicklaus </PERSON> or <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>. `` It's the only one like it,'' said <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>. `` It's things like this that people are willing to pay for.'' Courses, too, are now making special efforts to attract out-of-town golfers, who spent about $ 7.8 billion last year on travel and lodging. Consortiums of courses in areas such as <LOCATION> Myrtle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Smoky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> now offer charter golf vacations. Some tours even provide putting greens at the airport. Other tours are specifically aimed at the estimated 13.6 million Japanese golfers who often pay dearly for a membership to one of that nation's 1,600 courses. In <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, a `` golf summit'' earlier this month in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> examined the growing crowds at courses from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> is scheduled to hold its first golf conference in December in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>. `` We're already seeing what happens when there are too many golfers and too few courses,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Bradshaw </PERSON>. Despite forecasts of continued growth, she warned the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> golf boom could be suffocated by the early 1990s unless more municipal courses are built. `` If it starts taking six hours to play a round because of overcrowded courses, that's when people are just going to say, ` forget it,' and put away their clubs.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> today announced a $ 2.7 billion order for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> jets in a deal that could involve 90 planes and reach $ 5.2 billion if the airline exercises all its purchase options. Northwest, in a statement from <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, said the order was a `` testament to the new ownership's and new management's commitment to the people of the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> and the growth of the company.'' The order was for six <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747-400s, the world's largst passenger jet, and 40 757-200s, a shorter-range, highly fuel efficient twin jet. In addition to those firm orders, <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> took options on four additional 747-400s and another 40 757-200s. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Longridge </PERSON>, vice president of sales at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION>, said the show of confidence in <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, which has been hit with a strike by production workers, was appreciated. `` <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> is happy with the good relationship our companies have enjoyed over the years, and we look forward to working closely with <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s new management to further strengthen those ties,'' <PERSON> Longridge </PERSON> said. The planes, to be delivered from late 1993 through 1998, will be powered by <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Whitney </LOCATION> engines. Striking <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> workers, who had heard reports of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s impending order, said the news bolstered their contention that <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> can afford a better wage and benefit offer `` It does n't change anything,'' said <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>. `` When you've got an $ 80 billion backlog ... it just underscores our position.'' Striking Machinists say five consecutive years of record orders for the world's largest aircraft manufacturer should result in employees getting a bigger chunk of the gains. The company's order backlog stretches into the late 1990s. Orders before the walkout amounted to 736 jets worth $ 38.5 billion this year. The <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> order was not the first placed during the strike by the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION>, who represent 57,800 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> workers. Approximately 43,300 of the workers are in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> and its suburbs, another 12,000 or so are in <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, 1,700 are in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, and a few hundred others are at sites in several other states. <ORGANIZATION> Cathay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> said this week it has placed orders for two <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747-400 freighters and secured options for two additional models, in a transaction valued at about $ 600 million. Last Friday company officials announced an order by <ORGANIZATION> Evergreen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> for four 747-400s and two extended-range 767-300ERs and options for a like number of the same planes worth as much as $ 1.93 billion. Four planes have been delivered since the strike began Oct. 4. No talks had been scheduled, federal mediator <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> said Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s three-year offer to the Machinists featured wage hikes of 4 percent, 3 percent and 3 percent, bonuses of 8 percent of gross pay this year and 3 percent in 1990, a cost-of-living clause to virtually match inflation, a reduction in mandatory overtime and increases in some benefits. Another 28,000 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> workers start contract talks on Monday. They are members of the company's second-largest union, the <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Roughly 95 percent of them work in the Puget Sound area, with the rest in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> and at <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> bases and other government installations in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>, general counsel. <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> predicted the talks covering engineers and technical workers would have little effect on or be much affected by the Machinists' strike. He said the two unions coordinated strategies in recent years, but this year the Machinists decided not to. The contract for engineers and technical workers _ whose work includes designing, drawing, drafting and testing _ expires Dec. 1, but the earliest they could possibly strike would be sometime in January, <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> said. They have never struck and `` nobody's interested in a strike,'' he said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> officials hoped to have a settlement in the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> strike by Dec. 1. The last walkout by the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> lasted 45 days in 1977, ending a couple weeks before the association's contract expired, but had little effect on the smaller union's negotiations, <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> SPEEA </ORGANIZATION> engineers want a 14 percent increase in the first six months, 5 percent in the second six months, followed by 4 percent in each subsequent six-month period of a three-year contract. Technical employees want 14 percent the first six months and 2 percent every six months thereafter for the rest of the contract. Both want quarterly cost-of-living adjustments and an unspecified lump sum bonus. To go on strike, <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> said, his group would first have to reject a contract by a simple majority, then approve a walkout by at least two-thirds, both on mail ballots taking at least two weeks each to conduct. A walkout would mean design and development work would grind to a halt, and a return to production with the return of the Machinists would be much slower, he said. Engineers and technical workers, bound by a no-strike clause, have been crossing the Machinists' picket lines while refusing to do work normally done by the strikers.

 In a reversal of an electronics trend, <ORGANIZATION> Philips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> on Thursdasy began shipping American-made television sets to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Philips </ORGANIZATION> plans to export 1,500 table-top sets to the land of the rising sun this year, `` with significantly increasing exports projected for the 1990s,'' the company said in a statement. <ORGANIZATION> Philips </ORGANIZATION> President and Chief Executive <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnstone </PERSON> called the shipment `` a significant first step in gaining a much-needed equilibrium in the balance of trade between the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and foreign nations, particularly <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.'' The 27-inch sets were specially designed following an intensive study of Japanese consumers. They have special colors and exterior finishes that proved appealing to Japanese buyers. `` They like complexity and features,'' said A.L. <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON>, director of international marketing, adding that simplicity in using the product also is important to the Japanese consumer. <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON> said the sets will be marketed to `` upscale Japanese consumers ... the same purchaser who buys a <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benz </ORGANIZATION> imported from <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.'' The sets will be sold as products of <ORGANIZATION> Philips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, rather than as American-made sets. But with control buttons in English, the fact that the sets are American-made will not be hidden, <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON> said. The sets were manufactured at the <ORGANIZATION> Philips </ORGANIZATION>' <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION> plant, which employs 4,800 people. In addition to these direct-view sets, <ORGANIZATION> Philips </ORGANIZATION> plans to manufacture projection TVs for export in 1990 and 1991.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union at <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> has asked the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to block the proposed employee buyout of the airlines' parent company, claiming it violates laws governing the use of retirement funds. In a three-page letter sent Wednesday to <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, the union charged that the tax benefits of the proposed $ 6.75 billion buyout `` are effectively subsidizing a substantial and excessive windfall'' to <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s management and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s pilots, the employee group spearheading the takeover effort. On Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s pilots voted overwhelmingly to commit $ 200 million from their $ 1.2 billion pension fund to buy preferred stock in an employee stock ownership plan. The banks financing the deal wanted to see such a commitment before providing financing for the takeover. A group led by the pilots and <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s management, with the participation of <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, has offered to buy the Chicago-based company for $ 300 a share in a tender offer that expires Oct. 26. The pilots are the only <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> employee group so far committed to participating in the buyout. The machinists previously declared their opposition to the plan and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s flight attendants are continuing to negotiate with <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s management on contract concessions in exchange for partial ownership of the company. The deal also is being examined by the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which has expressed concern about leveraged buy-outs and foreign stakes in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines.

<HEAD>Trade Rep Presses For Open Japanese Markets On Construction, Satellites</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials pressed <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> on Thursday to open its markets wider to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businesses, with Trade Representative <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> calling for measures to aid entry of construction companies, supercomputers and telecommunications satellites. Meanwhile, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robson </PERSON> told a private business conference that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies were becoming more competitive at home and abroad but still faced difficult trade and investment barriers in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Hills </PERSON>, in a luncheon meeting with Construction Minister <PERSON> Shozo </PERSON> <PERSON> Harada </PERSON>, asked <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to continue working to open the domestic construction market, a Construction Ministry official said. She also urged <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to increase penalties for companies caught rigging bids for construction projects, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. Last month, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government said it was seeking at least $ 35.7 million in compensation from 145 Japanese construction companies for alleged price fixing on projects at a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military base. <PERSON> Harada </PERSON> replied that bid-rigging is illegal in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and authorities have taken appropriate measures. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> bars violating firms from participation in public projects for up to nine months, the ministry official said. Mrs. <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> singled out supercomputers and telecommunications satellites in talks Thursday evening with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Taro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakayama </PERSON>, a Foreign Ministry official said. <PERSON> Nakayama </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s policy of favoring Japanese manufacture was meant to develop the nation's technology rather than as a scheme to establish a domestic industry, the official said. Mrs. <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> replied that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had no objections to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> carrying out research and development, but if that led to closing out foreign products it would be opposed, the official said. Mrs. <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> on Thursday after visiting <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Later in her four-day stay, she was to confer with Prime Minister <PERSON> Toshiki </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>, Minister of <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> and Industry <PERSON> Hikaru </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsunaga </PERSON> and other Japanese leaders. <PERSON> Robson </PERSON> and other senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for the business conference urged <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to show results soon in lifting structural market barriers or risk stronger protectionist legislation from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Such barriers are the subject of ongoing trade talks between the two sides. `` Our objective is to make significant progress in the ... discussions before next spring,'' <PERSON> Robson </PERSON> told reporters. `` We believe the risks in failing to make significant progress may be considerable.'' Increased competitiveness will do little to boost American exports to and investment in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> if markets remain closed to foreign investors, he said. <PERSON> Robson </PERSON> said accusations that American corporate management is too short-sighted, emphasizing short-term profits over longer-term planning, ignored that many businesses do plan for the future. Energetic merger and acquisition activity in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, another factor often blamed for short-term planning and instability in American businesses, does not have an entirely negative impact on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> competitiveness, <PERSON> Robson </PERSON> said. `` Many of these transactions have resulted in a new corporate strategic focus beneficial to competitiveness,'' he said. Increased spending for on-the-job training and retraining and cooperation with public sector education also are enhancing <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> competitiveness, <PERSON> Robson </PERSON> said. He said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government was taking seriously Japanese complaints, raised in the trade talks, that inadequate education, a low personal savings rate and the huge federal budget deficit, estimated at 155.1 billion <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollars in fiscal 1988, were significant contributors to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade imbalance with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The overall <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit was estimated at $ 119.8 billion last year, down from $ 171.2 billion in 1987, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> figures. It suffered a $ 52 billion deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.

 Stock prices sagged today, extending their shallow decline of the past two sessions. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 18.05 points over the last two sessions, dropped 12.09 to 2,761.27 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street. Losers outnumbered gainers by about 7 to 4 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 480 up, 859 down and 551 unchanged. Interest rates declined in the credit markets this morning. But analysts said stock traders had other concerns on their minds. The government is due to report Friday morning on the producer price index of finished goods for September. Adavnce estimates on Wall Street call for an increase in that measure of inflationary pressures of somewhere between 0.5 percent and 1 percent, reversing the downward trend that prevailed through the summer. `` Forthcoming reports are likely to show fairly strong readings in both producer and consumer prices,'' observed <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Lavery </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> in his latest market commentary. `` Such readings may raise concern that inflation is heating up, but we believe that such a conclusion would be unwarranted.''

 With floppy ears, flaccid faces and fat stomachs, the beauty of Chinese swine is in the eyes of their scientist-beholders, who see them as a key to breeding efficient `` super pigs'' of the future. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> researchers hope to unlock the secret of large litters from these porkers of the Orient, and incorporate that trait into domestic hogs. It would be an important breakthrough for scientists, who already have bred hogs that grow faster and produce leaner meat. `` Litter size has n't changed much in 30 years, but we're nowhere near the limit,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaren </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> animal scientist and member of the research team. The brown <LOCATION> Meishan </LOCATION> and Fengjing sows wean about 15 pigs, and the black Minzhu nearly that number _ about twice as many as most <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sows. Scientists will try to determine exactly why these Chinese pigs have such large litters. Then, they hope to use conventional breeding or genetic engineering to give <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pigs more offspring. They hope the result will be available to commercial producers in five to 10 years. Increasing the number of weaned pigs to 11 per sow would save <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pork producers about $ 78 million a year through lower production costs, university scientists say. For example, <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> sows now wean about eight pigs per litter. If Chinese pigs could be used to produce a new sow that could wean 11 pigs, researchers estimate pork producers' costs would drop about $ 9 a hog. `` This is not like going down to your friendly, local breeder and buying a boar,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Easter </PERSON>, an animal nutritionist and member of the research team. `` This is something new.'' The 47 Chinese pigs here are among 140 purchased from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and imported in March after more than six years of battling bureacratic obstacles. The pigs cost $ 11,000 each, including delivery, and the expense was shared by the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and the federal government. Some of the pigs are at <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> and at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> livestock research station in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>. The Chinese pigs at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> share quarters with sleek, white <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yorkshire </ORGANIZATION> hogs in the school's new, $ 2-million, state-of-the-art swine research facility that includes a solar heating system. But that is all the pigs have in common. The Yorkshires are as solid as the Chinese pigs are flabby. They thrash about and squeal loudly for food, while the Chinese pigs are quiet. `` These Chinese pigs are so docile and nonaggressive, they'll work out the pecking order -LRB- with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pigs -RRB- in a short time,'' <PERSON> McLaren </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> pigs, which grow quickly, are bred for meat production and the Yorkshires are known for heavy muscle _ big pork chops and hams. The Chinese pigs mature slowly and are too fat for domestic meat standards. Chinese pigs also are nearly blind, because the wrinkles of their faces cover their eyes. Scientists are breeding the Chinese pigs to each other to increase the number of animals to work with. The first Chinese pigs should be born here in January. Then, the Chinese will be cross-bred with <PERSON> Yorkshires </PERSON>. Scientists from 13 disciplines will study every aspect of the Chinese pigs, including what food makes them grow the fastest and leanest, and whether growth-enhancers will help. `` We're talking about turning out an animal that's the pig of the future,'' said Easter.

<HEAD>Reports Earnings Increase of 22 Percent for 3rd Qtr</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that its profits for the third quarter were up 22 percent over the same period a year ago, due mainly to the sale of its bottled water business and an increase in international soft drink volume. Net income for the three-month period was $ 361.3 million, or $ 1.03 per share, compared to $ 295.6 million, or 81 cents a share, in the 1988 quarter. Net operating revenues were up 8 percent to $ 2.3 billion for the quarter from $ $ 2.1 billion a year earlier. For the first nine months of 1989, net income increased 19 percent to $ 966.6 million, or $ 2.73 a share, from $ 809.2 million, or $ 2.20 a share, a year earlier. Revenues rose 6 percent to $ 6.7 billion from $ 6.3 billion. The figures included a non-recurring after-tax gain of about $ 36 million, or 10 cents per share, in the third quarter from the sale of the bottled water business, the company said. Another after-tax gain _ $ 530 million or $ 1.53 per common share _ is expected to be added to fourth quarter earnings because of the sale of <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION>'s 53.8 million shares of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, company officials said. The <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> board approved the sale Oct. 2. Chairman <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goizueta </PERSON> said third-quarter earnings also were helped by an 8 percent increase in worldwide sales of soft drink syrups and concentrates. International syrup sales were up 14 percent, but domestic sales of syrups and concentrates was down 2 percent during the three months ended Sept. 30, he said. Case sales of soft drinks in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> were about the same as the previous year. The <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, which markets Minute Maid brands, reported a 25 percent increase in chilled orange juice volume, but a 33 percent decline in frozen orange juice volume for the quarter. The company also said it completed a 40 million-share stock repurchase plan during the third quarter. The plan was initiated in 1987. The board of directors has authorized the repurchase of an additional 20 million shares through 1991, the company said.

<HEAD>After Alar: Greener Apples, More Varieties</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHELLE LOCKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A season without Alar has taken its toll on <ORGANIZATION> McIntosh </ORGANIZATION> apples, the crisp and tangy mainstay of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s fall crop, forcing some growers to begin the lengthy process of switching to hardier varieties. Agriculture officials say some growers are being forced out because they ca n't afford to wait the five to seven years it can take for new trees to produce. `` They ca n't just change over orchards,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON>, marketing director of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. `` I know some growers that have tossed their hands up in the air and said they're done; they're not going to continue,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, co-owner of <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Orchards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a 150-acre concern in <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>. Growers are marketing a greener McIntosh apple and trying to convert bruised fruit into apple juice, sauce and cider, said Agriculture Commissioner August Schumacher Jr.. A new trend may be the brewing of alcoholic hard cider, he said The McIntosh crop was down this year, except in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, with the yield estimated at 7.1 million bushels instead of the projected 8.3 million, according to figures from the regional apple institute. The growth-retardant Alar keeps apples on the tree longer, producing redder fruit with a longer shelf life. It voluntarily was taken off the market earlier this year after a private consumer group said eating apples treated with the chemical increased cancer risk in children. The apple industry and federal <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> disputed the report as an exaggeration of the risk, and the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has proposed new standards for use of the chemical. Alar was just one of the factors in the reduced <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> McIntosh crop and the problem of apples dropping before they could be picked was not as bad as had been expected, said <PERSON> Wesley </PERSON> <PERSON> Autio </PERSON>, assistant professor of pomology, the study of fruit-growing, at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION>. But the loss of Alar is hard on <PERSON> McIntosh </PERSON> apples because they are a tender variety, more prone to dropping. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> account for 65 percent of the national <PERSON> McIntosh </PERSON> crop, <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON> said. Overall, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> apples account for 3 percent to 5 percent of the total national crop. <PERSON> Autio </PERSON> said growers appear to be ready to plant different varieties, such as Empire, <LOCATION> Cortland </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Macoun </PERSON>, and wait out the production lag. `` I think that they've had three to four years now to come to terms with it,'' he said. <PERSON> Autio </PERSON> said he expects <PERSON> McIntosh </PERSON> eventually will account for about 40 percent of the region's crop, compared with the current 55 percent. Elsewhere in the nation, apples appear to be bearing up without Alar, said <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON> <PERSON> Miklavic </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> based in <LOCATION> McLean </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Red </PERSON> <PERSON> Stayman </PERSON>, grown in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, and Winesap apples, grown in the western states, are cracking without Alar. `` Beyond that we really do n't see any other difficulties,'' she said. <PERSON> Schumacher </PERSON> said growers are hoping for higher prices in November to offset losses. He said he's optimistic the McIntosh wo n't fade away. `` It's a great apple and we hope that farmers will continue to grow it, but cultural practices may have to change, and some farmers may want to put in other varieties,'' <PERSON> Schumacher </PERSON> said.

 Stock prices lost ground today, extending their shallow decline of the past two sessions. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 18.05 points over the last two sessions, dropped 10.04 to 2,763.32 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street. Losers outnumbered gainers by nearly 9 to 5 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 500 up, 891 down and 530 unchanged. Interest rates declined in the credit markets today. But analysts said stock traders had other concerns on their minds. The government is due to report Friday morning on the producer price index of finished goods for September. Advance estimates on Wall Sreet call for an increase in that measure of inflationary pressures of somewhere between 0.5 percent and 1 percent, reversing the downward trend that prevailed through the summer. `` Forthcoming reports are likely to show fairly strong readings in both producer and consumer prices,'' observed <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Lavery </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> in his latest market commentary. `` Such readings may raise concern that inflation is heating up, but we believe that such a conclusion would be unwarranted.''

<HEAD>Pepsi Soft Drinks to be Sold in India Next Year</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> PepsiCo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the soft drink, restaurant and snack foods giant, will sell its cola and other beverages in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> next year, the company said Thursday. The announcement was released after <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> Governor <PERSON> Sidharth </PERSON> <PERSON> Shankar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> presided over the placement of the cornerstone for a food and vegetable processing plant, partly owned by <ORGANIZATION> PepsiCo </ORGANIZATION>, at this remote village. The plant is the second unit of <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> that was formed as a joint venture of <ORGANIZATION> PepsiCo </ORGANIZATION> and two Indian companies _ the <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> government's <ORGANIZATION> Agro-Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and the privately owned <ORGANIZATION> Tata </ORGANIZATION> group. The other unit, also located in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> at the <LOCATION> Channo </LOCATION> village, will manufacture concentrate for soft drinks which will be distributed to independent bottlers throughout the country. The compnay said it expects its beverage and food products will be on the market by the summer of 1990. It said the cola will be sold under the brand name Pepsi Era. <ORGANIZATION> PepsiCo </ORGANIZATION>'s share in the $ 15 million project is 39.9 percent, in line with an Indian law which restricts the holding of foreign partners in a joint venture to 40 percent. The law also forbids use of foreign brand names. According to the government's terms, soft-drink production will be restricted to 25 percent of the project's sales and exports of food products will have to be five times the value of imports. Indians were cut off from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soft drinks after <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> ended 27 years of business here in 1977 when the government insisted that the company disclose its secret formula. <ORGANIZATION> PepsiCo </ORGANIZATION> left <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> in the 1950s because of poor sales.

 Plant pathologists have discovered a previously unknown virus in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s tomato crop but say they do n't have enough information about it to predict the impact on the state's vegetable industry. `` It's a new virus for most of us,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Agrios </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION>'s department of plant technology. `` Since we really need to study the virus ... we have no recommendation on what to do about it.'' Tomatoes comprise about one-third of all vegetables grown in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Last year growers shipped to market 64.87 million 25-pound cartons valued at more than $ 600 million. With an estimated 54,000 acres planted in tomatoes, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> produces much of the winter domestic crop sold November through May. With no way now to defend against the still-unnamed virus, researchers plan simply to learn what they can about its behavior. Researchers said the suspected virus is similar to one that has stunted plant grown and reduced the quantity of tomatoes produced in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Symptons include green and gold mottled leaves, leaf curl and stunting.

<TEXT>
 Continued weakness in the market for high-yield `` junk'' bonds is casting doubt on prospects for $ 11 billion worth of new securities companies plan to issue by year end, market players said Thursday. Hotel giant <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday postponed indefinitely a $ 400 million bond issue and traders expect more cancellations in a market wracked since retailer <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> had to get a $ 250 million loan to meet its junk bond obligations in September. `` The junk bond market has not collapsed but it's done a pretty good impression of it in the last month,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Fendrich </PERSON>, a managing director at <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Prices of the high-yield debt securities, which frequently are used to raise money for small - or medium-sized businesses with slim credit histories, dropped again on Issues were down on average about 1 point, or $ 10 for every $ 1,000 in face amount. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s index of prices of 24 high-yield bond funds is down 3.3 percent in net asset value since Sept. 12, shortly before <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s financial problems sent the junk market into a tailspin. In the same period, the stock market rose 2.2 percent, based on the <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> index of 5,000 stocks, and longer-term <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds gained about 0.4 percent. A sustained decline in junk bonds _ which offer high yields to investors to compensate for companies' poor credit ratings _ could discourage use of the high-cost debt. That could crimp companies' plans for junk-financed expansions, acquisitions or restructurings Traders said the junk bond market's weakness has extended in recent days to include securities of some companies normally seen as stable. Bond prices of <ORGANIZATION> Duracell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> lost about 1 -RCB- points Wednesday and Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> Harcourt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jovanovich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> bonds have declined four points this week as investors were discouraged by a lower-than-expected sale price for its Sea World theme parks. Supermarkets <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns <ORGANIZATION> Pathmark </ORGANIZATION> grocery stores, also has been under selling pressure in recent days `` for apparently no reason,'' said a trader at a major firm who asked not to be named. `` These bonds objectively should not be that cheap,'' the trader said. `` I think it's a marketplace where people are nervous and they would rather have a small loss today than a nasty surprise a year from now.'' Meantime, a total of about $ 11 billion in new offerings from companies including <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Blockbuster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> railroad, are scheduled to occur by the end of the year. Traders expect some of the issues to be hard sells and others to be delayed, like the Ramada offering, or canceled outright, like a $ 475 million offering by <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mattress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> was last month. `` People are being very selective because they can afford to be selective,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, a high-yield bond trader at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` There's a lot more paper coming out right now. You'll probably see several more postponements or cancellations.'' <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the leader in junk bond underwriting, estimates that only $ 6 billion to $ 7 billion of the planned offerings will be completed. But the firm also said $ 11 billion in existing bonds will leave the market because of redemptions, refinancings and other bond buyback programs, which should help boost the market for the new issues.

 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has formed a holding company to dull the potential tax sting of its pending acquisition of the <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> financial concern, the automaker said Thursday. The value of the move ca n't be determined precisely, but an analyst says it may be worth millions to the nation's most profitable automaker. The creation of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and the sale of 25 percent of it for $ 800 million to institutional investors should deflect some of the taxes related to <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s acquisition of the <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> finance company, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> officials said. In a complicated procedure involving seldom-used provisions of the 1986 tax law and foreign tax credits, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> is avoiding the potential taxes by owning less than 80 percent of the holding company, compared with owning it outright. `` The net effect for us is that unless we form <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> or a similar company, the effective tax <ORGANIZATION> bill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> earnings would go up,'' said assistant <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> treasurer <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Macdonald </PERSON>. Neither he nor <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, would estimate how much savings may be realized. `` It could be literally millions,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bee </PERSON>, national director for international tax issues at the <ORGANIZATION> Seidman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> accounting firm in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The spectre of losing millions of dollars in potential tax revenues may kick <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> into action, he added. `` I think <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will look again at this area, because there are probably so many dollars involved,'' Bee said. He said there has been talk for months about the procedure <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> is using, but as far as he knows no large corporation has tried it so far. `` If a lot of companies did this, there's no way we can balance our books,'' he said. The holding company would include <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Road </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Leasing, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leasing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in addition to Associates. It would not include <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationwide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, two of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s largest financial subsidiaries. The stock sale should be completed by the end of the month, the same time <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s acquisition of Associates from <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is expected to be completed, <PERSON> Macdonald </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` The cash we are raising -LRB- through the sale -RRB- will be paid to <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> as part of the Associates acquisition,'' <PERSON> Mcdonald </PERSON> said. The Associates, founded in 1918 and acquired by <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> 21 years ago, is the nation's third-largest independent finance company. It has assets close to $ 14 billion. It was <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s largest financial acquisition. The company took over the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationwide </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 and doubled its size last year through the takeover of a number of savings and loan institutions. Those acquisitions made <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationwide </ORGANIZATION> the second-largest savings and loan association at the end of 1988, the latest figures available. The largest is Home Savings of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, held by <ORGANIZATION> H.F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahmason </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co..

<HEAD>Heating Oil Prices Rally, Most Other Energy Futures Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Wholesale home heating oil prices rallied Thursday amid speculation about temporary tightness in supplies. Crude oil futures prices also posted gains while gasoline futures finished mixed. The contract for November delivery of No. 2 heating oil surged 1.36 cents to 61.17 cents a gallon on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> after rising 0.17 cent the previous session Other contract months also rose. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Steel </PERSON>, an energy analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said reports of disruptions in heating oil shipments from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> caused some speculative buying on world markets. A low water level on the <LOCATION> Rhine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> was said to be delaying barge travel. The heating oil market also has been pumped up by a belief that supplies in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> could be tight because earlier this year an abundance of gasoline was processed, at the expense of heating oil. Domestically, industry figures on oil inventories encouraged some bullish sentiment toward heating oil, said Steel. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>'s weekly report was released after the market closed Wednesday. The November contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, rose 22 cents to settle at $ 20.47 per 42-gallon barrel after rising 8 cents on Wednesday. Contracts calling for delivery December through February sported gains also. Among refined petroleum products traded on the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Merc </LOCATION>, the November contract for wholesale unleaded gasoine fell 0.16 cent to 55.57 cents a gallon, but contracts for later delivery settled with moderate increases.

 Assets of the nation's 470 money market mutual funds rose $ 899.9 million in the latest week to a new all-time record of $ 349.89 billion, the <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. The rise in the seven-day period ended Wednesday followed a revised $ 378.2 million decline in fund assets the previous week to $ 348.99 billion, which snapped a 12-week string of record growth. The decline originally was reported as $ 429.3 million to $ 348.94 billion. The previous all-time high of $ 349.37 billion reported by the Washington-based mutual fund trade group was established in the week ended Sept. 27.

The 30-day average yield rose to 8.27 percent from 8.26 percent, <PERSON> Donoghue </PERSON>'s said. The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was 38 days, unchanged. The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual yield available on money market accounts at 6.42 percent as of Wednesday, unchanged.

 Stock prices lost ground for the third straight session Thursday as traders warily awaited the latest government data on inflation. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 13.52 to 2,759.84, bringing its loss over the last three trading days to 31.57 points. The average hit a record closing high of 2,791.41 on Monday. Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 5 to 3 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 543 up, 907 down and 511 unchanged. Interest rates dropped in the credit markets. But analysts said stock traders had other concerns on their minds. The government is due to report Friday morning on the producer price index of finished goods for September. Advance estimates on Wall Street call for an increase in that measure of inflationary pressures of somewhere between 0.5 percent and 1 percent, reversing the downward trend that prevailed through the summer. `` Forthcoming reports are likely to show fairly strong readings in both producer and consumer prices,'' observed <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Lavery </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> in his latest market commentary. `` Such readings may raise concern that inflation is heating up, but we believe that such a conclusion would be unwarranted.'' Losers among the blue chips included <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION>, down -LCB- at 52; <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION>, down | at 44 -RRB-; <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION>, down 1 ~ at 129 -LCB-; <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>, down | at 47, and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>, down -LRB- at 58 GE reported third-quarter earnings of $ 1.04 a share, up from 90 cents in the like period a year ago. <ORGANIZATION> Owens-Corning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fiberglas </ORGANIZATION> recorded one of the day's biggest percentage losses, falling 2 ~ to 30 -RCB- The company said its operating income for the third quarter would fall short of both analysts' estimates and comparable levels from the period last year. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> lost | to 24. The company estimated its third-quarter results at around the breakeven point, not counting an extraordinary gain from the sale of part of its stake in <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Raytheon </ORGANIZATION> dropped | to 83 -LCB- despite the company's report of higher third-quarter profits. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 160.12 million shares, against 164.07 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 188.04 million shares. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market lost $ 12.51 billion, or 0.36 percent, in value. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks dropped .83 to 196.98. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's industrial index fell 2.00 to 405.40, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index was down 1.60 at 355.39.

 The dollar fell in subdued dealings Thursday as traders awaited the release of fresh economic data. Gold prices rose worldwide. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold bullion for current delivery closed at $ 363.40 a troy ounce, up $ 1.40 from Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a late bid for gold at $ 363 an ounce, $ 1.50 higher than Wednesday's late bid. Many traders stayed on the sidelines while awaiting the government's release Friday of retail sales and producer prices data for September. `` If the Producer Price Index comes in on the high side, the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- wo n't have room to ease -LRB- interest rates -RRB- any further,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrissey </PERSON>, a senior trader at the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office. `` While the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is concerned about the level of the dollar, their major priority is to keep inflation'' down, he added. Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar was undermined by speculation that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> was considering a cut in the discount rate, its interest charge on loans to member banks. Lower interest rates make <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investments less attractive to foreigners, thereby diminishing their need for dollars. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said that despite the fact that the dollar is holding to key levels, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency is likely to come under pressure because interest rate differentials have narrowed considerably. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates currently are about 2.5 percent higher than those in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, he said. `` And historically, as it gets under 3 percent, the dollar comes under pressure,'' <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON> said, adding that earlier this year the spread was as high as 5 percent, `` which had kept the underlying support of the dollar all year.'' Separately, the British pound got a boost from comments by Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>, who told the governing <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s annual conference he would continue to fight inflation with high interest rates for as long as necessary. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar rose to 144.60 Japanese yen, from 143.90 yen. Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar traded lower at 144.25 yen. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar finished at 144.15 yen, down from 144.50 yen on Wednesday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, one British pound cost $ 1.5520, more expensive for buyers than Wednesday's late $ 1.5425. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, it cost $ 1.5527 to buy one pound, more expensive than $ 1.5460 on Wednesday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with Wednesday's late rates, included: 1.9075 West German marks, down from 1.9155; 1.6735 Swiss francs, down from 1.6800; 6.4670 French francs, down from 6.4900; 1,399.25 Italian lire, down from 1,403.00, and 1.1749 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1748 Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with Wednesday's late rates included: 1.9068 West German marks, down from 1.9185; 1.6715 Swiss francs, down from 1.6785; 6.4650 French francs, down from 4.4925; 2.1510 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1630; 1,397.50 Italian lire, down from 1,403.25, and 1.1737 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1750 Gold traded late in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid of $ 362.75 a troy ounce, up from $ 361.25 Wednesday.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> reached tentative agreement on a new accord increasing slightly the European share of the American steel market, the trading bloc announced Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the community's executive body, said the European share would rise from 6.68 percent to 7 percent under the new arrangement, which will remain in effect until March 31, 1992. The accord, which still must be approved by the 12 nations of the European Community, means European producers could increase exports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by almost 300,000 metric tons. The trading bloc exported 5.9 million metric tons of steel products to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1988. <PERSON> Frans </PERSON> <PERSON> Andriessen </PERSON>, the community's top trading official, told members of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, `` The results are not unsatisfactory but -LRB- we are -RRB- bound to see it with mixed feelings.'' `` There was no need for an agreement... Objectively speaking, it was unnecessary,'' he said The arrangement stems from a decision in July by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to extend steel import quotas, which were first put in place in 1984. They had been set to expire on Sept. 30. The restrictions set annual limits on the amount of steel that can be brought into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from 29 countries, including those of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said the new agreement covered the same steel products and that some terms of the arrangement were improved, particularly for the export of goods in short supply in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It said the 30-month extension of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> restrictions was a `` credible step toward the liberalization of the steel trade.'' In <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, the community's legislative body, said it regretted the new agreement limiting European sales in light of the improvement in the American steel industry It said the accord could complicate international trade talks for a broader steel pact. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> quotas were first imposed at a time the American steel industry was suffering heavy losses. Steelmakers complained they were hurt by foreign producers who were helped by big government subsidies and import restrictions. They say they have benefited from the quotas but argue they still need more time to modernize their operations.

He was defeated in a 1986 bid for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> by incumbent Republican <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickles </PERSON> and earlier this year lost a race for the chairmanship of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who served on <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s staff from 1965-1969 was the president's last chief of staff. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> also was chairman of a task force on U.S.-Japan trade relations and said he would make foreign market contacts a priority for the Amex. The Amex, which caters to medium-sized companies, is far outpaced in volume by the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and the NASDAQ over-the-counter market traded electronically nationwide.

But Amex in recent years has curbed the decline in its listed companies, marketed itself well domestically and abroad, emerged as a leader in options trading and offered innovative new products and services. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said he would use his contacts in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and abroad to try to `` add to a climate of economic growth and capital formation'' and help mid-sized companies develop capital and develop markets around the world. `` I think there are a lot mid-sized companies that are either unfamiliar or unsure of themselves in both markets,'' he said. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a partner in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> law firm of <ORGANIZATION> Dickstein </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shapiro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Morin </PERSON>, also said his contacts in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> `` will be very helpful as we move into this global marketplace and find a niche for the Amex.''

<HEAD>Money Supply Measures Move in Opposite Directions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The two broadest measures of the nation's money supply moved in opposite directions in the week ended Oct. 2, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,165.7 billion from $ 3,159.7 billion the previous week. An even broader measure, M3, fell to a seasonally adjusted $ 4,005.2 billion from $ 4,006.0 billion. The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a seasonally adjusted $ 789.3 billion from $ 782.5 billion. M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations of $ 100,000. In judging its monetary policy, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has indicated it is monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the difference between short - and long-term interest rates It also has shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply measures. The annual growth rate in M2 so far this year is 3.6 percent, which is within the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s target range of 3 percent to 7 percent. The annual growth rate in M3 is 4 percent, which is within the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s target range of 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has not set a target for M1 growth since early 1987. For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $ 3,138.2 billion, a 7.4 percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous 13 weeks. M3 averaged $ 4,008.2 billion, up 4.5 percent, while M1 rose 1.8 percent to an average of $ 779.0 billion. In other reports: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said bank borrowings from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> at the discount window, excluding extended credit, averaged $ 800 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, down from $ 953 million the previous week _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> reported that the monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank reserves held at <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> banks and cash in bank vaults and in circulation, was $ 291.7 billion in the two-week period ended Oct. 4, down from $ 293.5 billion two weeks earlier

<HEAD>Pork Bellies Soar The Limit As Supply Fears Mount</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Frozen pork-belly futures prices soared the permitted 2-cents-a-pound daily limit Thursday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Thursday amid growing supply fears rooted in the government's decision to ship pork bellies to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. On other commodity markets, copper and precious metals futures advanced, grains and soybeans were mixed; and energy futures were mostly higher. Frozen pork bellies futures settled 2 cents higher across the board with the contract for delivery in February at 49.72 cents a pound. The rally followed a surge of buying on Wednesday and may reflect the market's uneasiness about the government's plan to ship $ 10 million worth of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pork bellies to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> as part of a food-aid package. Pork bellies are the part of a pig from which bacon is made. With stocks of frozen pork bellies at historically high levels, supply tightness would seem to be low on the market's list of concerns. But under the rules of the futures market, only bellies frozen after Nov. 1 are deliverable against any of the futures contracts currently trading. And some of the surplus bellies produced this winter _ perhaps as much as 15 million pounds' worth _ are destined to be sent to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> instead of being packed away in commercial freezers for domestic use later on. Traders fear that the large stockpile of bellies currently in freezers may be too old to guarantee their quality if they were to be shipped to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. But the government has not yet decided on the specifications for the Polish shipment. `` The longer the government delays in outlining the specifications of the product that has to go to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, the more uncertain the situation becomes ... and the more nervous the futures market becomes,'' said <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON>, senior livestock analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. In livestock trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>, live cattle futures settled .20 cent lower to .07 cent higher with October at 73 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent lower to .42 cent higher with October at 83.10 cents a pound; live hogs were .10 cent lower to 1.05 cent higher with October at 48.67 cents a pound. Copper futures rose on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> after the Arizona-based copper producer <ORGANIZATION> Magma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Copper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> announced it was forced to cancel some shipments due to equipment problems. Copper settled 1.2 cents to 1.45 cents higher with December at $ 1.3035 a pound. In precious-metals trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, gold settled $ 1.30 to $ 1.50 higher with October at $ 363.40 a troy ounce; silver was 1 cent to 1.4 cents higher with December at $ 5.153 a troy ounce. Grain and soybean futures ended narrowly mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> ahead of the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s eagerly-awaited monthly crop report The report, which was released after the close, estimated the 1989 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn crop at 7.45 billion bushels, up 2 percent from last month's projection of projection of 7.32 billion bushels and 51 percent higher than the drought-shriveled 1988 crop of 4.92 billion bushels. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> estimated the 1989 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybean crop at 1.93 billion bushels, up 2 percent from last month's projection of 1.89 billion and 24 percent larger than last year's harvest of 1.54 billion. And the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> estimated total 1989 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat production at 2.04 billion bushels, up 13 percent from last year, but 1 percent below the September forecast of 2.06 billion bushels. The corn and soybean numbers were above market expectations and analysts said the report may send corn and soybean futures prices moderately lower at Friday's opening. Wheat futures were expected to open slightly higher Friday in response to the report. Wheat futures settled 2 cents to 2 -RCB- cents higher with December at $ 4.06 -RCB- a bushel; corn futures were 1 -RCB- cents lower to \ cent higher with December at $ 2.35 \ a bushel; oats were unchanged to -LCB- cent higher with December at $ 1.40 -RCB- a bushel; soybeans were 2 -LCB- cents lower to \ cent higher with November at $ 5.52 -LCB- a bushel Wholesale home heating oil prices rallied strongly on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> amid speculation about temporary tightness in supplies. Crude oil futures prices also posted gains while gasoline futures finished mixed. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 8 cents to 26 cents higher with November at $ 20.47 a barrel; heating oil was .57 cent to 1.36 cents higher with November at 61.17 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .16 cent lower to .55 cent higher with November at 55.57 cents a gallon.

<HEAD>Two Big Insurers Agree to Pay Fines, Testify in Texas Suit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL HOLMES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two major insurance companies agreed Thursday to pay $ 500,000 each and testify in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' antitrust lawsuit against other of the nation's largest insurers, Attorney General <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Mattox </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mattox </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Travelers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> also agreed to stop certain industry activities in a settlement agreement signed by state District Judge <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowry </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>. In the agreements, both companies denied any wrongdoing or liability. The pacts say each $ 500,000 payment is for investigative and legal costs and `` does not represent a fine or penalty.'' `` In essence, these companies have entered a nolo contendere -LRB- no contest -RRB- plea and have agreed to testify for the state as the lawsuit continues against the other defendants,'' <PERSON> Mattox </PERSON> said. The state accuses the insurance industry of seeking to create a phony `` insurance crisis'' several years ago in which insurers claimed that an increase in lawsuits was forcing them out of the commercial liability field. <PERSON> Mattox </PERSON> in March 1988 sued eight major insurance companies and other insurance groups, accusing them of illegally conspiring to boycott, coerce and intimidate insurance consumers in order to drive up rates, cut back coverage and create a false insurance crisis in the commercial liability field. Several other states joined a similar suit filed in federal court in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` We fully intend to proceed with our legal action against all these other defendants. As a prosecutor, I can explain it to you like this: Sometimes you cut a deal with one member of a gang in order to put the entire gang out of business,'' he said. `` We are asking the court to set us a trial date as soon as possible for the rest'' of the defendants, <PERSON> Mattox </PERSON> said. The state's lawsuit seeks civil penalties and restitution for consumers. The civil penalties could range up to $ 1 million for each violation of the state's antitrust law by corporate defendants and up to $ 100,000 for each violation by individuals. Spokesmen for both <ORGANIZATION> Travelers </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> said their companies believe they would have won but decided to settle because of the costs involved. `` We look at this as a very cost-effective way for the company to avoid further legal expense, a lot of inconvenience and a lot of burden on our shareholders,'' said <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Suzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagen </PERSON>. `` We feel confident that if it would have gone to its conclusion, there would have been a ruling in our favor. But the costs of doing this would have far outdistanced the benefits we would have been getting,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Travelers </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaferle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mattox </PERSON> recalled a television advertising campaign in which the insurance industry contended that the crisis would hinder everything from high school football games to fire protection. When his suit was filed, <PERSON> Mattox </PERSON> charged the insurance industry with `` the most insidious consumer fraud perpetrated upon the American public in decades.'' <PERSON> Mattox </PERSON>'s investigation began with a letter from the <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Westlake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, which was notified in 1985 that its liability coverage was being canceled. `` After years with the same liability carriers, <PERSON> Westlake </PERSON>'s coverage was suddenly canceled despite the fact that the city had only one minor claim since becoming a city in 1953,'' he said

<HEAD>Chemical Boosts Loan Loss Reserve, Posts $825 Million Quarterly Loss</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES throughout with Chemical Bank's $900 million addition
to loan-loss reserve and $825 million third quarter loss. No pickup.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it added $ 900 million to its cushion against possible loan losses, resulting in an $ 824.6 million third-quarter loss for the nation's fifth largest bank holding company. Also on Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> announced a $ 600 million increase in its allowance to cover potentially bad loans. The provision caused <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> to post a loss of $ 271.3 million in the third quarter. Chemical and <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> joined a lengthening list of big <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks that recently have bolstered their protection against losses amid a widespread perception that economic and political difficulties in the Third World might make it impossible for countries to repay their debts. <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> were among the nation's major money-center banks that previously announced they were substantially boosting their loan-loss reserves. Chemical said in a news release that it has made a special $ 600 million provision to its reserve for losses on loans to countries engaged in debt rescheduling negotiations. Chemical's allowance for losses on loans to troubled Third World debtors has grown to $ 1.84 billion on account of the addition. Another $ 300 million was set aside to cover possible losses on nonperforming loans at <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancshares </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary. Chemical has been trying to weed out shaky loans at <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancshares </ORGANIZATION> since acquiring it in 1987. The federally-assisted bailout and recapitalization of numerous <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> banks has weighed down the state's real estate market. By making the $ 300 million provision, <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> was attempting to insulate future earnings from expected losses on the disposal of nonperforming <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancshares </ORGANIZATION>' loans. In a move aimed at enhancing its equity capital position, <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> also announced plans to issue $ 500 million in common stock. Chemical said it soon would file a registration statement with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Chemical's loss for the quarter ended Sept. 30 came to $ 12.89 a share. In 1988's third quarter, <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 211.9 million or $ 3.43 a share, a period in which results benefited from several nonrecurring gains. Chemical lost $ 578.1 million, or $ 9.75 a share, in the first nine months of 1989 compared to after-tax income of $ 465.1 million, or $ 7.36 a share, in the corresponding 1988 period. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said its loss for the quarter ended Sept. 30, which came to $ 4.10 a share, compared with income of $ 54.2 million, or $ 1.51 a share, a year earlier. But without the special addition to its loan loss allowance, <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> would have earned $ 118.7 million, or $ 1.60 a share on a fully diluted basis, in the quarter. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacot </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive officer, said $ 400 million of the special addition was designated to cover loans to Third World countries, and the remainder was set aside for other unspecified loans. `` Our decision was prompted by recent developments regarding Lesser Developed Country debt negotiations, and is consistent with our policy of maintaining appropriate reserves for the entire loan portfolio,'' <PERSON> Bacot </PERSON> said in a news release. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said its provision for <ORGANIZATION> LDC </ORGANIZATION> loans now stands at $ 938.6 million out of a total loan-loss allowance of $ 1.52 billion. The bank's earnings, meanwhile, were said to be strong. The bank benefited from cost savings related to its $ 1.4 billion acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, completed in December of last year. Revenue growth from securities processing operations also contributed to third quarter results. For the nine months ended Sept. 30, <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> reported a loss of $ 55.9 million, or $ 1.18 per share, compared to the prior year's income of $ 158.3 million, or $ 4.52 a share. Excluding the special addition, nine-month earnings would have been $ 334.1 million, or $ 4.52 a share, fully diluted, which includes common stock and equivalents. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said it expects to post a profit for all of this year.

<TEXT>
 The largest aircraft deal in <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> history, $ 5.2 billion in orders and options for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> jets, was good news Thursday to striking production workers as well as to company officials. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Longridge </PERSON>, vice president of sales at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION>, said the show of confidence on the ninth day of a strike by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> was appreciated. `` <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> is happy with the good relationship our companies have enjoyed over the years, and we look forward to working closely with <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s new management to further strengthen those ties,'' <PERSON> Longridge </PERSON> said. Striking machinists saw the order as more evidence that they're needed `` It's wonderful. It means we'll have more work for a long time to come,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>, communications director of <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 751 </ORGANIZATION>. `` But you ca n't get paid for it until you build them.'' A statement issued by <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> called the order a `` testament to the new ownership's and new management's commitment to the people of the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> and the growth of the company. Northwest ordered six <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747-400s, the world's largest passenger jet, and 40 757-200s, a shorter-range, highly fuel-efficient twinjet, and took options on four 747-400s and 40 757-200s. The planes, scheduled for delivery from late 1993 through 1998, were ordered with <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> PW2000 and PW4000 engines, making the deal worth $ 1.5 billion or more to the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, manufacturer. Chief corporate spokesman <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> said the deal boosted <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s orders to 788 planes worth $ 42 billion this year, the fifth straight year of record orders, and the backlog of firm orders _ excluding options _ to 1,644 planes worth $ 82 billion with deliveries extending into the late 1990s. Those figures do not include an order announced Wednesday by <ORGANIZATION> Cathay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> for two 747-400 freighters and options on two more models for a total potential pricetag of about $ 600 million because the deal was still being confirmed Thursday, <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> said. Last Friday company officials announced an order by <ORGANIZATION> Evergreen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> for four 747-400s and two extended-range 767-300ERs and options for a like number of the same planes worth as much as $ 1.93 billion. Production has been grinding to a halt at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> since the union representing about 57,800 workers, including 43,300 Puget Sound-area members of <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 751 </ORGANIZATION>, went on strike Oct. 4. The Machinists also represent about 12,000 workers in <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, 1,700 in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, and a few hundred in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and other states. Four planes have been delivered since the strike began, and company officials said about three dozen more were close enough to completion for non-striking personnel to finish them. <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> said senior <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> officials had heard no concern from customers about delivery problems. The <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> order was the third received by <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> during the strike. `` It's certainly not going to be an issue at the bargaining table,'' <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> said. Local union president <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> should start to feel the heat soon. `` I just do n't know how they can withstand a prolonged work stoppage without facing a great deal of pressure,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` The company is not going to be able to deliver the existing aircraft, much less these -LRB- new orders -RRB-, without us being back on the job.'' Federal mediator <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> said Thursday he was remaining in contact with both sides, but no talks were scheduled. There have been no negotiations since the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> voted 85 percent to strike rather than accept a three-year offer featuring wage hikes of 4 percent, 3 percent and 3 percent, bonuses of 8 percent of gross pay this year and 3 percent in 1990, a cost-of-living clause to virtually match inflation, a reduction in mandatory overtime and increases in some benefits.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, parent of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, on Thursday reported third-quarter profits of $ 945 million, or $ 1.04 a share, as most divisions showed increases while broadcasting was about level. <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> said its quarterly profits rose 16 percent from $ 815 million, or 90 cents a share, in the same 1988 period. Revenues were $ 13 billion, compared to $ 12.2 billion in the previous third quarter. <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> said profits from its broadcasting operations remained about the same despite a drop in revenue because last year's third quarter included the 1988 Olympics. Earnings were particularly strong in financial services, plastics, transportation systems and power generation, <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> said. `` This strong earnings performance continues to reflect widespread productivity improvements as well as sales growth in a number of our businesses,'' he said. Revenues for the first nine months of 1989 totaled $ 38.4 billion, up 11 percent from $ 34.6 billion for the first nine months of 1988. Net earnings for the first nine months were $ 2.76 billion, or $ 3.06 a share, up from $ 2.38 billion, or $ 2.63 a share, in the previous nine-month period.

 Production of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s full-size vans will be moved to <LOCATION> Flint </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, from plants in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, leaving production lines there idled in late 1991, company and union officials said Thursday. The 4,700 workers at <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s Truck and <ORGANIZATION> Bus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> plant in <LOCATION> Flint </LOCATION> had been waiting for such an announcement and it was greeted with relief and celebration. The news was n't good for the 2,500 van workers at <LOCATION> Lordstown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. `` No further product is scheduled for the -LRB- <LOCATION> Lordstown </LOCATION> -RRB- van plant,'' said <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Workman </PERSON>. `` At <LOCATION> Lordstown </LOCATION>, the focus will be on passenger cars in the future.'' In addition to the full-size vans, the sprawling <LOCATION> Lordstown </LOCATION> complex makes Chevrolet Cavalier and Pontiac Sunbird automobiles. There are about 11,500 people employed at the plant in the <LOCATION> Youngstown </LOCATION> suburb about 50 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> said it was looking for another product to put in its Scarborough, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, plant, which employs about 2,700 people. Earlier this year, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> said it would end production in Flint of three light-duty trucks and move it to <LOCATION> Janesville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, in late 1991. At that time, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> said it was looking for another product to put in the <LOCATION> Flint </LOCATION> truck factory. `` Last February we said we would have a vehicle to be named later at <LOCATION> Flint </LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Klipstine </PERSON> said Thursday in a statement. `` We have now named that product.'' He said the timing of the move, how many employees may be affected and how much time it would take to retool the factory for full-size van production had n't been determined. But <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Pruett </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 598 </ORGANIZATION> at the plant, said the change would be completed in time for late 1991 production of 1992 models, employment at <LOCATION> Flint </LOCATION> should n't be affected too much and the plant would be shut down for about five months for the changeover. `` We've got people jumping up and down here,'' he said by telephone. `` We had some people who were really scared. This is really great for us.''

 Continued weakness in the market for `` junk'' bonds is casting doubt on prospects for $ 11 billion worth of these securities that companies plan to issue by year end, market players said. Prices of the high-yield debt securities, which frequently are used to raise money for small - or medium-sized businesses with slim credit histories, dropped again Thursday Issues were down on average about 1 point, or $ 10 for every $ 1,000 in face amount.

 Stock prices lost ground for the third straight session Thursday as traders warily awaited the latest government data on inflation. The Dow Jones industrials average fell 13.52 to 2,759.84, bringing its loss over the last three days to 31.57 points. The dollar fell in subdued dealings. Bonds closed marginally higher. Frozen pork-belly futures prices soared the permitted 2-cents-a-pound daily limit; copper and precious metals futures advanced; grains and soybeans were mixed; and energy futures were mostly higher.

 <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it has placed orders and options for $ 5.2 billion worth of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> jets, the largest order in <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s history. `` This order is a testament to the new ownership's and new management's commitment to the people of <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> and the growth of the company,'' said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Malek </PERSON>, who last month was named president of the nation's fourth-largest carrier by its new chairman, <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON>. Northwest ordered six <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747-400s and secured options on four more of the 420-passenger, high-technology jumbo jets. In addition, the airline bought 40 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 757-200 twin jets and placed options on 40 more. The order comes even as <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has been hit with a strike by production workers. In <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> Thursday, <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Longridge </PERSON>, vice president of sales at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION>, said the show of confidence in <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> was appreciated. Striking <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> workers said the reports of the impending order bolstered their contention that <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> can afford a better wage and benefit offer. Value of the firm orders in today's dollars is about $ 2.7 billion and the options represent another $ 2.5 billion, <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> told a news conference at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport Deliveries of aircraft included in this order are scheduled between the second half of 1993 and 1998. <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, which earlier this year became the first airline to fly the 747-400, will power the new 747-400s with <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Whitney PW4000 engines. Northwest already operates the world's largest fleet of 747-400s with five in service now and five more scheduled for delivery by the end of 1990. <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> plans to use the new 747-400s on routes to and from <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. Projections show that trans-Pacific markets will continue to grow at a double-digit pace, he said, adding that the range, payload and fuel efficiency of the 400 make it an excellent choice for high density Asian routes. The 757 orders and options will bring <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s fleet of these 184-passenger twin jets to 113 aircraft. The 757s will be powered by <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Whitney </LOCATION> PW2037 engines, which are designed for fuel efficiency and low community noise levels. Northwest, purchased in June by a group of investors led by <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON>, received its first 757 in 1985 and currently operates 33 of them. The 757s, with transcontinental range, will be used on medium - and long-haul domestic routes, <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> said With Thursday's $ 5.2 billion transaction, <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> has 229 aircraft on order for delivery through the 1990s for a total value of more than $ 11.5 billion.

 A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel on Thursday lashed out at the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to place quotas on imported television programs and urged President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to use trade sanctions if necessary to assure <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> access to European viewers. The House Ways and Means subcommittee on trade, in a unanimous voice vote, approved a non-binding resolution that said the 10-2 vote on Oct. 3 by the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION> was illegal under terms of the 96-nation General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs. The resolution said the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> `` deplores the damage which will be inflicted on <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> broadcasting, film and related industries'' and urged <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> `` to take all feasible action under its authority, including possible action under section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, to protect and maintain <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> access to the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> broadcasting market.'' Section 301 authorizes the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative to take action against a foreign nation that discriminates against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commerce. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> said she would file a fair-trade complaint with <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> against the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> over the Oct. 3 directive, which urges the 12 member nations to take steps to limit imports to no more than half of all shows aired. Although the so-called Television Without Frontiers directive was not binding on <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> nations, <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> said it was `` blatantly protectionist'' and discriminates against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and other non-European Community film goods. Although <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> has no police power over the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Hills </PERSON>' action indicated the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration was having second thoughts about the plan to drop internal trade barriers by the end of 1992. Commerce Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> also has told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> the administration is concerned that the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> will impose local content rules in areas such as television, computer chips, telecommunications equipment and automobiles. According to industry figures, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> realizes a $ 3 billion annual surplus balance of trade through film and TV exports, and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is the leading market for such programs with about $ 700 million in purchases yearly. TV series such as `` Miami Vice'' and `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>'' are very popular in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, which has caused legislators there to decry the `` Americanization'' of their citizenry. Officials estimate that out of 125,000 hours of TV shown in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> annually, only 20,000 hours are produced in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> provide the bulk of the remainder. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> resolution was sponsored by Rep. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., and had 14 co-sponsors, the subcommittee staff said

 The state <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utilities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday scrapped its 50-year-old system of regulating telephone rates and adopted a new plan tying rates to inflation, encouraging new technology and promising <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> customers a rate decrease. `` Local telephone companies are becoming more like competitive businesses and should be treated that way,'' the commission's president, <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilk </PERSON>, said before the new system was approved on a 5-0 vote <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bell </LOCATION> and GTE <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the other company affected, both praised the plan. A consumer group, <ORGANIZATION> Toward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utility </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Normalization </ORGANIZATION>, called it `` a dangerous ride down an unmapped road.'' The plan, effective next year, is part of an overall policy by the current <ORGANIZATION> PUC </ORGANIZATION>, appointed by Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>, to loosen some of its traditional regulation and scrutiny of management decisions by utility companies in telecommunications, energy and transportation. Current phone rates are based on the commission's determination of major phone companies' revenue needs, based on its costs, efficiency and the state of the economy. Under the new system, rates will be changed annually according to this formula: a federal inflation index called the Gross National Product Price Index will be reduced by 4.5 percent, based on the assumption that phone companies can increase their productivity by that amount each year. For example, if inflation was 4.8 percent, the figure shown by the index this past March, the rate increase would be .3 percent. The companies' basic rate of return on investment would be set at 11.5 percent as of Jan. 1. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Danner </PERSON>, an aide to <PERSON> Wilk </PERSON>, said the result would probably be a rate decrease of $ 100 million or more for <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> next year and probably little change for <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION>, which had a 20 percent rate cut last year. If a company increased its efficiency to earn a higher rate of return, stockholders could keep all amounts up to 13 percent. Additional earnings up to 16.5 percent would be split 50-50 with ratepayers, and any amounts above 16.5 percent would belong to ratepayers. Sometime next year, the current $ 1.20-a-month charge for touch-tone telephone service would be eliminated, and the free local calling area would be expanded from eight to 12 miles. The <ORGANIZATION> PUC </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Pacific </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> would be allowed to spend $ 405 million to modernize its system over the next three years so that 950,000 customers would have access to services they now lack, including touch-tone phones and blocking of `` dial-a-porn'' and other tape-message fee calls. The commission will also let phone companies cut prices for some high-tech and business-oriented services, and require the companies to assume all financial risks of many new services while keeping all revenues from those services.

 Fears that a computer virus will trash information on some personal computers are overblown, experts said Thursday, but some alarmed users have taken steps to make sure they do n't wake up Friday the 13th with the infection. `` Our advice to people is stop worrying,'' said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinauer </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>. `` People should make a backup copy of their files and do n't call me in the morning. There's virtually no way it can spread around and cause any significant damage at all.'' But others feel the threat is real from the so-called Columbus Day virus, programmed to activate after computers' internal clocks hit 12:01 a.m. Friday and begin doing its dirty work when an operator begins using an infected program. `` We're talking about a communicable disease that is absolutely indiscriminate,'' said <PERSON> Winn </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartau </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION> `` It's not going to be Armageddon today or tomorrow. But if you ignore it and you're infected, the risk is high for getting your data destroyed,'' <PERSON> Schwartau </PERSON> said. By coincidence, more than 2,000 of the nation's top computer security experts convened their annual meeting Thursday in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, Md. Few, if any, opted to stay on the job because of the virus threat, according to the sponsoring <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. Only a tiny fraction of the nation's 40 million users of personal computers are expected to catch the virus, officials said at a news conference. `` We want to send a calming message to people that if they take reasonable precautions, this virus poses no more danger than any other,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Malarkey </PERSON>, deputy chief of the computer service office of the federal <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. A computer virus is the electronic equivalent of a biological bug. It is a malevolent program designed to sneak through a computer system on infected disks or in programs copied over networks from electronic bulletin boards. Once activated, the rogue program copies itself like a breeding germ, eating away processing power and storage space or even destroying information. About 30 viruses are known to exist, not counting strains and mutations. The Columbus Day virus, also known as Datacrime, is programmed to scramble indexing information in <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> or IBM-compatible personal computers. It would be the equivalent of zapping index cards in a library so books would be impossible to locate. The virus, of unknown origin, has been identified about 12 times since March 1, when experts discovered suspicious strings of code that had attached themselves to programs. The confirmed cases of Columbus Day viruses were discovered before they did any real damage. A number of programmers, including <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, have developed ways to detect if a disk or program has been contaminated. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> took 2,000 calls since Oct. 2 on a special hotline for people who want its virus scanning program. `` We're taking the threat seriously,'' said <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>. `` You do n't defeat computer viruses. You detect them and erase them.'' In <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, the Budget and <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> checked its computers. `` It's being handled exactly like a bomb threat,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Huckabee </PERSON>. `` I think you have to be serious about it, but not necessarily alarmist.'' Also lurking in computer networks is another virus which has strains known as <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, Friday the 13th or <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> <PERSON> Sura </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Antiquity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Piano </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Amboy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, on Monday lost all the business information he had in two computers to the <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> strain. `` How would you feel if every piece of business information was stuck on a computer and you could n't get it out?

<HEAD>Eds: ADDS 4 grafs to UPDATE with American Airlines questioning British
Airways' involvement in UAL deal.</HEAD>

 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> pilot and management representatives met with <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials Thursday after the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union asked the agency to block a proposed employee buyout of the airline, a department spokesman said. The agency called leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> buyout group to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> `` to meet with us and describe the details of the proposed transaction,'' said department spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. The Machinists union, representing more than a third of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s 70,000 employees, has asked the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to block the group's $ 6.75 billion buyout of the nation's second-largest airline, contending it is too high-priced and unfair to employees In a letter to department officials, the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> said the proposed deal violates sections of the Employment Retirement Income Security Act, which governs use of employee investment funds. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said that after gathering the facts, the department would `` make a judgment under the ERISA as to what, if any problems exist with the proposed buyout.'' Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> chapter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attendants </ORGANIZATION> hit what it called a number of major stumbling blocks in contract negotiations aimed at giving the attendants an ownership stake in <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>. Union spokeswoman <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> said at least one of those hurdles `` may prove to be insurmountable.'' The only unionized employees committed to participating in the buyout are <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s 7,000 pilots, who are leading the takeover group that also includes <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s top management and <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>. The company's 24,000 non-union workers would automatically participate in an employee stock ownership plan if the buyout, which has been approved by <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s board, goes through. The pilots have said they are prepared to proceed with the $ 300-a-share deal regardless of whether fellow unions participate. Nonetheless, disunity among the workers has raised questions about the chance of the buyout's long-term success. In trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> climbed $ 3.25 a share to $ 285. The pilots have agreed to accept contract concessions of $ 250 million a year and have voted by a 9-to-1 margin to commit $ 200 million from their $ 1.2 billion pension fund to buy preferred stock in the employee stock ownership plan. In a three-page letter delivered Wednesday to Labor Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, the Machinists charged that the tax benefits of the proposed buyout `` are effectively subsidizing a substantial and excessive windfall'' for <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s management and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s pilots. The letter, signed by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterpaul </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION>' union, also contended the purchase price approved by <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s board is too high and that the buyout would result in `` significant risk and inefficiency'' caused by `` ongoing labor strife and disharmony.'' <PERSON> Peterpaul </PERSON> referred calls about the letter to <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, financial adviser for the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, who did not immediately return telephone calls. <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said agency officials were meeting to consider the letter. The pilots had no comment on the letter, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Kathie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardin </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The Machinists previously said they opposed the deal because of the increased debt it would involve and the uncertain prospects for the company's continued prosperity. The deal also is under scrutiny by the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which has expressed concern about debt-financed buyouts and foreign stakes in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines. Ms. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> said contract negotiators for the 14,000 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> flight attendants have balked at company proposals to increase the attendants' share of their medical costs and to increase the number of foreign-language-speaking attendants on international flights. She said the latter proposal would unfairly reduce the international flight opportunities for senior attendants who do not speak a foreign language. Meanwhile Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, parent of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, issued a statement saying it had asked the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> `` to make fundamental changes'' in the air service agreement between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> before allowing <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> to participate in the <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> buyout. AMR, which is weighing a $ 7 billion takeover offer from <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, said the <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> deal `` represents a unilateral opening of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aviation markets'' and `` it is unsound as a matter of policy, and it is inconsistent with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to attain fair trading relationships.'' AMR spokesman <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> said the company did not object in general to <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> participation in the deal, but believes the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government should require <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to open up its markets to greater access by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers. <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> said American has been stymied in its efforts to open up non-stop Chicago-London and New York-Manchester routes because `` the British government is one of the most restrictive in the world'' in allowing foreign carriers access to its markets.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Options </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> wo n't be just for options anymore, officials of the exchange announced Thursday. The world's biggest options marketplace is planning to launch a stock market basket during the week of Oct. 23, pending <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> approval. The new product, a basket made up of all the stocks in the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index, represents the Options Exchanges' latest attempt to boost its trading volume, which dropped dramatically after the 1987 stock market crash The exchange reported volume of 9.69 million trades last month, up 10 percent from 8.84 million in September 1988 but still 46 percent below the pre-crash September 1987 volume of 17.78 million trades. The market basket, the exchange's first non-option product, is designed for use by institutional investors. Investors who buy the market basket will actually be buying shares in each of the 500 stocks represented in the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P 500 index, with the number of shares in each stock determined by its relative weight in the index. The basket's value will be equal to $ 5,000 times the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P 500 index level, or about $ 1.79 million currently. The product will lend itself to various trading strategies involving stocks and stock options, the exchange said in a statement. The Options Exchange trades options on 204 stocks, on the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P 500 and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P 100 indexes, on interest rates and on <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds and notes. An option is a right, but not an obligation, to buy or sell a commodity or financial product at a specified price by a specified date.

<HEAD>CFTC Head to Futures Industry: Reform Now or Pay Later</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The futures industry needs to get behind market reforms now or it will wind up paying for those enacted by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> without any say in the matter, a top federal futures regulator warned Thursday. `` In the upcoming year, the future of the futures industry will be written, for better or for worse, in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, not in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, chairwoman of the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. In a speech prepared for the <ORGANIZATION> Commodities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, the text of which was released here, Ms. <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> said recent events have placed the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> and the industry it oversees `` under more public and congressional scrutiny than ever before.'' In July, an emergency soybean futures liquidation order on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, reportedly caused by an alleged attempt to corner the market, led to wild price fluctuations that had traders and farmers howling. In August, more than 40 traders and brokers at the <ORGANIZATION> CBOT </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's two largest futures exchanges, were indicted on a variety of charges _ including racketeering _ for alleged schemes to defraud customers. Several already have pleaded guilty. Earlier this year it was revealed that futures markets in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> also are under investigation, although no charges have been brought. After a series of congressional hearings and reports by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the accounting arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, `` the very legitimacy and integrity of the markets are being challenged,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>. A reform bill already has been passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and another is being considered by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nutrition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has scheduled hearings in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for Tuesday. Ms. <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> said her agency supports `` the general goals'' of both bills, which require exchanges to toughen record keeping standards that would allow investigators to precisely reconstruct a given transaction, a process known as following the `` audit trail.'' But she said the agency has some reservations `` in terms of necessity and practicability'' about aspects of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill that would require recording of transactions to within 30 seconds of their occurrance. The House bill also would require the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> to monitor and approve changes in the margin levels, or the amount of collateral put up to buy stock index futures. Ms. <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, a supporter of the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> policy of self-regulation by the exchanges, said that could all be changed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> depending on `` industry, exchange and <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> response to the call for reforms.'' She said the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> was proposing reforms to detect and deter trading abuses but `` the industry needs to show those writing the reform agenda in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that they are prepared to act, and act decisively, to ensure market integrity. Only in this way can public confidence in these markets be maintained.''

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Harley-Davidson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it wants the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to investigate businessman <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON>'s move to increase his group's stake in the company to 15 percent. Executives of Milwaukee-based <PERSON> Harley </PERSON>, the last <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturer of motorcycles, have said they are determined to stay independent despite a possible takeover bid by the <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON> group. <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON> announced Oct. 2 that his investor group had acquired 6.24 percent of <PERSON> Harley </PERSON> stock. The company, in a statement, said Thursday it asked the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> to investigate <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON>'s announcement he filed Wednesday for clearance to raise his group's stake to 15 percent. Federal law requires <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> clearance for such a move, but <PERSON> Harley </PERSON> said it did not receive the required prior written notice of the filing. The company said it also asked the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> to look into <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON>'s indicated expenditure of more than $ 15 million to acquire <PERSON> Harley </PERSON> stock without the required advance clearance of an investment in a company exceeding that amount `` As previously announced, the company does not intend to sell the company to Mr. <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON> or any other party and has not had any contact with Mr. <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON> or any of his representatives,'' the <PERSON> Harley </PERSON> statement said. <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON>'s group, based at <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, said Wednesday it was still studying `` a full range of options'' regarding <PERSON> Harley </PERSON>. <PERSON> Harley </PERSON> stock lost 25 cents to close at $ 40.50 a share in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite trading Thursday. Last year, <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON> bought 9.9 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Formica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s stock and offered to buy the entire company. His overtures were rejected and a management-led group subsequently took the laminate maker private. <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON> is chairman of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which he said has interests in more than 30 companies in 12 states, including television stations, real estate, health care and banking.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Affiliated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, parent company of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION>, reported Thursday it earned $ 8.48 million in the third quarter though revenue declined. The profit for the quarter ended Sept. 24, which amounted to 12 cents a share, compared with a loss of $ 25.6 million, or 38 cents a share, in the third quarter of 1988. Affiliated said declining newspaper income in the third quarter led to a 2.9 percent drop in overall revenue, to a total of $ 126.3 million, compared with revenue of $ 130.1 million for the same period last year. Income from the company's continuing operations declined 20 percent in the third quarter, from $ 10.69 million to the $ 8.48 million net income figure, the company said. That figure excludes charges that stemmed from losses in Affiliated's investment in <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cellular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Kirkland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash </LOCATION>. Earlier this year, Affiliated restructured that investment, separating its publishing operations from the troubled cellular business. Newspaper revenue declined 4.1 percent in the third quarter, and operating income from the newspaper declined 16.6 percent. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer, said the company's earnings continued to be affected by softness in advertising volume at the Globe. For the first nine months of this year, income totaled $ 2.9 million, or 4 cents a share, compared with a loss of $ 51.4 million, or 74 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Revenue this year totaled $ 394.4 million, compared with $ 397.2 million for the same period in 1988.

<HEAD>Dollar Plunges, Share Prices Rebound Sharply</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar opened sharply lower against the Japanese yen Friday morning, while share prices on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchage </ORGANIZATION> shot up. The dollar started trading at 143.60 yen, down 1.00 yen from Thursday's <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> finish. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, it closed at 144.20 yen overnight. The dollar's plunge at the opening of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> trading followed its downswing overnight in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where investors sold the currency following a downtrend in the federal funds rate, said a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION>, speaking anonymously. The federal funds rate, the rate charged by a bank that loans excess reserves to another bank overnight, is considered a sensitive indicator of monetary conditions. Falling interest rates in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tend to lower the dollar's value The Bank of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> trader said, however, that the dollar should go up as participants bought back the currency to cover their short dollar positions. Investors also were awaiting the release of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wholesale price index for September later Friday to see if it would bring any relaxation in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> monetary policy. Because the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION>'s discount rate hike Wednesday by 0.5 percentage point to 3.75 percent and its massive dollar-selling intervention has not been very successful in stemming the dollar's continuting rise, a discount rate cut by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> would be expected to add stability in currency movements, he said The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 242.52 points, or 0.70 percent, to move to 35,037.86 shortly after the morning session started. On Thursday, the index shed 444.73 points, the second-largest one-day loss, ending at 34,795.34. Dealers said the index rebounded sharply as market players picked up issues whose prices plunged the previous day, while traders also were reassured by the yen's overnight recovery.

<HEAD>Italian Bank Files Federal Suit Against Two Former Officers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Banca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nazionale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> del </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lavoro </ORGANIZATION> filed a suit in federal court Thursday that charges two former officers of the Italian bank's <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> office with making unauthorized credits to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The suit, filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, accuses <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Drogoul </PERSON>, former manager of the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> office, and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Wedel </PERSON>, a suspended vice president at the office, of concealing the transactions and causing the bank several million dollars in losses. <ORGANIZATION> BNL </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s largest bank, said in the suit that the actual amount of the losses has not been determined, though bank officials previously said more than $ 1.7 billion worth of unauthorized transactions were made. The suit does not seek specific damages. The suit also says others were involved in the alleged scheme, though it does not identify additional participants. The suit says the alleged activities include racketeering, mail fraud and wire fraud. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, an attorney for <PERSON> Drogoul </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Von </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wedel </ORGANIZATION>, said late Thursday afternoon he had not yet seen the suit but was aware it had been filed. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> would not respond to specific charges in the suit but denied that any actions by the two men caused the bank to lose money. `` I understand they have charged <PERSON> Drogoul </PERSON> and <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Wedel </PERSON> with unauthorized transactions that have caused the bank a loss,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. `` Our side is, whatever happened did not harm the bank.'' He said he would file a response to the suit within 20 days. <ORGANIZATION> BNL </ORGANIZATION> announced in August it had uncovered transactions by its <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> branch that were neither authorized by the bank's North American management nor its <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> headquarters. The developing scandal has caused shock waves both in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, where the bank is 74 percent owned by the national treasury. <PERSON> Drogoul </PERSON> was fired in early September, and nine of the 15 employees in the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> office later were suspended. In <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, the government replaced the two top officials of <ORGANIZATION> BNL </ORGANIZATION> after word of the investigation broke. The suit says the time the alleged activities began has not been determined. <PERSON> Drogoul </PERSON> and <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Wedel </PERSON> began working for <ORGANIZATION> BNL </ORGANIZATION> in 1984. The suit alleges that the unauthorized credits and loan agreements were made to various commercial banks in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iraq </ORGANIZATION> and facilities in other countries including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` The loan agreements and credit facilities purported to obligate <ORGANIZATION> BNL </ORGANIZATION> to extend credit ... at interest rates, fees and other compensation below the prevailing market rates fore such loans,'' the suit said. The defendants `` engaged in a conscious, deliberate and widespread effort to conceal the existence of the agreements and facilities and the actions'' to bank officials as well as regulatory agencies, according to the suit. By doing so, the suit said, the two men violated their duties as officials of the bank and caused the institution harm that will continue into the foreseeable future.
