<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Polk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> is making its own crack these days, having decided it is a safer and more efficient way to supply its undercover agents for sales to drug buyers. While most law enforcement agencies use crack confiscated during investigations for undercover operations, <LOCATION> Polk </LOCATION> officials decided they needed more than the `` very limited supply'' of crack they had on hand, a department report said. In addition, there were worries about impurities sometimes found in confiscated crack. Turning powder cocaine into crack cocaine requires a powdery base substance as well as the drug. Some dealers have been known to use Drano or other toxic chemicals as the base, sheriff's Lt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Madden </PERSON> said recently. `` After reviewing all our options and checking with other agencies in the state that are taking an aggressive approach to crack, we felt the safest and most reliable way to handle these reverses would be use crack that was produced in a clean, controlled environment,'' the report said. <LOCATION> Polk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> deputies posing as drug dealers have routinely set up shop in known drug neighborhoods and sold crack to drug buyers in cars. Deputies have made more than 600 reverse-sting arrests since the campaign began in earnest last fall. The Sheriff's Office crack was made at the department by a supervisor in the drug unit who had gone over the fairly simple cooking procedure with technicians from the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION>. Baking powder was used as a base substance. The cooking session produced 11 ounces, enough to make several thousand pieces of crack in the size commonly sold on the street, officials said.

 From a distance, there's no telling sign that the noisy children and teen-agers romping around a summer camp share the deep emotional and physical scars that accompany disfiguring burns. `` We try to give them a whole week to be free of their burn,'' said <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, who heads the special camp. It's called <LOCATION> Wonder </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ranch </LOCATION>, this secluded spot nestled in the <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> 200 miles southeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. This week 77 young burn survivors from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state frolicked in a swimming pool, rode ponies or cast a fishing line into a trout pond. `` If my mom would n't have taken me, I would have walked here,'' declared <PERSON> David </PERSON>, an 11-year-old enjoying the camp sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Alisa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ann </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ruch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. `` The counselors are real cool. They treat you really nice.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, the foundation's executive director, described the camp as therapy to help fortify a burn victim's self-esteem. Most important, it lets them simply be kids free from a society too often repelled by the disfigurement of burns. There is one strict rule: No one can ask the children about their accident. `` That's why camp is so good for them _ they do n't have to deal with the accident,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>. `` We do n't want them reliving that.'' The children splashing in the pool on a hot summer morning played as if they never had endured painful skin grafts, worn an uncomfortable pressure garment to reduce swelling or been cruelly teased by peers. As <PERSON> Corky </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cecily </PERSON> splashed around, <PERSON> Corky </PERSON> stretched her scarred arm around <PERSON> Cecily </PERSON>'s back, proclaiming with a wide smile: `` We're friends. Mrs. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>'s husband, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> firefighter and foundation member, said there's little reluctance among these summer campers to test new experiences. `` They've been through so much pain, they'll try anything,'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said. The camp is rewarding for the volunteer counselors, mostly firefighters and their spouses. `` If you come up here for a week, you get enough hugs and kisses to last a year,'' said <PERSON> Nan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziegler </PERSON>, a nurse from <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. `` I love them. They are just little kids. They can forget what they look like,'' said <PERSON> Christen </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, a lifeguard from <LOCATION> Clovis </LOCATION>. `` I'm going to miss these kids.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said such a loving and accepting environment is n't typical for burn survivors Society is wary of burn victims, she said. Some gawk at a survivor's blistered and grafted skin, while others treat them like pariahs. She told of an incident of a restaurant owner asking a family to leave because the sight of their child, a burn victim, made his patrons uncomfortable. These experiences, along with the fact that many burn victims remain physically scarred for life, add up to a `` devastating'' psychological effect on the victims and their families, Mrs. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said. Easing such trauma is one of the foundation's goals. `` Now that -LRB- doctors -RRB- have solved the major medical problems and are able to keep them alive, they are now concentrating on the quality of life,'' she said. She estimated that 4,000 children are seriously burned in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> each year. All expenses for the children at the camp are paid by the foundation's fund-raising efforts and volunteer labor. Mrs. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> estimated that the week in <LOCATION> Wonder </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, which ends with a trip to <LOCATION> Disneyland </LOCATION>, cost the group about $ 100,000. Judging by the the children's grins, it appeared to be money well spent. `` Today and this week they are just kids,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>. She said she hopes the camp will help make them `` strong enough inside to take and handle the pressures their peers and adults give them.''

<TEXT>
 Author <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> knows that the quick grip of fear and split-second decisions that can make or break a cop's career are not just the stuff of police fiction. A former deputy commissioner of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> has grabbed the attention of readers on subjects ranging from treasure diving in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to bullfighting in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, but is best known for his insider's tales of street crime and police bureaucracy. During an interview at the converted cottage on his <LOCATION> Ridgefield </LOCATION> estate where he does his writing, the best-selling author of `` Year of a Dragon,'' `` Hands of a Stranger'' and `` Prince of the City,'' explained how fact and fantasy merge in his latest novel, `` Man With a Gun'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Schuster, $ 19.95 -RRB-. `` Most of the incidents happened to me one way or the other, but they did n't happen just that way,'' <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> said. `` All of them have been extracted from the way they actually happened and moved together to make a story.'' The story of `` Man With a Gun'' is loosely based on events surrounding the <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mosque </LOCATION> murder of 1972, when a police officer was killed during a confrontation between black Muslims and authorities. The book deals with the power and politics behind the police handling of a situation where every decision has long-term consequences. `` In moments of terror you do what it seems like you have to do and no one is responsible for that,'' <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> said. `` I made some mistakes which did n't seem like mistakes at the time,'' he said of his involvement in the Mosque riots. <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> and the central character in `` Man With a Gun,'' <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> Keefe </PERSON>, are alike in many ways. <PERSON> Keefe </PERSON> is a deputy police commissioner and, like <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, resigns after the incident. <PERSON> Keefe </PERSON> is a former journalist. <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> worked for five years as a foreign correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Keefe </PERSON> drives a <ORGANIZATION> Porsche </ORGANIZATION>; so does <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>. However, <PERSON> Keefe </PERSON> is not <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, the author insists. `` I have no ghosts to exorcise.'' For one thing, <PERSON> Keefe </PERSON> is not a successful author. <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> has 20 books to his credit. Five novels have been made into films, and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> is slated to play the lead role in `` Man With a Gun.'' In his novels, the 57-year-old <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> aims to provide more than a mirror image of life. Literature should provide `` new insights into your own life, into everybody's life, a new understanding of what we are all up against,'' he said. Novels about the police, however, tend to be grouped together as thrillers, said <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, who considers thrillers to be books with `` preposterous characters doing preposterous acts all the time.'' `` Thriller means discardable, thriller means light entertainment, thriller means not important,'' he said. `` The word denigrates what I am trying to do. I think I am writing something else and keep getting accused of writing thrillers.'' As an undergraduate studying literature at <ORGANIZATION> Fordham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> said he wanted to be the greatest writer that ever lived. He has since lowered his goal to writing books that will stand the test of time. Translations of <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>'s books cram his closets. `` I ca n't throw them away because they are books and books are icons.'' Samples of his photographic work decorate his walls. <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> bought a camera when <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> offered to pay him $ 15 extra for every photograph used in the newspaper. His photographs have since been exhibited at the <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gallery of Modern Art. But he prefers writing. `` To me literature is the greatest of the arts because it takes you further outside yourself than any other,'' he said, adding there's also a practical side to his work. `` I do n't want to be poor. I would n't give up the things we have in order to be a renowned writer that no one ever reads.'' He keeps apartments in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, as well as his <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> home where he lives with his wife. Currently working on a `` part personal memoir, part history of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> said he considers the time spent writing the book as a rest period from the pressures of producing what is expected of him. `` I have to write something that's going to sell,'' he said. `` -LRB- You -RRB- get trapped in whatever it is that you are doing that's successful.

 A <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> judge has prohibited a private television station from broadcasting a colorized version of `` Asphalt Jungle,'' a classic <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Huston </PERSON> film. The ruling Friday was the first of its kind in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> has its arms scandals, but the kind that has shaken <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is unlikely because procurement programs are run differently and governments generally avoid direct competition among contractors. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a 2-year-old investigation has focused on allegations that private consultants bribed government employees to obtain <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> secrets that could help their clients win huge contracts. Proportion alone is a significant factor in the relative opportunity for corruption. Nothing in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> even approaches the colossus of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense budget, $ 290 billion for 1988. <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> _ respective recent budgets of about $ 4 billion and $ 2.8 billion _ have had scandals recently, but they involved bribery and illegal exports. Both Scandinavian are considering measures to control their arms traders. Even <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> spend only one-tenth the amount of money on defense that goes through the Pentagon funnel every year. The giant <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marconi </ORGANIZATION> communications group currently is the object of a year-long fraud investigation, but defense scandals in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> seldom are publicized. The Marconi case is based on suspicions that the company made excessive profits and did not pay royalties it owed the government. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> had a major bribery scandal a decade ago in which a former defense minister and an air force chief were convicted of accepting payoffs from <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aircraft manufacturer. In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> was accused of taking millions from from <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> when he was defense minister in 1961, but the case was dropped. `` The Europeans deal with these things differently. They do n't want to know about them,'' said <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Karp </PERSON>, an American who tracks worldwide weapons sales for <ORGANIZATION> SIPRI </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Stockholm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> `` All over <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> the procurement networks are much smaller than in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' he said. `` There are real old-boy networks here. ... The Europeans are very hesitant to prosecute people on the team.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON> said <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> governments seldom use middlemen on contracts and most weapons come from `` preferred sources'' that coordinate development programs with defense ministries. <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON>, a professor at <ORGANIZATION> Aberdeen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, said in an interview that <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> governments and companies have `` almost a symbiotic relationship'' and few secrets from each other. Lack of competition sometimes bloats prices. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s Guardian newspaper said recently <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has complained to the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> for years about `` unsatisfactory administration'' and a `` disturbing failure'' to control costs. <PERSON> Karp </PERSON> said corruption is hard to pin down in European procurements, but some armaments in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> are three or four times the price of comparable <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> weapons systems. `` Europeans expect to pay more and they accept that. It's the price they pay to keep their independence from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said. According to <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON>, `` The key difference with the Americans is that in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> until recently you did n't have consultants, the ` Beltway Bandits,' or people who are hungry for contracts.'' <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> controls 15 percent of the national arms production and the government has a share in companies that handle about half the rest, a ministry spokesman said. Supervision of arms sales in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is handled by government agencies, sometimes by parliaments. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> has no oversight process, said a spokesman for the prime minister's office. When corruption occurs in the European arms trade, it usually involves export sales, especially to Third World countries. <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AB </ORGANIZATION>, the privately owned Swedish munitions company, is accused of paying $ 50 million in bribes and commissions to get a $ 2.4 billion artillery contract from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. Some of the money allegedly found its way to Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, spawning charges in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> of government corruption. For deals in many parts of the world, bribery payments are incorporated in to the prices of weapons, two sources said privately. One, a retired Swedish salesman of defense equipment, said of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>: `` It was taken for granted that you ca n't secure an arms deal without bribes.'' <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION>, the largest arms maker in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, also is accused of circumventing rules against selling weapons to nations that are at war or located in volatile regions. The rules are meant to safeguard Swedish neutrality. Four former <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION> executives were indicted this week on charges of smuggling anti-aircraft missile systems to <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> are at war. None was accused of profiting personally. Prime Minister <PERSON> Ingvar </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON> threatened to halt all arms exports unless the companies follow the regulations. <PERSON> Kongsberg </PERSON> <PERSON> Vapenfabrikk </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s largest defense contractor, admitted violating Western export controls by selling equipment to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> that would enable it to built quieter submarines. The deal, revealed last year, led to a public apology from Prime Minister <PERSON> Gro </PERSON> <PERSON> Harlem </PERSON> <PERSON> Brundtland </PERSON> to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>.

 Floods and landslides caused by more than a week of heavy rains have killed 62 people in two provinces in eastern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, official reports said today. Six of the victims were children killed when a waterlogged school building collapsed in <LOCATION> Zhejiang </LOCATION> province's <LOCATION> Longquan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, the official <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> reported. Heavy rains also fell this week in <LOCATION> Jiangxi </LOCATION> province on <LOCATION> Zhejiang </LOCATION>'s western border, causing a landslide that killed at least 17 people, the paper said. Reports today did not specify where or how the other 39 people died. The <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said 212,420 acres of farmland have been flooded and nearly 6,400 homes destroyed in <LOCATION> Zhejiang </LOCATION> since the rains began June 15. The rains in <LOCATION> Jiangxi </LOCATION> have flooded 568,000 acres of farmland and forced 14,000 people to flee their homes, the <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Daily said. The report said four to 12 inches of rain fell on various parts of <LOCATION> Zhejiang </LOCATION> during a 10-day period ending Friday. <LOCATION> Zhejiang </LOCATION> normally receives about four inches of rain during the entire month of June. In <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the rainy season generally lasts until mid-July and more storms are forecast.

 Before glasnost, School No. 734 would have looked like this: 17-year-olds lined up in the hall in the summer heat, nervously awaiting a grilling on Soviet politics and history by a panel of teachers. That's what lanky, blond-haired <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> Predkov </PERSON> and his classmates at the school in eastern <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> had been expecting Friday. But last month, the head of Soviet education, <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yagodin </PERSON>, suddenly ordered the tests canceled. The reason: The final exams would have made students in the final year of school parrot material in textbooks now contradicted by the revelations of <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s drive for more openness in history and other areas. Instead, <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> and his 24 classmates, like 10th graders nationwide, were called into school for a three-hour ungraded `` discussion'' to gauge their knowledge of the past and awareness of problems facing the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> today. `` We want to be sure that the children can take part in discussions and are able to to voice their opinion anywhere,'' said their teacher, <PERSON> Vera </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zorich </PERSON>, 53. Despite that wish, most of the teen-age Muscovites who gathered at 9 a.m. Friday around four tables in a geography classroom said nothing during the ensuing `` discussion,'' despite repeated prompting from teachers. Some, however, aired views at odds with official ideology, and that presumably would have gotten them into trouble only a few years ago. One even joked about the Russian Revolution. <PERSON> Predkov </PERSON> stood up to say that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s program for `` perestroika,'' or economic and social restructuring, was not a natural consequence of the growth of Soviet socialism, and that people who say otherwise do so `` only because <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is the head of our party.'' `` We do n't have any rights. They're just words on paper,'' declared the son of a building engineer. Glasnost, <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> added, may allow more candor about history, but it does n't mean Soviet citizens are getting more information about current political problems. Another 17-year-old, wearing a thin black tie, said Soviets of all schools of thought, even `` fascists,'' should have the legal right to form their own political parties to challenge the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> heads. <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaztman </PERSON>, whose father works as a printer, made his classmates and teachers roar with laughter by telling this bittersweet joke about the legacy of the 1917 Russian Revolution: When the <ORGANIZATION> Bolsheviks </ORGANIZATION> seized power, <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> said, a <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> countess whose grandfather had been a 19th-century revolutionary summoned her maid to see what the shouting in the streets was about. `` Why, Madame, it's the revolution,'' the maid replied. `` Oh yes, grandfather dreamed of that. Tell me, what do they want?'' the countess asked. `` Why, they want a society where there are no more rich people.'' `` Strange,'' the countess replied. `` Grandfather wanted a society where there were no more poor people.'' `` Four years ago, maybe even a year ago, they would not have dared speak like that,'' a beaming Mrs. <PERSON> Zorich </PERSON> told a visiting reporter at the end of the meeting. In recent months, Soviet educators and official media have heaped scorn on the country's history textbooks, which have been outpaced by criticism in the glasnost-revitalized media about the crimes of dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> and corruption and stagnation under <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>. `` Frankly, the books are of the ` hooray' type,'' said <PERSON> Tatyana </PERSON> <PERSON> Cherkashena </PERSON>, head of teaching methods in the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> neighborhood where School No. 734 is located. `` In our country, they say, everything is wonderful _ ` hooray.' Those who perished in the repressions, those who were imprisoned, are not even mentioned.'' A recent competition was held to select a new generation of Soviet textbooks, but it is uncertain whether they will be ready for the next school year in September. In the meantime, many Soviet teachers have been using articles published in the press as the basis for their history lessons. In years past, 10th grade students taking their final exams were given a slip of paper that bore two questions on history and civics. After a half-hour or more to prepare, they were called before a panel of teachers to speak and answer questions. In May, the principal of School 734, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tubelsky </PERSON>, was informed by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> that the customary year-end history exams for senior school pupils had been canceled. `` We were n't told about how to structure the discussions, so we decided to use the regular form of our history class, which the students would feel comfortable with,'' <PERSON> Tubelsky </PERSON> said. `` We need to change out textbooks,'' he added. `` They are based on a Stalinist conception that sees every event, every historical figure, through the dogma of class warfare.''

 These days, this <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> enclave is a magnet for peace marchers, <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks, <LOCATION> Nigerian </LOCATION> `` drummers of passion,'' victims of <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION>, poets and blues singers of the nuclear age. All have converged on the Third Special Session on Disarmament, a monthlong gathering ending this week. They have camped on the sidewalks and exploded 1,000 balloons to symbolize nuclear tests. They have gathered at a corner coffee shop to discuss radioactive military landfills, the evils of transnational corporations, and the future of the Siberian crane. They range from a 12-year-old <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> girl who invented a peace game to <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON>, the 77-year-old Nobel laureate. But all the spinning of prayer wheels, scattering of flower petals, chanting of mantras, and meditation on brotherhood have not harmonized discordant views on disarmament. The 159 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> members are trying to devise a realistic agenda for peace, and delegates hope they'll be able to adopt a final document by concensus, without divisive voting that usually pits the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> against most of the developing world and socialist countries. The superpower backdrop is positive: the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit, the Soviet pullout from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, and the treaty on elimination of intermediate-range nuclear weapons. But differences over such issues as nuclear and conventional disarmament and a nuclear test ban treaty are enormous. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has made clear it will not reaffirm what it calls a sweeping and unrealistic <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> disarmament document adopted 10 years ago. Last year, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> voted alone on most disarmament issues in the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, ranging from a demand for a comprehensive nuclear test ban to prohibiting the military uses of outer space. It refused to participate in a conference on the relationship between disarmament and development. Third World nations have been clamoring for a disarmament fund of military savings in the industrialized world to be diverted toward economic and social development in poor countries. Western diplomats say that the developing world should do its part by halting its regional wars and curbing its massive spending on conventional arms _ spending that deprives people of food, health care and education. The American positions have not changed in the current disarmament session. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration and Western allies emphasize the importance of bilateral negotiations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in nuclear and other fields and do not want bilateral talks subject to multilateral pressures. `` We are hearing a lot of cant,'' said one Western diplomat. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and the Soviets are doing just fine. What we need is a realistic approach that will leave nations free to pursue their bilateral actions without multilateral interference.'' At this session, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is a major player and is seen, far more than the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, as a team player in the world body. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has been calling for a larger and more powerful role for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in multilateral arms negotiations, disarmament verification and monitoring, expanded peacekeeping operations and crisis management. It has called for a new <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> naval peacekeeping force and <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> space agency. But the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, more than $ 400 million in arrears in <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> dues, does n't want to see expanded <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> operations infringe on traditional areas of national prerogative. <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, the Soviet foreign minister, unfurled a sweeping blueprint of disarmament proposals and in a grand gesture, invited the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general, <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and nonaligned leaders to attend the first Soviet destruction of intermediate-range nuclear missiles. `` The first and perhaps the hardest thing to do,'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said, `` is to abandon the myth of nuclear weapons as the guarantor of peace ... We are convinced that ensuring security by non-nuclear means is possible.'' The speech initially was praised by <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> as constructive and deserving of study. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have not responded to specific proposals, such as a permanent moratorium on nuclear testing, slashing conventional armies in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> by 500,000 soldiers each, and announcement of port calls by warships with or without nuclear arms. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> outlined the standard <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> positions. He emphasized the dangers of proliferation in nuclear, conventional, ballistic, chemical and other weapons and cited the dangers of the Iran-Iraq war and the rivalry between <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. He did not mention the Soviet proposals. British Foreign Secretary Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> sounded the theme of nuclear deterrence _ considered anathema to most <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> delegates. `` It may be that one day we shall find a better way to prevent war than through nuclear deterrence,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. `` But to suggest that between East and West such an alternative is within reach is to deny reality.'' Meanwhile, 12-year-old <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Robyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, was promoting her game, `` Give Peace a Chance,'' and saying her dream was to play it with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. She said she still was waiting for a White House response.

 Unaccredited workers botched asbestos removal at a high school and exposed students to cancer-causing fibers, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> charged Friday in its first enforcement of new regulations. The agency, which proposed a $ 5,000 fine, said 6,400 square feet of asbestos-containing floor tiles were improperly removed in February from a hallway at <ORGANIZATION> Thornton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Township </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>. Workers who were not accredited by the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> `` had sanded, chipped and cut the tiles, releasing clouds of dust containing asbestos,'' the agency said in a statement. The district overseeing the school in southwest suburban <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> failed to `` post signs and restrict the affected area to only those persons necessary to do tile removal and cleanup,'' the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said. School officials have until July 11 to respond to the complaint.

The school was closed Friday afternoon and officials could not be reached for comment. Ms. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said school officials did not know the tiles contained asbestos when the removal began, but suspected they might and ordered tests. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> called the complaint its first enforcement action nationwide under last year's Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act, which specifies procedures for removing asbestos in public and private elementary and secondary schools.

 Two years of turmoil has taken a physical toll of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s lawmakers, who had to deal with the governor's time-consuming impeachment trial and face raising taxes $ 200 million just months before re-election bids Their current session set a record Friday as the longest in state history and they're far from finished with their business. `` I do n't think there's a member here who's not among the walking wounded,'' said House Minority Leader <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> Democrat. `` I'm just exhausted,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Usdane </PERSON>, a Republican from <LOCATION> Scottsdale </LOCATION>. `` It does n't feel good,'' said House Speaker <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>. Friday was the 166th day of the session, but taxes, budgets, and about 50 other pieces of legislation are still not settled. And the lawmakers are operating on reduced pay, increased fatigue and, in some cases, worse health. In theory, legislative sessions are supposed to end by the Saturday of the week in which the 100th day falls. But the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> impeachment and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> trial of Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> took weeks out of each chamber's schedule this year. And the trauma started last year, when <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> faced off against a largely inexperienced set of legislative leaders. The stage was set in 1986, when then-Gov. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> decided to run for president, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> decided to run for governor, Speaker <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sossaman </PERSON> ran for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Turley </PERSON> and Minority Leader <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON> retired. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> beat <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> in a rough Republican primary election and clashed repeatedly with the Republican-controlled legislature, until this year when the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> ousted him on April 4. Now, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> loyalists are vowing revenge at the polls and Democrats are drooling at the prospect of increased numbers in both chambers. Many Republican incumbents simply are n't running for re-election, and others, such as <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, face uphill election fights _ if they find the time to gather signatures on their nominating petitions before the June 30 deadline. Among the casualties: _ <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Runyan </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s majority whip, suffered a stroke while undergoing an operation and is confined to a wheelchair. He comes in only for key votes and will not seek re-election. _ <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Lunn </PERSON>, touted as one of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>'s rising young stars, aggravated a pre-ulcerous condition and has decided to run for county supervisor instead of re-election. _ <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratliff </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> majority leader, suffered a heart attack and is retiring. _ Sterling Ridge, a <LOCATION> Glendale </LOCATION> Republican, also is retiring, citing health reasons. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, in his 16th year as a representative, said it was a very stressful session. `` It is the cumulative effect of the <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> administration and the kind of meanness that was there _ all of this madness.'' <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democratic leader <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> say <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leaders bear some of the blame for allowing the session to continue drifting along. `` We've been putting things off and putting things off and putting things off,'' said <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON>, who estimated that 75 bills were languishing without debate while lawmakers cool their heels. `` To paraphrase <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON>, ` Never have so many worked for so long for so little,''' <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said Thursday after <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> staged his second walkout of the week, spiking a tentative tax agreement. Other than <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s impeachment, lawmakers faced three major issues this year: air quality, indigent health care, and a state budget of about $ 3 billion. An air-quality bill is on the governor's desk, but there's no agreement on indigent health or budgets. Lawmakers draw salaries of $ 15,000 a year and extended their regular expense pay for 30 days beyond the normal 120-day limit, but since then they have been operating on reduced pay of $ 10 a day for Phoenix-area lawmakers and $ 20 a day for those from outside <LOCATION> Maricopa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Some grouchiness is a standard feature at every end-of-session crunch as lawmakers confront issues they avoided at first. But between the <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> trial's unheeled scars and the prospect of election fights ahead, lawmakers, lobbyists and others say things seem worse than usual. `` It just is n't as much fun,'' said <PERSON> Lunn </PERSON>. The previous record, 165 days, was set in 1976.

 Authorities in the Soviet republic of <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION> have bowed to public pressure and decided to halt two controversial irrigation projects that would have damaged a vast inland lake, <ORGANIZATION> TASS </ORGANIZATION> reported. The official news agency said Friday that the projects were halted because studies showed they would cause the water level of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Balkhash </LOCATION> to drop sharply. The lake, located in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, covers 320 square miles. <ORGANIZATION> TASS </ORGANIZATION> said the decision was preceded by a campaign of letters and articles in <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>'s state-run media against the scheme. The lake in eastern <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION> helps modify the dry, scorching climate of the area, home to about 2.5 million people, <ORGANIZATION> TASS </ORGANIZATION> said.

 They could have been cremation pits, cock-fighting rings, animal pens, Civil War foxholes or secret hiding places for moonshine equipment. Maybe they were prehistoric Indian burial sites, charcoal pits or foundations for native American abodes. Or maybe, some say, the stone circles dotting the western slope of Polish Mountain encircled apple trees in the early 1900s. For more than a decade, 150 to 200 circles of sandstone rock have puzzled area residents and archaelogists. Virtually hidden by brush and poison ivy, the gray-colored rocks of various shapes and sizes are neatly arranged in circles. No one knows their purpose, or who put them there. `` Everybody that goes up there has some kind of weird theory,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mash </PERSON>, manager of <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION>, where the circles are found. `` One guy even mentioned that they could have been sweat lodges _ like a Turkish bath. `` The Indians would have these rituals when they would go into manhood,'' he said. `` They would go in these buildings with hot rocks and put water on them _ something like a sauna.'' But 150 to 200 saunas on one hillside in western <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>? <PERSON> Mash </PERSON> said rangers noticed the stone rings in the early 1970s. In 1975, <PERSON> Mash </PERSON> contacted State Archaeologist <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bastian </PERSON>, who visited the site and put the circles on a list of archaeological areas in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. But it was not until last year that some archaelogists and volunteers excavated one of the circles. `` They did the dig and found zip, except for the rattlesnakes,'' <PERSON> Mash </PERSON> said. Hoping to uncover clues, another group conducted a dig this spring. `` In a nutshell, we did n't discover anything. They still remain a mystery,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> McVeigh </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archaeological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. `` We dug out in the center of them. We did n't go down very far before we got to bedrock. We found no artifacts. We found nothing to indicate prehistoric use.'' No future digs are planned, and two local archaeologists who took an interest in the circles, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> and <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Huddleston </PERSON>, both have moved from <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. Neither could be reached for comment recently. Meanwhile, the state forest has put the circles on its historic preservation list to ensure the five-acre tract remains untouched, <PERSON> Mash </PERSON> said. The site could be eligible for the National Register of Historic Places if additional information could be found to document the age of the rings, their use and significance. <PERSON> Mash </PERSON> has dismissed the moonshine theory because there is no nearby water source needed to make moonshine. He said he did not think they were cock-fighting rings because only one pit is needed to hold a fight. And the rings are too close together to have been foxholes during the Civil War, he said. `` The site has no strategic value,'' <PERSON> Mash </PERSON> said. `` -LRB- And -RRB- the guy in the middle foxhole is going to be shooting his own pals before he can get his bullet out to hit the bad guys.'' Until someone conjures up a more believable theory, <PERSON> Mash </PERSON> said he puts the most stock in the orchard theory _ that someone placed the stones around apple trees that once grew in the area. There were 1 million apple trees in <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION> by 1914, he said. `` It is possible that they hired immigrants who could not understand directions given in English and some of them were told to clear the rocks away to plant the apple trees,'' he suggested. `` They were new in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and wanted to do a nice, neat job, so they put these rocks in nice neat little circles and left a space in the middle for the tree. And they might have worked on these for a couple of days, or a week until somebody stopped them. That could be a theory ...''

 Two Cambodian immigrants were jailed after police discovered a partially skinned puppy with its throat slit lying in a pool of blood on the men's kitchen floor, officials said. Neighbors who heard the puppy's whining as it was allegedly being beaten to death called officers Thursday night to an apartment in a predominantly <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> neighborhood, said police Sgt. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON>. <PERSON> Caea </PERSON> <PERSON> Sokheng </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ou </PERSON> <PERSON> Seng </PERSON> <PERSON> K </PERSON>, both 32, were arrested and booked for investigation of felony cruelty to animals, <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON> said. `` Well, our guys found the dead dog in the kitchen so you can draw your own conclusions,'' the sergeant said. Investigators estimated the dead puppy was 4 months old. Another puppy of similar age was rescued unharmed from the apartment, <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON> said. Both men denied ownership of the dead dog, he said.

 Pop singer <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> will undergo surgery next week to remove a cyst from his vocal cords, forcing him to cancel the rest of his scheduled performances in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, a spokesman says.

<TEXT>
 High atop the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> building a statue of <LOCATION> Ceres </LOCATION>, the Roman goddess of grain, stared unflinchingly into the searing, cloudless sky. If anybody was praying to her for rain, she had n't heard them. Besides, the whispered plea of an <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> corn farmer would n't stand a chance against the din from the floor of the world's oldest and largest grain exchange, where bushels of grain are traded in millions and blessings are counted in dollars The <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>'s grain floor, abandoned by many traders when prices and trading activity slumped in the mid-1980s, is filled these days with people looking to profit from the Midwestern drought. As the drought withers crops across the Farm Belt, it ignites big rallies on commodity exchanges, where contracts for future delivery of grain grow more precious by the day. `` This is the only place I could think of where I can make a lot of money in a fairly short period of time,'' said <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitacre </PERSON>, 21, an entry-level employee of a large investment firm who dreams of owning his own seat on the exchange. <PERSON> Whitacre </PERSON>'s job is to stand just outside the apparent chaos of the jam-packed corn futures pit and report to his boss on the moves of the market's major players. He has put his college education on hold for this opportunity, which was created by the dramatic rise in trading activity accompanying the drought-driven jump in prices. `` If you start out working at a corporation it takes years to work your way up to the top,'' <PERSON> Whitacre </PERSON> said. `` But you come down here, after a couple of years you buy a seat, and you can be making a lot of money.'' How much? `` Your imagination's the only limit.'' <PERSON> Whitacre </PERSON> is n't the only one lured to the Board of Trade by one of the biggest grain rallies in the exchange's 140-year history. The population of the grain trading floor has swelled more than 40 percent to nearly 2,000 in just the past two months, according to exchange figures. About half of those people are traders. Their job is to face each other on the steps of circular pits and use a combination of hand signals and shouted bids to strike deals for deliveries of grain and soybeans in 5,000-bushel lots. Big trading companies such as <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and C & amp; D Commodities frequently trade thousands of contracts, totaling millions of bushels, during a session. Perhaps a third of the traders are independents, called `` locals'' or `` scalpers,'' who trade for their own accounts and drift from pit to pit in search of action. When grain trading slowed after the volatile, dry-weather period of late 1983 and early 1984, many locals moved to the exchange's financial-futures room to bet on the performance of stocks and bonds. Because of its boisterous nature, trading in the pits is usually perceived as a young person's game. But among the recent returnees to the grain room are a good number of silver-haired veterans, some of whom say their experience gives them an edge. `` I can tell what's going on standing here with a blindfold on,'' said 74-year-old <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> chairman, as he surveyed the scene from the sidelines while waiting for the right moment to strike. `` I can tell whether the markets are going up or down by the sound.'' Although this is the fifth significant dry-weather boom the grain markets have seen since the record-setting rally of 1973, the timing and severity of this drought makes it unique, traders said. `` Nobody here has ever really traded -LRB- on -RRB- the fear of a real potential disaster,'' said one trader who asked not to be identified. `` That's what makes this market different from any other time in history.'' Independent traders resent the perception that they seek to profit from the nation's misfortune, a view that inspired a recent <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> editorial cartoon depicting commodity traders as vultures descending on a drought-stricken farmer. `` When the traders start to make a little money, some people begrudge it to us but they do n't realize we've had a severely depressed business here the last four years,'' said <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorman </PERSON>, an independent grain trader who also runs a small trading company. `` We feel very badly that the farmers are hurt but we ca n't do anything about that,'' <PERSON> Dorman </PERSON> said. `` We just follow the market, we do n't make the market.''

<TEXT>
 Ambulance operators say <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> may have done an inadequate job of repairing up to 14,500 fire-prone ambulances, and they are calling for an investigation by federal transportation officials. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> counters that its recall work on the ambulances has been more than adequate and that some ambulance operators have been slow to bring in the vehicles for repairs. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ambulance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a Washington-based organization representing private ambulance operators, said Friday in a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> that it had received reports of long delays, unavailable parts, shoddy work and added bills for fixing the ambulances. `` It would appear that a significant number of ambulances are still not fully retrofitted,'' the association wrote. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> recalled about 14,500 of the vehicles, converted to ambulances by other companies from the 1983-1987 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Econoline </ORGANIZATION> E-350 models, after reports of fuel-system problems that caused fires. The recall came in two phases, one in July 1987 for rerouting of the fuel line and a second in August 1987 for installation of further safety precautions. More than 20 fires were reported and were blamed on overpressurization of fuel tanks and lines caused by muffler heat. `` We feel -LRB- the recall -RRB- is certainly more than adequate,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Parris </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Dearborn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION> `` We're concerned with it. We do n't take it lightly at all. We do n't drag our feet. ... We've made every effort to try to get these people in here to get this recall taken care of.'' He said some 700 Ford dealers had parts available for the recall work. `` If these people will bring these vehicles in, they can have it done,'' <PERSON> Parris </PERSON> said. Eighty percent of the recalled ambulances were brought in for the first phase of work, but only 65 percent have undergone the second phase, <PERSON> Parris </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> has 120 days to respond to the ambulance association's petition

 Representatives from eight <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> churches say <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s army stopped them from delivering food, medicine and fertilizer to resettled refugees in northern <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Eight representatives of <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Area </LOCATION> churches and synagogues told a news conference Friday that the <ORGANIZATION> 4th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION> blocked their three-truck convoy on June 16.

The supplies, which were bound for the towns of <LOCATION> Guarjila </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ranchos </LOCATION>, were left in a convent in the town while efforts to deliver them continued, the church workers said. Leftist guerrillas battling the U.S.-backed government of President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> maintain a strong military and political presence in much of <LOCATION> Chalatenango </LOCATION> province. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> McFalls </PERSON>, a member of the church group and a student at the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Religion </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said the delegation had obtained permission to deliver the supplies from military officials in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> before leaving for the region. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ranchos </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guarjila </LOCATION> were evacuated in the early 1980s because of heavy fighting in the civil war. The towns were resettled last fall under the auspices of the non-governmental <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> for Repopulation. They now have a combined population of about 1,800. Over the past year the armed forces have allowed some relief shipments to reach their destinations but have held up others.

<HEAD>Pentagon Relaxes Some Spending Limits After Cost-Cutting Freeze</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> plans to resume offering contracts for research and consulting work next month but other restrictions on military spending will remain in effect in order to hold down costs. Deputy Defense Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> <PERSON> IV </PERSON> on Friday announced plans to relax a freeze on outside contracting for supplies and services starting July 1. The freeze had been imposed in May to limit spending in fiscal 1988, which ends on Sept. 30. <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> said Friday he would begin allowing some new contracts to be awarded for research, development and evaluation work and for consultant services on July 1. But all other restrictions remain in effect, including a ban on purchases of office supplies, an end to overtime pay and limits on civilian hiring, <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> said. Active-duty personnel and civilian employees also can forget collecting their Oct. 1 paychecks a day early just because Oct. 1 falls on a Saturday, <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> declared. The Pentagon does n't want any extra outlays before the current fiscal year ends, he wrote in a memo to <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> offices. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s No. 2 executive said he still wanted some controls on the research and consultant contracts, however, specifying that `` total obligations during any month of the fourth quarter may not exceed 75 percent of the average monthly obligations incurred to date.'' The ban on new purchases of office supplies and other equipment will continue to cover everything from magazine and newspaper subscriptions to TV sets, library materials, recreation equipment, lawnmowers and furniture, tools, paint, lumber, air conditioners and fork lifts, he said. Also still prohibited is any spending on new leases for cars, office space or computer equipment. The spending restrictions originally were promulgated by <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> to comply with a deficit-reduction compromise reached last November by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. That compromise was crafted to control government outlays _ the amount of money actually paid out during the fiscal year.

<HEAD>Dangerous Biological Agents To Be Banned From Mail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is proposing new rules to ban germs and dangerous toxins from the mail just as the military reportedly was planning to increase shipments of such materials. The regulations were announced Friday, but must go through a formal rule-making process before they take effect. The <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said it took the action because of concern `` that some customers are planning increased use of the mails for sending disease germs or hazardous toxins -LRB- etiologic agents -RRB-.'' <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON>, an activist who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trends </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, hailed the decision as a step toward avoiding a potential catastrophe. He had petitioned the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to ban such shipments. <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON> said he plans to push the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to investigate shipments of dangerous products by private carriers. Various products, including biological warfare toxins, have been mailed in the past under strict packaging and labeling rules, and postal officials say no problems have occurred. But following reports that the Army planed to expand research facilities in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON> complained that the need for increased shipments of dangerous biological products could create a hazard. Army officials have told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee that they actually ship very few parcels containing biological items, and those almost always by private, commercial carrier. The packages have been tested and are literally able to survive an aircraft or highway crash, said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dashiell </PERSON>, director of environmental and life sciences at the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. While attention has focused on shipments of germs and toxins by the military, the federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> and other medical establishments also make such shipments, officials report. `` Our experience to date seems to support the opinion, expressed by medical experts, that there is little risk associated with handling properly packaged etiologic agents,'' Postmaster General <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said in a letter to <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON>. The planned new rules would cover dangerous items, but would not affect the mailing of blood samples and other such materials being sent to laboratories for routine medical testing, the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. Postal regulations already prohibit the mailing of a variety of items, including strike-anywhere matches, explosives, fuses, many poisons, most flammable liquids and certain chemicals.

 Here are some of the latest comments from the presidential campaign trail: <PERSON> GEORGE </PERSON> <PERSON> BUSH </PERSON>, commenting on the so-called gender gap _ the indication in polls that women voters support <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> by a far highter percentage than do men: `` I am confident we can overcome this gender gap.

<HEAD>Showdown Vote Nears On Requirement For Notice Of Plant Closings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is headed for a showdown vote next week on a proposal that would require companies to give their workers advance notice of major layoffs or plant closings. Senate Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., said a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> amendment would be proposed Monday to either eliminate the 60-day notice requirement for layoffs or shorten it Democrats in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Friday overwhelmingly defeated a pair of Republican amendments to the legislation. Defeated on respective votes of 60-27 and 59-31 were amendments to make picket line violence during a labor dispute a federal crime and to exempt from the notice requirements employers who give laid-off workers 60 days of severance pay. After stalling action on the legislation for three days, <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leaders agreed Friday to allow a vote late Monday on their main attempt to derail the notice requirements. The notice provision has come before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> after being separated from a trade bill that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> vetoed last month because it contained that requirement. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> amendment would be offered on Monday by Sen. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON>, R-Kan. Mrs. <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON> has said she supports 60 days' notice in cases of plant closings but not when an employer is just laying off 50 or more workers, as the Democratic-sponsored bill requires Democratic leaders have threatened to kill to any chance of winning enactment of either the advance notice requirement or the trade bill if Mrs. <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON>'s amendment is approved. `` This is a killer amendment,'' said Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` Not only does it kill this bill but it will kill the trade I've maintained all along that the president does n't want a trade bill.'' Democrats still hope to send the plant closing measure to the White House by July 4 for an expected veto by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said Friday he anticipates final passage of the plant closings bill by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday. House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, has vowed to seek its passage in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> immediately after the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s approval.

<HEAD>Study Finds US Sanctions Cut Exports To South Africa</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A government study of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> says that nation in the past two years has suffered a $ 624 million reduction in exports of sanctioned goods to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other trading partners. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> report, presented Friday to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said exports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had been cut by about $ 417 million and that the remainder of the reduction was in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s exports of sanctioned goods to 19 other countries. `` Only in the agricultural products market was <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> able to offset losses from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions and to actually increase its total exports,'' said <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendelowitz </PERSON>, an associate director of the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>'s international division. <PERSON> Mendelowitz </PERSON> said that since the enactment of the sanctions over President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto in 1986, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> experienced sharp losses in exports of coal, iron and steel, uranium and textiles. `` I think the bottom line, in shorthand, is that sanctions are working in terms of economic impact,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel `` What we can not know is whether this will result in a policy change by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' The testimony came as the committee concluded three days of public hearings on legislation to tighten sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> by requiring a near-total trade embargo and by requiring all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies to withdraw from the country. <PERSON> Mendelowitz </PERSON> said that since 1984, 162 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies have withdrawn from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and that nine of the 150 companies remaining have announced their intention to leave. Opponents of the new sanctions have raised the possibility <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> might retaliate by cutting off exports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of a list of strategic minerals of vital importance to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry. <PERSON> Mendelowitz </PERSON> noted the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mines </ORGANIZATION> recently reported there are sufficient alternative sources of supply for manganese, chromium, palladium, titanium and vanadium but not for platinum and rhodium. The mines bureau also said that cobalt supplies would remain available from <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> if new routes for shipping it were developed to bypass South African railways and ports. Other witnesses representing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies remaining in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> opposed the legislation, contending it would cost the jobs of thousands of black South Africans and shut down the programs they have instituted changes improve the lot of their black employees.

 `` For the Love of <PERSON> Louis </PERSON>,'' the concert of <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>'s music that kicked off the JVC Jazz Festival at Carnegie Hall, provided an evening of full of high notes. One such high note came from <PERSON> Lionel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Wynton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marsalis </LOCATION> as they played in duet on vibraphone and trumpet. <PERSON> Dizzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON> gave us others as he softly improvised on `` I'm Confessin' That I Love You'' and then sang it, sounding a lot like <PERSON> Louis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> recalled that <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> once advised him: `` You got to do more singing. People like singing. And you save your -LRB- trumpet-playing -RRB- chops.'' <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> played `` You Rascal You,'' which <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Theard </PERSON> composed for <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>. Then <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> sang it, imitating <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyman </PERSON> organized the Friday night program, conducted and played piano. Master of ceremonies <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaap </PERSON> called <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> `` the most important musician of the 20th century.'' He gave particulars about <ORGANIZATION> Armstrong </ORGANIZATION>'s recordings, which were then played live on stage. The concert's first half represented the Hot Five, Hot Seven and other small groups that <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> made music with in the 1920s and'30s. <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> sang some of the songs <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bessie </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> recorded. Trumpeter <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON> <PERSON> Braff </PERSON> played a medley. Three members of <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>'s last band, clarinetist <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Muranyi </PERSON>, bassist <PERSON> Arvell </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> and pianist <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON>, joined <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, trumpeter <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> and trombonist <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Masso </PERSON> for `` Basin Street.''

A film showed <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> telling how he composed `` Someday You'll Be Sorry'' on a cold night in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandke </PERSON> soloed on that. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> soloed as <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> sang `` Mack the Knife.'' <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON>, <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, <PERSON> Marsalis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> returned for `` Ding Dong Daddy from <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> started a nostalgically played encore of the `` Memories of You,'' the first recording he ever played on, which was a <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armstrong </ORGANIZATION> date. The evening was a benefit for <ORGANIZATION> Queens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, which administers the house in <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> where <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> lived the 30 years before he died July 6, 1971, and which was willed to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Queens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> intends to turn it into a museum. The college hoped to raise $ 80,000 from the evening, which also would benefit its Armstrong archives project and music scholarships. A block of benefit tickets sold for $ 100 or $ 250, which included a dinner afterwards. Festival impresario <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Wein </PERSON> announced that <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON> <PERSON> Braff </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dizzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lionel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wynton </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsalis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> donated their appearances and other musicians rehearsed for three days for scale.

<HEAD>U.S. Forecasts Major Magnetic Storm In Wake Of Huge Solar Flares</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A major magnetic storm is expected to envelop the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> on Monday as particles spewed by giant explosions on the sun disrupt global communications, alter satellite orbits and impair electric power systems. The warning issued Friday by the federal <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, was spurred by a series of solar flares _ huge sunspot-related explosions that hurl X-ray, electrically charged particles and hot gases toward <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. One of the blasts was the largest flare since April 1984, said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>, a solar astronomer at the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>. The laboratory issued a major magnetic storm warning for Monday and a minor magnetic storm warning for Tuesday, forecaster <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Balch </PERSON> said by telephone from the lab. The flares pose no direct threat to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> life. But the magnetic storm could interfere with long-distance phone calls, electric power transmission, radio broadcasts, pipeline control systems and communications with airplanes and ships, said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Heckman </PERSON>, space environment services chief at the lab. The storm was also expected to push <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s auroras away from the poles, making the northern lights visible as far south as the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Heckman </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Proton </ORGANIZATION> radiation associated with the solar flare was expected to approach Earth today, he said. <PERSON> Heckman </PERSON> added that it should be mild and pose no radidation hazard to two Soviet cosmonauts orbiting Earth, especially if they stay inside their Mir space station. The magnetic storm also will cause `` errors in the orbits of some satellites'' because of increased drag as well as particles hitting electronic parts, <PERSON> Heckman </PERSON> said. `` It will slow them down in orbit. Some people will have trouble operating their satellites.'' It also could induce stray voltages in power transmission systems, causing temporary outages and making lights flicker, he said. The last significant magnetic storm occurred in August 1972 and disrupted communications worldwide for two days, although the one expected Monday should n't be that large, <PERSON> Heckman </PERSON> said. The warning was sent to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and other agencies whose satellites or communications could be disrupted. The Space Environment Laboratory is part of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. X-rays from the biggest flare probably disrupted communications briefly Friday, although there were no immediate reports, <PERSON> Heckman </PERSON> said. Friday's big flare started at 9:44 a.m. PDT and lasted nearly two hours, <PERSON> Blach </PERSON> said. Another, somewhat smaller one began at 9:01 a.m. and lasted 41 minutes. A much smaller flare lasting 47 minutes exploded at 2:20 p.m., forecaster <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. Two other flares were observed Thursday, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> said. `` We're expecting high levels of -LRB- sunspot and flare -RRB- activity for the next three days,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said from <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>. The sunspots and flares occurred on the west edge of the sun, and their influence on Earth will diminish as they migrate toward a part of the sun not facing the planet, he added. Magnetic storms occur about six times every 11-year sunspot cycle, while flares erupt three or four times annually during the active phase of the sunspot cycle, <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. Solar flares occur when `` the magnetic configuration of sunspots gets complicated and twisted, then they release stored energy,'' <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> said. Magnetic storms disrupt communications by altering the shape of <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s ionosphere, a layer of electrically charged particles 100 to 500 miles above the planet's surface, <PERSON> Heckman </PERSON> said. The visible portion of Friday's big flare was observed from <ORGANIZATION> Caltech </ORGANIZATION>'s solar observatory near <LOCATION> Big </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bear </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> said. It extended perhaps 200,000 miles above the sun's surface, and came from a group of about 20 sunspots, some up to three times larger than Earth, he said.

<HEAD>Gasoline Tank Farm Closed After Blasts And Fire, Two More Dead</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAM ROSSIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GUADALUPE, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Officials closed a major gasoline supply depot as two more victims of the explosions and fire there died, lifting the official number of dead to four. One company however said 13 of its workers were missing, and a newspaper accused authorities of hiding deaths. A press release from <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION>, the government oil monopoly, also said 18 people were injured, four of them seriously. The disaster began Thursday afternoon when three huge tanks filled with gasoline exploded one after another. The blasts and resulting fire with temperatures up to 5,400 degrees Fahrenheit forced about 10,000 residents of this northern industrial city to flee. Many evacuees headed home Friday, though officials said a small fire still burned at one tank. It was the second explosion and fire in a month at a depot operated by <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION>. On May 24, more than 100,000 people were forced from the area around a gas and kerosene supply depot in the northern city of <LOCATION> Chihuahua </LOCATION>. No one was hurt, but <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION> shut down that tank farm permanently. The <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION> company <ORGANIZATION> Constructora </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quiroga </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> y </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Villarreal </ORGANIZATION>, which maintains <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION> fire-prevention equipment, gave the <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Norte </ORGANIZATION> the names of 54 of its workers who it said were at the plant when the tanks exploded. It said 13 of those people had yet to be found. <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Estella </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, a company secretary, said that some of the missing `` possibly died, because we've been told that there are people that they have n't been able to identify because they are so badly burned.'' She said she did not know if that information came from <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION> or state health officials. One of the dead, <PERSON> Vicente </PERSON> <PERSON> Quiroga </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, was owner-manager of the company, she said. She added that his son, company manager <PERSON> Vicente </PERSON> <PERSON> Quiroga </PERSON> <PERSON> Villarreal </PERSON>, was hospitalized with severe burns. `` They're Hiding Deaths,'' read a banner headline in the daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sol </ORGANIZATION>. The story said an <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sol </LOCATION> reporter sneaked into the <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cross </LOCATION> morgue wearing a <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> jacket and saw seven badly burned bodies. Efforts to reach <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION> spokesmen, in both office visits and by telephone, were unsuccessful. Secretaries said they did not know when officials could be reached. Many residents were ignoring police barricades and returning home early Friday, when it appeared the last flames had been extinguished. However, they fled in panic again when a fire reignited in one tank. Reporters outside the depot gates watched about 20 firefighters man equipment 10 yards from the burning tank as thick swirls of fire and smoke poured out. A few minutes later, the tank collapsed, but the flames continued licking another charred tank next to it. Firefighters had already managed to empty the second tank. About 150 feet away, modest homes and businesses line the avenue in this city on the eastern outskirts of the <LOCATION> Nuevo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Leon </LOCATION> state capital of <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION>, which has a metropolitan population of about 2.8 million. <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Robles </PERSON>, assistant commercial director of <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION>, blamed the explosions and fire on a leak in one of the tanks. The tanks that blew up each contained 2.2 million gallons of gasoline. The tank farm was closed Friday by both company and government officials. <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nuevo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> press </ORGANIZATION> secretary, said the depot will remain closed at least until safety experts look it over and complete an investigation. The depot, one of two petroleum supply facilities in the area, contains 23 tanks that provide regular and unleaded gasoline and diesel fuel to gasoline stations and other users in the state. However, closure of the <LOCATION> Guadalupe </LOCATION> plant was not expected to have a major impact, because gasoline can be supplied from a huge refinery at <LOCATION> Cadereyta </LOCATION>, about 30 miles away. <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> said residents were being allowed to return to their homes late Friday although `` minuscule amounts'' of gasoline was still burning in one storage tank. Thick clouds of black smoke poured across the <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION> metropolitan area Friday evening. Many of the nearly 500 evacuees who packed one emergency shelter said Friday night they were fearful of going back. `` I'm too frightened to return now,'' said <PERSON> Sofia </PERSON> <PERSON> Villegas </PERSON>, a 41-year-old mother. `` We were so happy to be going home this morning, and then it happened all over again.'' `` I'm staying the night -LRB- here -RRB-,'' she added. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> Guadalupe </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Adan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> said in an interview at one shelter that he would ask the state government to relocate the huge tank farm. Asked if he considered the depot a risk to the public safety, <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> said, `` It never stops being one.''

<HEAD>Two Egyptians, Rocket Specialist Accused In Illegal Export Scheme</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A noted rocket specialist, two Egyptian army officers and two others have been charged with illegally exporting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> technology used in sophisticated weapons like the Stealth bomber and missile nose cones. All were charged Friday with illegal export and money laundering, and conspiring to ship hundreds of pounds of a substance called carbon-carbon, or carbon composite, to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. Rocket specialist <PERSON> Abdelkader </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmy </PERSON>, described by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Levi </PERSON> as the director of the American end of the alleged international export ring, was jailed Friday in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION>. A detention hearing was scheduled Monday in federal court. The special carbon material, developed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, is used extensively in high-speed aircraft, missiles and rockets because it has a low visibility level to radar and is heat resistant. The carbon is on the federal restricted list, and requires special licenses to be exported. Two of those named in the complaint filed by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office were in custody Friday, and a third was at large but expected to surrender voluntarily The remaining two, both Egyptian army colonels with diplomatic immunity, were free _ one in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and the other in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` This is conspiracy with deep roots in the <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> area,'' <PERSON> Levi </PERSON> said in announcing the government's 35-page complaint. <PERSON> Helmy </PERSON>, an Egyptian with American citizenship, received $ 1 million in payments from apparent <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> sources through a Swiss-based bank for his role in the scheme, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities said. Carbon-carbon `` is an American technology that should n't be given to foreign nations,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Aerojet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Solid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Propulsion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which employed <PERSON> Helmy </PERSON>. The Egyptians apparently intended to use the material in a program with <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> to develop a surface-to-surface missile, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Levi </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Aerojet </ORGANIZATION> cooperated with federal agents who conducted the investigation. The probe is still under way, <PERSON> Levi </PERSON> added. Hundreds of pounds of the carbon composite were believed to have been shipped to a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, building owned by the Egyptian government, as an apparent stopover for eventual transfer to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, investigators said. About 430 pounds of the material was seized at the <LOCATION> Baltimore-Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> Friday as the defendants allegedly attempted to take it out of the country on an Egyptian C-130 military air transport. The alleged operation apparently began last year, headed overall by an Egyptian colonel based in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. Under arrest were <PERSON> Helmy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, a research engineer at <ORGANIZATION> Aerojet </ORGANIZATION>; and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Huffman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> marketing representative of <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON>, <PERSON> Selph </PERSON>, a defense aerospace company based in <LOCATION> Hollister </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Helmy </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Albia </PERSON> <PERSON> Eltayeb </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmy </PERSON>, was also named in the complaint and was scheduled to surrender voluntarily The two Egyptian army colonels are <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdella </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Hussam </PERSON> <PERSON> Yossef </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Salzburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON>, who was detained, claimed diplomatic immunity and was immediately released. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> said <PERSON> Yossef </PERSON> was n't in custody, but <PERSON> Levi </PERSON> said officials sought to interview him in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. The complaint alleged that <PERSON> Helmy </PERSON>, using his technical knowledge, directed <PERSON> Huffman </PERSON> to buy various chemicals and supplies and ship them to <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> made plans to ship them without complying with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> export controls. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said <PERSON> Helmy </PERSON> apparently used `` his position in our plant'' to receive sensitive materials. A woman answering the phone at his home about 110 miles northeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> refused to talk to a reporter. `` I have no comment on this at all,'' she said. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Wahby </PERSON>, press attache at the <ORGANIZATION> Egyptian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, said officials here were awaiting additional details from the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> before they would comment on the charges. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, the second-biggest recipient of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid after <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, gets $ 1.3 billion in military assistance annually and $ 815 million in economic support funds.

<HEAD>Jackson Starts Gaining Delegates In Puerto Rico</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who defeated <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in a `` beauty contest'' presidential ballot in March, says he is finally starting to gain some of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>'s delegates to the Democratic National Convention next month. Although <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had won the March 20 primary, the voting was only advisory. In April, Gov. <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Colon </PERSON> said he and at least 53 others in the <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> delegation would support <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> at the national convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. After meeting Friday night with the governor and legislative leaders, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he has picked up at least eight of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>'s 57 delegates to the Democratic convention since arriving here Thursday night, and his campaign said he wants at least 17. `` What is at stake here is more than the nomination. It's the future of our country, the future of relations. When we get to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, he may very well have more delegates, but I will have more supporters,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told reporters. The 3.2 million Puerto Ricans are <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens who are largely self-governing but subject to federal laws. They have delegations at the presidential nominating conventions. But Puerto Rican residents do not vote in national elections and their representative in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has no vote. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he supports Puerto Rican self-determination. Puerto Ricans, he said, should `` choose their own form of government with no interference and without intimidation.'' He has indicated he supports a transfer of powers from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> before a <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rican </LOCATION> vote on political status. The governing party supports commonwealth status, established in 1952, but wants greater local power. Some believe ending legal ties to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> before voting on status would virtually rule out statehood. Republican presidential nominee-to-be <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supports statehood for <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s ousted President <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> planned to spend the weekend with friends in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> before flying to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> Sunday in search of the support he failed to find in the Haitian expatriate community here. <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON>, who arrived here Friday with his wife <PERSON> Myrlande </PERSON> and teen-age daughter <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON>, said he had not decided where to settle or what to do in the immediate future. Exiled to the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> last Sunday when he was overthrown by Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> appealed to Americans for support in freeing <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> from the military dictatorship. `` Give us your support against the military coup,'' <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> pleaded at <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. `` Give us your support for the reestablishment of democracy in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>.'' He said he shared the basic <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> democratic values and was overthrown for trying to `` put forward the fundamental principle of civilian power over the military.'' He also said some in the military were angered by his fight against corruption and smuggling. But local leaders in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s Haitian community, thought to number up to 100,000, said they would ignore <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON>'s visit, calling him a discarded military puppet installed through a rigged election. `` We could care less about <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Biamby </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Haitian-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Only about 25 Haitians _ many of them worried family members of <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> advisers imprisoned in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> after the coup _ showed up at the airport to greet him. Asked why <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Haitians did not support him, <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> noted that many of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>'s followers had not supported him at the time of the crucifiction, but cautioned he was not comparing himself to <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>. <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> called on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> to pressure <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>'s government to release his advisers, whom he said were still being arrested on a daily basis. He ignored shouted questions about his relationship with Col. <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, under indictment here for drug trafficking. <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON>'s decision to side with <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> against <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> triggered the coup which once again put <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> in control of the country, the poorest in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>.

 Amid shouts of `` Fire!'' and the thunder of cannon, thousands of men in blue and gray stormed each other to re-enact the opening of the Battle of <LOCATION> Gettysburg </LOCATION>, 125 years after the Civil War's bloodiest confrontation. A total of about 8,000 men representing Union and Confederate troops traded mock rifle volleys and cannon bursts Friday, ripping open paper gunpowder cartridges with their teeth while enemy lines closed in. The Confederate troops pushed back the Union's black-hatted `` Iron Brigade,'' as scores of men on both sides feigned death in the tall grass and spectators watched from a hill overlooking the field. `` When it gets to firing, you're not in 1988 anymore, you're in 1863,'' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Douthit </PERSON>, a 28-year-old farmer from <LOCATION> Unionville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. The participants, among them teachers, engineers, artists and soldiers, had invested $ 1,000 to outfit themselves with the uniform, gear and guns needed to become Civil War soldiers, if only for a day or two. Soldiers in the 23rd <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regiment </ORGANIZATION>, played by a group from <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, went so far as to follow Union recipes down to `` hard tack,'' hard, flat squares of bread. `` You might think it was made 125 years ago. It's that indigestable,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Gouvier </PERSON>, a 37-year-old engineer from <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>. Mentioning anything modern by members of the 23rd <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> resulted in punishment: standing on a wooden crate at the end of one of the rows of white, canvas tents. <PERSON> Gouvier </PERSON> said people joined the outfit for a chance to relive history, for the camaraderie, or to take part in the battles. `` I've always been a history fanatic,'' he said. Others had more personal reasons for joining one of the ersatz armies. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> DiCarlo </PERSON>, of <PERSON> Owings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, said he became a member of the 18th <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regiment </ORGANIZATION> in part because his great-great-great-grandfather was a captain in the <ORGANIZATION> Confederate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. `` My wife thinks I'm crazy,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Napoleonic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tactics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which sold tickets to cover its $ 450,000 budget for staging three days of ersatz warfare, has billed the event as the largest Civil War re-enactment ever. The consulting company was hired by the event's sponor, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> War </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commemorative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. A total of 75,000 spectators were expected to attend the re-enactment on farmland five miles south of the actual battlefield The event ends Sunday with the restaging of <PERSON> Pickett </PERSON>'s Charge The Battle of <LOCATION> Gettysburg </LOCATION> took place from July 1-3, 1863, and resulted in a total of close to 50,000 dead and wounded. Confederate Gen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> was moving from the north toward <LOCATION> Gettysburg </LOCATION> to get shoes for his troops and secure the roads running through the southern <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> town, said <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Holien </PERSON>, a historian for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> of Military History. The Union's Army of the <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION> was moving north when the chance encounter at <PERSON> McPherson </PERSON>'s Ridge touched off the bloody battle, he said. Many of the current `` soldiers'' said they prepared for the battle for months because its size set it apart. Tactical commanders for both sides met Thursday night to map out the next day's skirmish. `` Supposedly everything's supposed to happen according to the script,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Baebler </PERSON>, a spokesman for Napoleonic Tactics. `` The people who won the first time will win again.'' he said. Organizers had said the number of troops falling `` dead'' in Friday's skirmish would be proportionate to actual losses. But <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kraus </PERSON>, commander of the Union forces, said troops often improvise on the field. `` It's an individual thing,'' said <PERSON> Kraus </PERSON>, a 34-year-old artist from <LOCATION> Creston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. The largest previous Civil War re-enactment was the Battle of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manassas </ORGANIZATION> in July 1986, involving 6,000 re-enactors, according to Napoleonic Tactics.

 Former Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> says his impeachment conviction was unfair and he'll go to court in a bid to get his job back. `` We think that it's important to challenge this,'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> said Friday. Leaving the conviction unchallenged would open all public officials to impeachment, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> said, adding, `` Who knows? You may see me back on the ninth floor -LRB- the governor's office -RRB- before the next election.'' The former governor on Friday also delivered a harsh attack on <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, saying he is dishonest and is not qualified to be vice president. <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, a first-term senator who called for <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s resignation in January, has been among those mentioned as a possible running mate for Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the certain <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee. `` No, <PERSON> John </PERSON> is n't qualified to be vice president,'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> said in an interview with KTSP-TV. `` He does n't have the intellect, he does n't have the stature, he does n't have the honesty, he does n't have the character that it takes, and he certainly does n't have the political foundation. <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, who was speaking Friday night in <LOCATION> Watertown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s behalf, said, `` Former Governor <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> is entitled to his opinion. ... Nothing surprises me.'' <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> said he was not seeking the vice presidential nomination, noting that other qualified candidates come from states with more electoral votes. The senator has said he backs Sen. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON>, R-Kan., for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> second spot Both <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> and <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> are members of the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> delegation to the national GOP convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> Aug. 15-18. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was convicted April 4 by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on impeachment charges of misusing $ 80,000 from the governor's protocol fund and trying to thwart an investigation of an alleged death threat. He was acquitted June 16 on criminal charges of concealing a $ 350,000 campaign loan. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> governor to be impeached and removed from office in 59 years. The former governor said he probably would take his challenge to to federal court, although the decision will be up to his lawyers. He also said it was uncertain how soon it will be filed.

<HEAD>Police Thwart Student Occupation Of Prosecutors Office</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police today seized 15 radical students who briefly occupied the office of the top prosecutor in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and demanded the punishment of former President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON>. Police said the students used iron bars and firebombs to force their way into the prosecutors' building in downtown <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and staged a violent protest for 15 minutes before being overpowered. Riot police squads using tear gas arrested five students at the gate and another 10 who resisted on the second floor of the building, which houses offices of the prosecutor general and other senior prosecutors. `` Punish Chun'' and `` Drive out <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION>,'' the students shouted as they smashed windowns and furniture and demanded the punishment of the former president and his wife. On Friday, scores of people were detained when riot police roughly broke up a sit-in protest by 150 students and dissidents in front of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. Police kicked and punched the protesters who urged <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s punishment. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> and his family have been the target of opposition charges of corruption and embezzlement since he stepped down from the presidency in February. Dissidents also criticized <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> for being responsible for numerous cases of torture and brutality during a civil uprising in the southern city of <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>. They accused <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of masterminding the South Korean army's suppression of the <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> uprising. Nearly 200 people were killed in the uprising, and dissidents charge the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with condoning the suppression. Radical students have staged violent anti-government and anti-U.S. protests in the past months, demanding the removal of the 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops stationed here under a mutual defense pact. They contend the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has enforced partition of the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula and rules the south as a colony. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> divided the peninsula at the end of World War II. Meanwhile, thousands of war veterans and others held a peaceful anti-communist rally in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> today to mark the 38th anniversary of the three-year Korean War. `` Safeguard the Olympics and our nation from communists,'' they shouted as speakers also denounced leftist groups in the south and the communist north. Government officials have accused radicals of playing into <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s strategy of formenting anti-U.S. sentiment and demanding the co-hosting of the Olympics opening Sept. 17 in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. In a memorial statement, government spokesman <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> <PERSON> Han-mo </PERSON> charged that some radical groups even consider the Korean War as `` a proper effort to unify the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> land.'' <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> invaded the south on June 25, 1950. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and 15 other Western countries formed the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> to help repel the North Korean invasion. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> sided with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in the war.

<HEAD>Japan Says Noriega Government In Panama Not Illegal</HEAD>

 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> announced today that unlike the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> it does not believe the government of Panamanian military leader Gen. <PERSON> Manual </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is illegal. `` We have found no evidence that the present government of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is illegal,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` Whether or not their government is legal is no longer an issue in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> either.'' On Thursday, the Japanese ambassador to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Teruyuki </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawai </PERSON>, met Panamanian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Abadia </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> for the first time since <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> engineered the ouster of former President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>. On Feb. 25, the military-controlled legislative assembly ousted <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, who had tried to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, commander of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s 15,000-member Defense Forces <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has been indicted by two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> federal grand juries on drug - trafficking charges He has successfully resisted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions aimed at forcing him to step down. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has consistently called the present Panamanian government illegal. The Japanese official declined to elaborate on Thursday's meeting, which was held in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, saying only that it followed actions by other countries, including <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> had withheld its official position on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, apparently for fear of antagonizing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is a major consumer of Japanese goods. In addition, the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> serves as a vital link for Japanese products bound for the <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> and for agricultural products headed for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s second largest trading partner after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, maintains a $ 3.2 billion trade surplus with the central American nation. In turn, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest export market in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> as well as the top recipient of Japanese direct investment in the region.

 A concrete ceiling weakened by a long-term leak that had been covered up collapsed on a guest at the <LOCATION> Helmsley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Windsor </LOCATION> hotel, killing him as he slept in his $ 200-a-night, top-floor suite, authorities said. The victim, <PERSON> Carmello </PERSON> <PERSON> Liuzzo </PERSON>, 35, of <LOCATION> Greensboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> was buried under the debris that fell onto and around his bed early Friday. One 4-foot hunk of concrete about 10 inches thick fell squarely on his body, said police Lt. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. Between 1 -LCB- and 2 tons of concrete, plaster and cinder crashed into the small bedroom. City Buildings Commissioner <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said a summons will be issued to <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>, who head the organization that controls the hotel. They would be cited for `` failure to maintain a structurally sound building,'' which could bring up to a $ 5,000 fine and 30 days in jail. `` I think it's clear that they were aware that there had been deterioration,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` The false ceiling is evidence that they tried to cover up a badly damaged ceiling.'' He said his inspectors found an indentation 3 inches deep and 6 feet across on the roof in which rain and melted snow collected and leaked into cinder insulation between two concrete slabs. Over time, the insulation became heavy and compacted and the water visibly rusted and deteriorated reinforcement in the lower slab, he said. `` It had not been repaired _ it had been covered up,'' said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. `` Someone did not do their job.'' The 304-room hotel, which <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said dates from 1926, is leased by <ORGANIZATION> Winmar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of the <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> organization, said hotel spokesman <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearle </PERSON>. A statement issued in the name of Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Helmsley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotels </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` We were shocked and devastated to hear of the tragedy. ... Our hearts go out to the family. `` We have a team of consulting structural engineers conducting an in-depth examination of the entire building. Until that is completed, we wo n't comment on the buildings commissioner's statements,'' the statement said According to Inspector <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McCabe </PERSON>, <PERSON> Liuzzo </PERSON> checked into the midtown hotel Wednesday with his wife. The couple had asked for a $ 120-a-night room, <PERSON> Hearle </PERSON> said. Because none was available, they were given a better accommodation at the same price _ Room 1628, a $ 200 corner suite with a bedroom, parlor, pantry and bath, <PERSON> Hearle </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Liuzzo </PERSON> checked out Thursday, <PERSON> McCabe </PERSON> said.

 About 150,000 Estonians gathered in meadow outside the capital of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> and demanded that Soviet officials grant greater autonomy to its republics, a newspaper said. The group also denounced Soviet dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, who seized <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, according to the report in Tuesday's edition of Soviet <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> newspaper, seen in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Friday. The call for a Soviet federation of republics with the right to manage their own affairs came at a rally organized by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a group of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members and other people founded in April with official backing. The paper quoted leaders of the rally in the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> republic </LOCATION> as saying <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s 32 delegates to next week's party conference in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> should seek approval to turn the region into a sovereign republic. Five of the delegates spoke at the meeting. They said they wanted <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> to be given the right to fix its own prices, pay and investments, and to formulate its own cultural, ecological and other policies. <PERSON> Tiit </PERSON> <PERSON> Vyakhi </PERSON>, a delegate from an Estonian auto repair shop, told the crowd, `` I think it's very important for <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> and all republics to get their sovereignty recognized. It's necessary to confirm the principle of a united federation composed of sovereign states with fully equal rights.'' Hundreds of intellectuals in <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> have made similar demands for a form of home rule for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s 15 republics. The Baltic republics, incorporated into the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> under a secret protocol of the 1939 Soviet-Nazi pact, have long been the country's most economically developed and Westward-looking regions Other delegates and speakers at the unprecedented meeting in a meadow outside the Estonian capital of <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION> demanded immediate condemnation of Stalinism and, by implication, of the Soviet seizure of the Baltic republics in 1940. The official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday that <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> has set up a commission chaired by <ORGANIZATION> republican </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruutel </PERSON> `` to do justice'' to thousands of victims of Stalinist deportations in 1941 and 1949. `` Dear delegates,'' a lathe operator from <LOCATION> Tartu </LOCATION> told the rally, `` you do n't have any time to wait for the final, titanic works of doctors of science about our history. `` Within a few days, you must make clear who it was in 1940 who hacked up our science books and children's books with axes and make clear that we are a people of many centuries of culture.'' The report said speeches at the rally were greeted `` not just with applause, but with the thunder of ovations.'' Pictures published with the accounts showed crowds waving banners calling for an end to privilege and praising the new <ORGANIZATION> Estonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> party leader <PERSON> Vaino </PERSON> <PERSON> Vyalyas </PERSON>, named to his post June 16. Although speakers emphasized nationalist demands, they stressed they did not want to secede from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and none was quoted as challenging the rule of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Dissatisfaction has been rising in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> over the migration of ethnic Russians into the republic where ethnic Estonians are now a minority, and over what is seen as the diminishing role of Estonian language and traditions. Conference delegate <PERSON> Mare </PERSON> <PERSON> Rossmann </PERSON>, a teacher, was quoted as saying Estonians `` simply want to live freely and happily on our land.'' `` We want to decide ourselves what happiness is. We think this is the right of all peoples,'' she said. The newspaper did not explain why it took four days to publish an account of the meeting, which it said was held June 17, a day before <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s state-run media published the republic's platform for next week's national party conference in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The account of the rally suggested the militant mood in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> has at least the tacit backing of the republic's <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and that citizens expect immediate results from the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> conference opening on Tuesday.

 A British businessman held in an <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> prison has issued a plea for better relations between <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>'s appeal came in a 16-page handwritten letter released Friday by a parliamentary delegation back from an unofficial mission to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyttle </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Archbishop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canterbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Runcie </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> gave him the letter while he was in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. He passed it on to the four-member delegation, which returned to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> on Wednesday. The letter, dated June 20, said news of the mission `` filled me with hope,'' and urged <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to take the initiative to improve relations. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, 53, has lived in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for more than 20 years. He was arrested in December 1985 and jailed for alleged spying. He is being held in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s Evin Prison. `` <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is seen as a sly neo-colonialist, ` an old fox' much more skilled than the <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> or Russians in politics _ and therefore potentially more dangerous,'' the letter said. It said Iranians criticized <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> for participation in a U.S.-led economic blockade of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and for supplying <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> with materials useful in its nearly 8-year-old war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The letter pleaded for increased aid, trade and cultural relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON>, leader of the Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, arranged the mission's three-day visit to explore ways of bringing about the release of Britons in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> who are believed held by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremists

 Hundreds of barges began creeping along the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> rivers through newly dredged channels, while farmers, clergymen and politicians prayed for relief from the hot, dry weather that has baked fields of crops. A cold front brought scattered rain to parts of the upper <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and broke a heat wave in the Northeast, but Friday was the eighth straight day of 100-degree heat over the central part of the nation. Four people have died as a result of the heat. Nineteen Miss <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> contestants donned raincoats and umbrellas to sing `` Come Rain or Come Shine,'' but there was more shine than rain in the state. Along the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, dredging crews removed sand that caused a 30-mile-long traffic jam of towboats and 1,100 barges near <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, but low water levels forced slow-going on the river. `` We should have all the backup cleared out of here by midday Sunday,'' Coast Guard Cmdr. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Donohoe </PERSON> said. Authorities hoped to have the remaining blockage on the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> cleared today above <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Page </PERSON>, assistant secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> for civil works in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C </LOCATION>. The drought has left the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> so low that its current is too slow to prevent saltwater from creeping upstream from the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, threatening drinking water supplies and marshes where oysters and other seafood grow. The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> announced plans to build a $ 600,000 dike near <LOCATION> Myrtle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, 63 miles upstream from the mouth of the river, to block some of the saltwater. On the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, 87 towboats and their barges began moving Friday, but traffic went in only one direction because of the narrow channel that crews dredged, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Lt. j.g. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Clifton </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Paducah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>. Forty-two cities on Friday from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> either tied or broke high temperature records for the date In the Northeast, readings dropped into the 70s and lower 80s, and record lows were reported in a half-dozen cities, including 40 degrees at <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rapid </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Huron </PERSON>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, and Casper, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, tied or broke hig - temperature records for June, while Valentine, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, hit 110 degrees for its high record on any In <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, the medical examiner's office said three elderly women had died of hyperthermia. In <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, a woman died of a heart attack brought on by heat stroke while working in a tobacco field, <LOCATION> Thomas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Coroner <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said Friday. Missouri's <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> said $ 400,000 would be made available to lend low-income households fans and air conditioners and help pay their electric bills. Scattered rain Friday brought some relief to parts of the upper <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> before the hot air returned to bake the soil. `` It's unbelievable how much the crop is stunted. It's about half the size in growth it should be, but now it's perked up because of the rain,'' said farmer <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Mick </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenley </PERSON> near Independence, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, which got about an inch. `` The nourishment we took from this rain left the crops with a happy face.'' But he said he still faces a 20 percent loss on his normal yields of corn and beans even if he gets 2 inches of rain per week for the next several weeks. Hot wind fanned forest fires in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, and at least seven <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> counties have banned fireworks on July 4 because of the fire danger. <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> banned outdoor smoking, open fires and fireworks in all state parks, forests and other state land Friday. <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> asked citizens to join him in praying for rain Sunday and several <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> churches were holding nightly prayer meetings to plead for rain. In <LOCATION> Eureka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, about 400 residents and five clergymen prayed for rain Friday afternoon in 101-degree heat. It rained a small amount, but not in town. `` God answers our prayers, whether it's today or tomorrow,'' resident <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Gruebele </PERSON> said. `` Maybe he says yes and maybe he says no _ and maybe he says wait.''

 Chairman <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s grandson might be tall and hefty but that's the only thing that makes him stand out in a crowd, a newspaper reported today. <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said the 18-year-old grandson of late leader <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON> `` could be considered a ` huge monster' when compared with the average high school student.'' <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Xinyu </PERSON>, who stands 5-foot, 10-inches tall and weighs nearly 220 pounds, is the son of <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Anqing </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>'s only known living son. A report last December said the 62-year-old <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Anqing </PERSON>, his wife, <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaohua </PERSON>, and their only son were living quietly in a <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> villa. <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON> married four times and had nine children, including a daughter by his last wife, <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Qing </PERSON>. He died in 1976. <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Qing </PERSON> is believed alive. Detailed reports of the lives of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leaders and their families are rare. The paper described the high school senior as an amiable and cheerful youth who gets along well with his classmates and is treated just like any other student. He is fond of history `` perhaps because of the historical legacy of his forefathers,'' and his best grades are in history class, the report said. Besides his schoolbooks and some historical writings, <PERSON> Xinyu </PERSON> also likes to read classical novels, historical drama and classical poetry, it said. As he prepares for the nationwide college entrance exams that will be administered next month, <PERSON> Xinyu </PERSON> is still trying to decide what to study.

Since the end of the Cultural Revolution in 1976, <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> has been criticized for creating a cult of personality and for leftist excesses that drove <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s economy into the ground.

<HEAD>Party Conference to Take Up Freer Economic Competition</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Speakers at next week's national <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conference will plea for greater economic competition in the state-run economy, an adviser to Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Abalkin </PERSON>, head of the economics institute in the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, called Friday for an `` atmosphere of competition, winning over the consumer,'' and open competition by individual enterprises for state orders. Reformers have heavily criticized the centrally controlled system of economic planning. However, <PERSON> Abalkin </PERSON> said the country's economic system will be radically changed beginning in the early 1990s, and those changes will be discussed at the conference that begins Tuesday. <PERSON> Abalkin </PERSON> said several speeches to the conference of 5,000 delegates will be devoted to encouraging economic competition. His comments represented one of the few signs from officials of a specific topic to be considered and an indication of the issue's importance in the eyes of economic reformers The economist is a delegate to the party conference and a key adviser to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Several speeches to the party conference will criticize the system of government procurement, now accomplished by a vast system of orders to individual state-run businesses, he said. Reforms do n't intend to do away with government procurement, but change `` the ways they reach the enterprises, not the old ways _ command and bureaucratic _ but the method based on competition between enterprises to win government orders,'' <PERSON> Abalkin </PERSON> said. `` I am certain that more than one statement will be devoted to this question,'' he said. He added that satisfying pent-up demand for consumer goods and services `` will be possible only if the monopolization by the producer is ruled out and economic competition between individual enterprises is asserted.'' Reformers trace many of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s economic problems to a bureaucratic system of management that stifles local initiative and ignores market demands. Asked about a radical Estonian economic program for the party conference, <PERSON> Abalkin </PERSON> said central authorities must allow local officials more economic freedom but be careful not to permit a rise of nationalism. The Estonian platform for the party conference asks central authorities to give the republic complete control over prices, wages and investment policy. Officials have indicated that the conference will discuss problems among the more than 100 ethnic groups that live in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The problems have been highlighted in recent months by unrest in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> and other Baltic republics and a tense dispute between <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> over control of the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> region of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. The conference, the first since 1941, is to consider a program put forth by the party's policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that calls for party bureaucrats to stop interfering in government decisions and economic management. It also seeks to limit the terms of elected party officials.

<HEAD>Official Report: Lebanon's Waters Not Radioactive</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Lebanese territorial waters are neither radioactive nor contaminated by tons of Italian toxic waste that have been dumped in recent months in this chaotic country, news reports said today. <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s daily <ORGANIZATION> As-Safir </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> issued a report saying the waters were not contaminated after an expert committee examined samples of sea water Friday. A Lebanese businessman imported 2,400 tons of toxic chemical waste from <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> two weeks ago and some of it was reported dumped on the <LOCATION> Kesrouan </LOCATION> coastal strip 20 miles north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. In addition, about 40 barrels inscribed `` <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> Oil'' and containing suspicious-looking pink and golden powder were discovered off the coast of Tyre in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Tabarja </LOCATION> in the north. The two events, combined with an outbreak of skin rashes among people who swam in the sea, drove the usually stoic Lebanese off their beaches. `` The contents of the barrels, the sea water and fish examined are not radioactive,'' said the report. `` The barrels contain organic brown powder that does not include any heavy poisonous metallic material,'' it said. The ministry qualifed the report in saying it was sending `` maritime biological and geological samples for further examination abroad to determine whether future risks are involved.'' It did not elaborate or say where it was sending the samples. The statement urged the Lebanese not to swim in the sea and to avoid eating fish, pending the outcome of the final report expected in two weeks.

 Chinese officials are listening carefully to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> residents' worries about laws that will govern them when the colony reverts to Chinese rule in 1997, a British envoy said today. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s government announced today that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> will increase its share of the colony's defense costs during the nine years before <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> takes over. In a brief statement, the government said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> will shoulder 35 percent of defense costs, up from 25 percent under the formula that expired March 31. About 13,000 British soldiers and dependents are stationed on the colony. In <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenarthur </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s state minister for <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> affairs, told a news conference that he discussed <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> residents' concerns with Chinese officials.

The draft was completed in April, and the Chinese legislature was expected to pass a final version by 1990. `` It was quite clear to me that -LRB- Chinese Vice Foreign Minister -RRB- <PERSON> Zhou </PERSON> <PERSON> Nan </PERSON> paid careful attention to what I was saying and that the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government is taking equally careful note of the views expressed in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>,'' the British envoy said. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has ruled the thriving port of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s southeast coast, since 1842 The British official also said Chinese leaders expressed support for the recent decision by <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s colonial government to repatriate those Vietnamese boat people not fleeing political persecution.

<HEAD>Challenge To Small Town's Ban On Dancing Heading To Court</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PURDY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Students in this small southwestern <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> town who just wan na dance go to court Monday to see if a federal judge will strike up the right tune. `` I did n't think it would go this far,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, 18, a spring graduate of <ORGANIZATION> Purdy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, where about 160 students were enrolled. `` We started this, I just want to see it get finished.'' At issue is one sentence that has been part of the <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON> school board's policy book for as long as anyone can remember: `` School dances are not authorized and school premises shall not be used for purposes of conducting a dance.'' Residents say generations of students in the town of about 900 people have made an annual ritual of appealing to the school board to rescind the ban, then quietly accepting a refusal that came as regularly as a final exam. <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>'s class was different. <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> is among 21 <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON> students and their parents who filed suit in 1986, asking the courts to strike down the ban as an unconstitutional encroachment of religious values on public life. <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> said fellow students have told him they're against dancing because parents and ministers have told them it is a sin. Pro-dancers believe the ban _ unique among southern <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> school districts _ has endured because many in the community have a Southern Baptist-inspired opposition to dancing. `` That's not true,'' said <PERSON> Ransom </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, the attorney representing the school board. `` The motivation was purely secular.'' <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> said he would not expand on his argument because it would mean revealing evidence he planned to present in court. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> has set aside four days beginning Monday to hear the case in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> was also considering a countersuit filed by the school district in which officials seek $ 1 million in damages, claiming students and parents have harassed them over the dancing issue. The suit filed by students and parents, with backing from the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, seeks a court order to keep the school from enforcing the dance ban, attorneys fees and $ 1 in damages. In 1986, <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON> students signed a petition in support of a school dance and asked for their parents' help when they took the request before the school board. They were met with resistance organized in local churches. So many people were drawn to the school board meeting at which the ban was challenged that it had to be moved to the high school gymnasium. Dance supporters were unable to get the school board to end the ban, though they followed the petition drive with a rally that drew national attention. The students invited stars of the musical `` Footloose,'' a movie about a fictional <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> town where dancing was banned, to the rally. Actors <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lori </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON> were unable to attend. In April 1986, school district voters re-elected by wide margins the anti-dancing board members. The controversy escalated to the point where dance supporters and opponents walked on opposite sides of the street. `` A lot of people refer to me as a troublemaker, an outsider,'' said <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>'s mother. Her family has lived in <LOCATION> Purdy </LOCATION> for 13 years, but remain newcomers in the eyes of lifelong residents, Mrs. <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> said. It has n't helped that she is a vocal supporter of what she says is her children's right to dance at school `` They should n't be barred from homecoming and prom at school _ it's a public school,'' she said.

<HEAD>Jury Says Cigarettes Should Have Carried Warning, But Awards No
Damages</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A jury's decision that cigarettes should have carried a warning label before 1966 should encourage other lung-cancer victims to sue manufacturers, despite the fact that no damages were awarded, an attorney said. `` This is very similar to the history of asbestos litigation where at the beginning cases were lost and now liability is clearly established,'' said <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Shein </PERSON>, an attorney for the estate of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunsalus </PERSON>. A federal jury said Friday that cigarettes manufactured by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> were defective prior to 1966 because they did not have a warning label. But it said the lack of a warning was not a `` substantial factor'' in <PERSON> Gunsalus </PERSON>' death of lung cancer last year at age 55. <PERSON> Gunsalus </PERSON>, a Pall Mall smoker who first lit up at age 11, worked at the <LOCATION> Chester </LOCATION> shipyards where asbestos was prevalent, and the case brought by his estate sought to tie the hazards of smoking to those of working around asbestos. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Conforti </PERSON>, public information director for <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, Conn.-based parent company of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION>, said the company was pleased with the verdict. The case was decided less than two weeks after a jury in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, decided a tobacco company should pay $ 400,000 to the widower of a lifelong smoker. It was the first monetary award from a cigarette maker after about 300 attempts in courtrooms from coast to coast. <PERSON> Shein </PERSON> said Friday's ruling poses a `` serious threat to -LRB- tobacco companies -RRB- in the future.'' Attorneys were considering an appeal, he added. The estate had been seeking unspecified damages for pain and suffering. `` We intend to continue this area of litigation and believe this should encourage other injured parties who have brought similar actions against tobacco companies,'' he said. According to testimony from Dr. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Graduate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gunsalus </PERSON> died of cancer caused by smoking and asbestos exposure. <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON>, a witness for the <PERSON> Gunsalus </PERSON> estate, said the interaction of asbestos and cigarette smoke creates a far greater risk of cancer than either substance does on its own. But American Tobacco attorney <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mannino </PERSON> argued that <PERSON> Gunsalus </PERSON>' health history, not smoking's dangers, were the issue. He pointed to <PERSON> Gunsalus </PERSON>' history of heavy drinking, multiple stab wounds and three heart attacks. In closing remarks Thursday, <PERSON> Mannino </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gunsalus </PERSON> smoked because he chose to and described him as a `` strong-willed'' person who ignored six doctors' warnings to quit smoking. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, an attorney for <PERSON> Gunsalus </PERSON>' estate, responded by telling the jury the `` unspoken assumption'' of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION>'s argument `` is what does it matter if we kill a bum?''

 Angolan guerrilla leader <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>'s fervor for stopping communism in his homeland was hailed by Cuban exiles here, yet his acceptance of arms from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has raised questions. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> rebels, spoke here Friday as part of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tour to drum up support and discuss peace talks aimed at ending the 13-year civil war with <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s Marxist, Cuban-backed government. But the burly, personable <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> has found himself on a public relations tightrope. He is cheered for his struggle for democratic freedom, yet denounced for accepting arms from a government that openly practices racial discrimination. `` I'm not here to discuss the policies of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, which I condemn. I'm fighting for freedom and you must do it any way you can,'' <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> told a news conference. `` When you are fighting for your country, you must get help from even the devil himself.'' <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>, who has been criticized by Democratic presidential contender <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and influential blacks, said that even <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> patriots enlisted the aid of European monarchies in the revolution against the British monarchy. `` In a fight for freedom, sometimes you have to look out for your interests first,'' he said. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> said a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> troop buildup in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> clouds the peace talks that began this week in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, the third round of discussions in two months. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which also helps arm the Angolan guerrillas, is mediating between <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and a joint Angolan-Cuban delegation to resolve <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s civil war and end South African rule over neighboring <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. The talks have so far hinged on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s demand that <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> withdraw its troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> as a precondition for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s independence `` There were 45,000 Cuban troops in March, and now there are 57,000,'' <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> said. `` They're not withdrawing; they're increasing tremendously <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>'s one-day visit to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> was sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Cuban-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a staunchly anti-communist group with offices here and in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> reshuffled his Cabinet today and said he would no longer serve as his own foreign minister because he wanted to devote more time to politics. The Cabinet changes, <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s 13th since he took office in 1984, followed setbacks for his <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in last week's parliamentary elections By divesting himself of the foreign minister's job, <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> can turn fuller attention to the challenge posed by his chief political rival, former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Minister V.P. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, who broke with the prime minister last year over the government's slowness in investigating allegations that bribes were paid in foreign arms deals, won a parliamentary seat in the <LOCATION> Allahabad </LOCATION> district. He easily defeated the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> candidate by a 2-to-1 majority, boosting his chances of opposing <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> himself for national leadership in the coming 18 months. National elections must be conducted no later than January 1990. Asked today whether `` panic'' over <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>'s Allahabad victory was the reason for the Cabinet reshuffle, <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> replied: `` Not at all ... Do I look panicky?'' He said he would not resign and would not call an early election. The country's two national news agencies, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION>, quoted the prime minister as saying he wanted to devote more time to political work. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> assigned the post of foreign minister to P.V. <PERSON> Narasimha </PERSON> <PERSON> Rao </PERSON>, who had served as minister of human resource development in the last Cabinet. He was one of nine men given new Cabinet-level responsibilities in the reshuffle. All are <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> veteran politicians. Two of the new Cabinet members, Finance Minister S.B. <PERSON> Chavan </PERSON> and Commerce Minister <PERSON> Bir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bahadur </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, stepped down as chief ministers of Indian states on Friday following allegations they had been inept in upholding the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> banner. Their inclusion 24 hours later in <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s new Cabinet brought a scathing retort from <LOCATION> L.K </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Advani </PERSON>, president of a right-wing opposition group, the <ORGANIZATION> Bharatiya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Janata </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. He called the new Cabinet `` a waste basket of rejected chief ministers,'' <ORGANIZATION> PTI </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Bir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bahadur </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> was chief minister of <LOCATION> Uttar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> lost one parliamentary seat and two state assembly seats to opposition candidates in the June 16 elections. <PERSON> Chavan </PERSON> was chief minister of <LOCATION> Maharashtra </LOCATION>, where a militant Hindu party, the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Shiv </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sena </ORGANIZATION>, won recent city council elections in <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>, the state capital. Since <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> took office in 1984 following the assassination of his mother and predecessor, Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has lost 10 of 14 state elections. In another key Cabinet appointment, <PERSON> Baburao </PERSON> <PERSON> Shankaranand </PERSON> was named minister of law, justice and water resources. <PERSON> Shankaranand </PERSON> was water resources minister in a previous Cabinet but resigned last summer to head a parliamentary investigation that kickbacks were paid to facilitate <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s purchases of artillery guns from the Swedish company, <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION>. The investigation concluded there was no evidence that kickbacks were paid. Following new reports this week in the daily newspaper, Hindu, that commissions were paid in the <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION> deal, <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> said he had asked the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION> to look into the matter. The Cabinet now has 20 members, including <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> who retains responsibility for science and technology, atomic energy and space. The last Cabinet had 16 members.

 A small alligator found snoozing in a <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> vegetable garden is just a run-of-the-mill reptile and not a missing sex-changed gator stolen from <ORGANIZATION> Memphis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, a biologist says.

<HEAD>Admiral Calls For One Court-Martial In Recruit's Death</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 An admiral has called for the court-martial of a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> swimming instructor accused of holding a recruit's head under water and literally scaring him to death, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. Four other enlisted men and an officer accused in the death have until Monday to decide whether to accept more lenient disciplinary action or pursue a court-martial, Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hessler </PERSON> said Friday. Rear Adm. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, chief of naval air training, also dropped involuntary manslaughter charges against the enlisted men, except for Petty Officer 2nd Class <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Combe </PERSON>, for whom he has recommended the court-martial, <PERSON> Hessler </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> accused <PERSON> Combe </PERSON> of holding Airman Recruit <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>, 19, of <LOCATION> Appleton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, under water after <PERSON> Combe </PERSON> and other instructors pushed or tossed the trainee into a pool when he panicked and tried to quit the course. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> recommended the court-martial to Vice Adm. N.R. Thunman, chief of naval education and training, the ranking officer in <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Hessler </PERSON>, Thunman's public affairs officer. `` It seems like he felt possibly that <PERSON> Combe </PERSON> was the most culpable, and I have to respect his decision because we are not part of the military process,'' <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Johansen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>'s sister, said in <LOCATION> Appleton </LOCATION>. The decisions show all six defendants share the blame, she said. `` These men lacked professional judgment, and that's obvious,'' she said. `` Everyone's saying that the system failed, but these men were part of it.'' At a five-day investigative hearing two weeks ago, defense attorneys argued the system was at fault because <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> was allowed to return to training through a series of mix-ups after a flight surgeon declared him unfit and because use of force was a common practice condoned by authorities to keep scared, tired or malingering trainees in the pool. <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> had been described at the hearing as having died from `` sheer terror.'' A pathologist testified <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> had a phobia about being dragged under water, which triggered heart failure followed by drowning, although there was no determination of which factor killed him. <PERSON> Combe </PERSON> and the four other instructors had been charged with conspiracy to commit battery and involuntary manslaughter. Lt. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON>, the officer in charge of the school, was accused of dereliction of duty and transferred. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> offered to resolve the cases of <LOCATION> Torchia </LOCATION>, Petty Officers 1st Class <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blevins </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and Petty Officers 2nd Class <PERSON> Frankie </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Deaton </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zelenock </PERSON> with non-judicial punishment, <PERSON> Hessler </PERSON> said. If they decide to accept the offer, the extent of punishment would be determined at a proceeding known as an admiral's nest. They could face a pay cut, reduction in rank, restriction to the base or other penalties. A court-martial would enable a defendant to be cleared if acquitted but carries the risk of penalities that include prison time and removal from the service for a conviction.

<HEAD>Fire Burning Out Again, Some Remain Evacuated</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CROFTON, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Workers began to dismantle the exterior of a derailed <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> tanker in preparation for its move to a safe place today after awaiting the burnout of a toxic fire that prompted the evacuation of 15,000. The fire had died down enough by late Friday to allow workers to remove the ruptured steel jacket of the car. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> `` </PERSON> <PERSON> Mike </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Molloy </PERSON>, executive director of the state <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disaster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, said a survey team determined at mid-afternoon Friday that 20 percent of the caustic white phosphorus remained in the tanker. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, a DES spokesman, said plans called for placing the hull on a flat-bed rail car today and shipping it to a safe area to remove the remaining phosphorus. About 40 families displaced when the tanker derailed Wednesday night, creating a toxic cloud that forced the evacuation of 15,000 people from eight western <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> counties, will be allowed to return home once the car is removed, <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> conducted a drug test on the train's engineer, but the results will not be available for several weeks, said <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hensley </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hensley </PERSON> refused to identify the engineer. The tanker was part of a <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> train that officials say was going too fast through rural <LOCATION> Christian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> when 34 of its cars derailed Wednesday night in a ravine near <LOCATION> Crofton </LOCATION>. The phosphorus spilled from the ruptured tanker and burned for more than 12 hours after the crash. Phosphorus inside the tanker reignited Thursday night as workers righted it and although more toxic smoke billowed over the area, there were few additional evacuations and no injuries, officials said. The <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> engineer said he did not see a sign marking the section of the track under a slow order and did not receive a computer message about it, <PERSON> Hensley </PERSON> said. He said a warning marker was found, but was not standing. `` Our position is ... he failed to receive and comply with a 10 mph slow order,'' <PERSON> Hensley </PERSON> said. `` Whether the fault was on his part or our part, that really has n't been determined.'' He said the wreckage would be put through a battery of tests, including chemical and X-ray analyses, to determine if there were equipment or material failures. A tape located in the engineer's quarters, as well as handling and operational procedures, will also be reviewed, he said

 Poor mothers told a congressional committee investigating hunger in <LOCATION> Appalachia </LOCATION> that their families would not have enough food to live on if they did n't grow some of it themselves. Two congressmen, committee staff members and reporters visited homes of poor West Virginians on Friday before they listened to experts tell why some people go without food. `` The problems -LRB- with poverty programs -RRB- all originate with the notion that low-income people are deadbeats, lazy and shiftless people. This is not true,'' said <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogle </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Appalachian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> based in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>. Testifying before the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hunger </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Ogle </PERSON> said much of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s problem stems from the lack of money to supplement federal programs. That's because much of the state's wealth _ its surface land and mineral resources _ is controlled by out-of-state corporations. `` The absentee holders of wealth display an arrogance based on power that causes our state leaders to crumble and turn to mush,'' <PERSON> Ogle </PERSON> said. `` Thus, the burden of paying for public services falls disproportionately on low - and moderate-income people. The situation in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and other rural states appears to be dire, said Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>. `` We have heard from mothers in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> that they would not be able to adequately feed their families if they did n't have their gardens,'' said <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, the committee chairman. `` For many residents of this state, the outlook for prosperity in the near future is dismal. Most families do n't even think about how things look down the road because they are exhausting every thread of energy confronting the day-to-day struggles of making ends meet. But West Virginians are a proud people and they will stretch themselves to the farthest limits to survive.'' Earlier, the committee toured the homes of several residents to learn how they manage to make ends meet when state and federal programs are insufficient. <PERSON> Ocie </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, a 90-year-old resident of <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, told the congressmen she cherishes her independence but fears that it is threatened by her inability to make ends meet on Social Security, a modest <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> pension and the local Meals on Wheels program. `` When I get so I ca n't wait on myself, I hope the good Lord takes me,'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said. `` They want me to come live with my children, but I'd rather live in my own house.'' Down the road in <LOCATION> Robson </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gwendolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> is having an even harder time feeding herself and two children, her 3-year-old son and a 6-year-old girl she took in when the girl was abandoned by her mother. Because the little girl's mother is reluctant to allow her to be adopted, Cole _ who lives on $ 201 a month in welfare benefits and $ 228 a month in food stamps _ has been unable to obtain medical coverage for the child. `` What if she gets sick? I just pray that she do n't,'' <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said. Often, <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>'s food stamps do n't stretch nearly far enough. With nearly a week remaining before she gets her next allotment of stamps, she showed visitors a refrigerator virtually empty of anything except some bread and bottles of water that she has because her water pipes are broken. `` I was working, but now that I've got the kids I ca n't,'' said the single mother. The nearest available day care center is in <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, 20 miles away, and <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> has no transportation of her own. `` Whatever job I could get, I'd have to take the bus, and getting the kids to day care would be hard,'' she said.

<HEAD>Burma's Universities Shut In Wake Of Rioting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government has closed almost all universities and institutions of higher learning in this Southeast Asian nation after students rioted in at least four cities over the past week, local residents said today. <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, where rioting erupted Tuesday, was calm although traffic was lighter than normal today. A dusk-to-dawn curfew remained in force. Residents contacted by telephone said classes had been suspended at universities and secondary schools in <LOCATION> Mandalay </LOCATION>, the country's second largest city, as well as <LOCATION> Taunggyi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Moulmein </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pegu </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bassein </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Myitkyina </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Akyab </PERSON> The government imposed a series of restrictions hours after students and other demonstrators clashed with police in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> last Tuesday. Over the next few days the protests spread to <LOCATION> Pegu </LOCATION>, located north of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Moulmein </LOCATION>, on the southeastern seacoast, and the Irrawaddy delta center of <LOCATION> Bassein </LOCATION>. Residents in <LOCATION> Moulmein </LOCATION> said out-of-town students at the university were quickly sent home on buses, airplanes and boats by authorities. They also reported the arrest of several student leaders. There has been no comment to date on the disturbances in the government-controlled media and no public announcement since June 23 on the closure of the schools. Although details were not available, authorities in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> appeared to be searching for student leaders, most of whom have been expelled from schools and universities following a bloody riot in the capital last March. The latest protests were sparked by the government closure of the <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> where students last week staged a peaceful demonstration demanding release of arrested students and the legalization of student unions. Shouting anti-government slogans, thousands took to the streets and battled police with rocks. The government announced that nine persons were killed and 77 arrested in the third major violent protest since last October. The outbreak appears to reflect a widespread disillusionment with the 26-year-old regime of strongman Ne Win. His socialist economics have turned a once prosperous country into one of the world's poorest nations and the one-party rule has curtailed many civil liberties. The stagnant economy has created widespread unemployment or under-employment among university graduates, who spearheaded the week's anti-government drive. The 78-year-old Ne Win came to power in a 1962 coup and has since ousted a number of potential rivals. But until last year, overt, mass opposition had been sporadic with the last major protests prior to October occuring in 1974. The government has said that the curfew as well as a ban on public meetings and demonstrations would last until Aug. 19. It has not said when classes would be resumed.

<TEXT>
 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> has been using his Austrian visit to emphasize that Christians as well as Jews were among the victims of Nazi persecution. Shortly after arriving in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> on Thursday afternoon, the pontiff began drawing attention to the non-Jews who suffered under <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> dictator <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>. The pontiff did not mention Jews during his formal, televised speech during a Friday afternoon visit to the site of the former <ORGANIZATION> Mauthausen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> death camp, angering <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s chief rabbi by the omission. Today, the pontiff again brought up Christian suffering during a prayer service in the town of <LOCATION> Lorch </LOCATION>, 25 miles from the Czech border. `` Not far from here is <LOCATION> Mauthausen </LOCATION>, where Christians, Jews and others were persecuted for many reaons, including their religion, `` the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said. `` Their suffering was a gift to the world. `` In addition to killing six million Jews, the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> also killed hundred of thousand of others, including gypsies, homosexuals, priests and political opponents On his five-day Austrian tour, the pope appeared to be trying to make sure the memories of the other victims, especially Christians, are not forgotten. `` Amongst the many who were persecuted for religious, racial and political reasons were large numbers of Catholics _ priests, members of religious orders and lay people,'' he told President <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> and other Austrian politicians Thursday evening. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> also brought up the issue in a meeting with leaders of <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s Jewish community Friday morning as he talked about inquiries into the causes of the Nazi dictatorship. The pope spoke of studies into the `` the Holocaust as well as martyrdom of the Polish people and other European peoples during the Nazi era.'' Many of the Poles who were killed _ though not all _ were Jews. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> reminded the Jewish community leaders that the Nazi machine was aimed not only at the Jewish people `` but also against the faith of those who worship <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nazareth </LOCATION>, a Jew, as the savior of the world.'' Then, in an emotional visit to the site of the former death camp on Friday afternoon, the only victims he mentioned by name were Polish priest <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maximilian </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolbe </PERSON>, religious activist <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Callo </PERSON> and two other Catholics. He also called attention to `` all people, especially those who, when World War II was raging in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, suffered the torture of such camps.'' Austrian chief Rabbi <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenberg </PERSON> responded to the <LOCATION> Mauthausen </LOCATION> speech by saying: `` A visit to <LOCATION> Mauthausen </LOCATION> without mentioning the word ` Jews' once is not satisfactory.'' `` The only Jew he mentions who suffered is <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>, and he did n't die in <LOCATION> Mauthausen </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Eisenberg </PERSON> added. The pontiff's pronouncements come as some historians have been promoting revised views of the Holocaust and <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> atrocities. Conservative West German historians in particular are saying that Nazi horrors should be compared with Stalinist-era mass killings in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and similar atrocities by totalitarian regimes. The historians' views have angered many Jews, who say they are denigrating the memory of Jews who died in the Holocaust. It is not known whether the pope is versed in this historical debate. However, after condemning the Nazi atrocities at <LOCATION> Mauthausen </LOCATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> used the phrase: `` Here ... and in so many places under totalitarian rule.'' Later in the speech, he added: `` If a machine of destruction still exists anywhere in the world, tell us, what can our century pass on to the generations to come?''

<HEAD>Thunderstorms Blow Down Barns, Power Lines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 A band of powerful thunderstorms sped eastward across part of the drought-battered <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> today after unleashing a tornado and blowing down a barn as record heat cooked <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> to East. The storms pushing across parts of the eastern <LOCATION> Dakotas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> into northern <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and western <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> prompted severe thunderstorm watches in the latter two states. Scattered showers and thunderstorms weakened from east <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and northeast <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, also suffering from the drought, and widely scattered thunderstorms lingered over southern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and western <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. Scattered showers and thunderstorms extended from northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and the southern <LOCATION> Rockies </LOCATION> and from south central <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and western <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>. On Friday, the storms triggered a tornado just southeast of <LOCATION> Claire </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, downed power lines there and left eight-tenths of an inch of rain. In <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, strong winds blew down a barn in De <PERSON> Graff </PERSON> and toppled trees in <LOCATION> Roseau </LOCATION>. Golf ball-size hail pounded <LOCATION> Brainerd </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ellendale </LOCATION>, and smaller hail fell in or near other cities. In <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, thunderstorm winds blew part of a roof off a house near <LOCATION> Uvalda </LOCATION>, knocked down a barn near <LOCATION> Eastman </LOCATION>, and downed power lines south of <LOCATION> Forsyth </LOCATION> and trees in <LOCATION> Ailey </LOCATION> and west of <LOCATION> Thomaston </LOCATION>. Three-fourths of an inch of rain fell in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> in an hour. Showers and thunderstorms diminished Friday night across the <LOCATION> southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, also seared by drought. In the late afternoon and evening, 2 -LCB- inches of rain soaked <LOCATION> Broken </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, and nearly an inch fell in <LOCATION> Maud </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Streets in and around <LOCATION> Laredo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, flooded. Temperature records up to 87 years old were shattered or tied in 43 cities from <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, with the mercury over 100 degrees in 25 of those cities. It was a sizzling 110 degrees in <LOCATION> Valentine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, torching the record for the date of 99 degrees set in 1917 and tying the all-time high. Other records included 109 degrees in <LOCATION> Huron </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, -LRB- 99, 1923 -RRB-; 101 in Minneapolis-St. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> -LRB- 99, 1952 -RRB-; and 103 in <LOCATION> Paducah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION> -LRB- 99, 1952 -RRB- <LOCATION> Bullhead </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, had the nation's high with 114 degrees. Today's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms from southern <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> to lower <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and the eastern Great Lakes to much of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, with thunderstorms most numerous near the Canadian border from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>; scattered thunderstorms from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> to the lower <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> and much of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, with thunderstorms most numerous along the central <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and southeast <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; and thunderstorms in much of the <ORGANIZATION> Rockies </ORGANIZATION> and parts of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. High temperatures were forecast in the 90s to near 100 degrees over most of the nation; near 105 degrees in parts of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, eastern <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>; near 115 degress in parts of the desert <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION>; in the 70s and 80s from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, with some 60s in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, and from northern <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>; and in the 60s and 70s along the <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coasts.

The man then moved over to another apartment, where a resident heard the commotion and called the doorman, who called police. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s backpack contained jewelry, foreign currency and silver dollars, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said, apparently all taken from the second apartment.

<TEXT>
 A lawyer arrived home today after he was expelled by <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION> as he tried to represent chiefs charged with plotting to form a new government and other men accused of gun smuggling. Attorney <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Harder </PERSON>, 39, was deported from the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION> and flown to <LOCATION> Auckland </LOCATION> about 1,300 miles to the south. He said he had been held by the Fijian military for three days. He went to the archipelago to represent eight chiefs from the island of <LOCATION> Rotuma </LOCATION> charged with plotting to break away from the central government. Sources in <PERSON> Rotuma </PERSON> said men had plotted in May to declare <PERSON> Rotuma </PERSON>'s secession from <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION>, a British colony until 1970. Harder also intended to act as attorney for five men of Indian descent charged after the discovery of Soviet-made weapons on <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION> earlier this month. He said he had arrived Monday and attempted the next day to arrange a meeting with Fijian military leader Lt. Col. <PERSON> Sitiveni </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabuka </PERSON>. But his calls went unanswered, he said. On Wednesday morning, he said two plain-clothes security men arrested him at his hotel and drove him to the army barracks. He said he was not mistreated by authorities. Harder did not say whether he had been given an explanation for his detention and deportation. However, he was arrested after he wrote a letter to the local judiciary objecting to a new security decree that affected his clients. The measures, imposed Wednesday, allow mandatory life imprisonment for arms smuggling, detention without trial for up to four years, sweeping powers of arrest and search, and restriction of freedom of expression. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> on Friday attacked the measures, saying <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION> had become the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>'s first police state. There has been unrest among the majority Indian population of <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION> following two coups carried out last year by <PERSON> Rabuka </PERSON>, an ethnic Fijian who said he intended to ensure the rights of his people. Ethnic Fijians are outnumbered by Indians in the 715,000 population of the island nation. The five men whom Harder wanted to represent are among 21 Fijians of Indian descent, some businessmen, charged after the weapons _ including hand grenades, machine guns and missile launchers _ were found. An Australian newspaper has reported that the cache was part of a plan to overthrow <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION>'s government by shipping arms to its Indian community.

<TEXT>
 A man who has been arrested 11 times on drunken driving charges since 1978 was sentenced to jail for the first time _ for reckless driving. Traffic Court Judge <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Trent </PERSON> on Thursday revoked <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>'s probation from a reckless driving conviction on April 12 and ordered him to serve 90 days in jail <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, 33, had been given a 90-day suspended sentence after the city attorney's office agreed to allow him to plead guilty to a reduced charge of reckless driving. He was arrested Feb. 2 on charges of driving while intoxicated. Prosecutors said they did not take <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> to court on the earlier DWI charge because <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> had refused to take any breath or field sobriety tests, leaving prosecutors with insufficient evidence. <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>'s lawyer had assured the court that his client would place himself in an institution for drug rehabilitation as a condition of the reckless driving conviction. But testimony Thursday indicated <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> had failed to do so. Since 1978, <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> has been arrested 11 times for DWI but has been convicted only once following a 1982 accident on the <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> in which two people were injured. He also faces trial on DWI charges stemming from arrests on May 17 and June 6.

 A 6-year-old rust-colored dog named <PERSON> Rosie </PERSON> got plaques and flowers and all the dog biscuits she could eat after being honored by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for saving the life of her owner. `` She thinks it's some kind of big party,'' said owner <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, who has been paralyzed from the neck down since a 1953 polio attack and depends on an iron lung to breath. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, 58, was sleeping in an iron lung when a power failure on March 27 shut down the machine and the auxillary generator failed to kick in. With the electricity out, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> was unable to get help. `` I realized the only thing I had was <PERSON> Rosie </PERSON>,'' she said Friday. <PERSON> Rosie </PERSON>, who was sleeping one room away, heard her owner's calls for help and barked until <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>'s brother-in-law, asleep upstairs, came down and connected batteries to the iron lung. `` It does n't sound like the most unusual, heroic thing the world has ever seen,'' said <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Potter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Animals </ORGANIZATION>, which nominated <PERSON> Rosie </PERSON> for the honor. `` But she does n't bark on command.

 Delegates returned to U.S.-mediated talks today in an effort to bridge deep differences over how to achieve peace in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The delegates from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> faced widely divergent proposals presented in Friday's opening session, conference sources said The participants are seeking a formula for ending a 13-year civil war in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and ushering in independence to <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, or <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. The leading <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Al-Ahram </ORGANIZATION> reported today that the Cubans offered to withdraw their troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> over four years, but that the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION> wanted a pullout in eight months. The South Africans and the joint Angolan-Cuban delegation consulted separately Friday night with <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistant secretary of state for <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> affairs. <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON> is acting as mediator. In keeping with a news blackout imposed Friday, the sources said nothing about whether <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON>'s consultations brought the positions closer for today's second and final day of negotiations. Two previous rounds of peace talks, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brazzaville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION>, failed to achieve settlements last month. The conference sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said today's one-hour morning session was meant to enable the opposing sides to reply formally to each other's proposals. The delegates also agreed to hold an afternoon meeting. South African Foreign Minister R.F. `` Pik'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> told reporters after the morning session: `` We had good, excellent talks.'' But under the blackout, he and other delegates refused to discuss substance. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> told reporters Friday that his government was insisting on Cuban troop withdrawal from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> as a prerequisite for Namibian independence. At the negotiating table on Friday, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> demanded that <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> set a date for pulling out its more than 50,000 troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, the conference sources said. South African sources have spoken of a reciprocal military buildup near the border between <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, with the Cubans deploying 15,000-17 ,000 troops and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> calling up reserves <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> is demanding an end to South African military and logistical support for Angolan rebels of <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>, which has been fighting the Marxist central government in <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION>, also obtains arms from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>REYKJAVIK, Iceland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two candidates vied for the presidency of <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION> in today's election and opinion polls predicted a landslide victory for incumbent Vigdis Finnbogadottir. Some of the 170,000 eligible voters on this sparsely populated island cast ballots shortly after polls opened at 9 a.m. -LRB- 5 a.m. EDT -RRB-. Polls close at 11 p.m. -LRB- 7 p.m. EDT -RRB-, with results expected one hour later. The presidency is largely ceremonial. Real power rests with the prime minister, <PERSON> Thorsteinn </PERSON> <PERSON> Palsson </PERSON>. The challenger, 46-year-old housewife <PERSON> Sigrun </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorsteinsdottir </PERSON>, captured eve-of-election headlines when her Friday afternoon rally in the Icelandic capital was disrupted by a bomb scare. Police said they received an anonymous telephone call claiming that a bomb had been planted in <LOCATION> Laekjartorg </LOCATION>, the main square in downtown <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION>, where about 100 supporters and spectators had gathered. Police searched the square but no bomb was found. Recent opinion polls suggest Mrs. <PERSON> Thorsteinsdottir </PERSON> will secure less than 3 percent of the vote. Ms. <PERSON> Finnbogadottir </PERSON>, 57, is campaigning for a third four-year term. She defeated three male candidates in 1980 to become the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> island's fourth president and the world's first female state president. In 1984, she won automatic re-election when no rivals registered. Today's election marks the first time an incumbent president has faced a re-election challenge since this nation of 243,000 became a republic in 1944. Mrs. <PERSON> Thorsteinsdottir </PERSON> is a member of the anti-establishment <ORGANIZATION> Humanist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which has so far failed to win a seat in the 63-seat Althing, or parliament. She has challenged Ms. Finnbogadottir's role as a figurehead president with traditionally limited powers, arguing that the constitution apportions far greater power on the presidency than commonly supposed. But constitutional experts say that although the president has power to introduce bills to the legislature, form governments and subject proposed legislation to a plebiscite, the constitution makes clear that the prime minister and the Cabinet are solely responsible for all government action. All the major political party leaders have expressed support for the status quo and some have ventured to suggest that Mrs. <PERSON> Thorsteinsdottir </PERSON>'s campaign is based on ignorance of the constitution. Icelandic women have in recent years begun to carve out a larger slice of political power. The left-wing Women's Alliance _ which made history in 1983 when it became the first feminist movement in the world to win parliamentary seats _ doubled its tally to six seats in last year's general election. The <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION> daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Morgunbladid </ORGANIZATION> recently published a poll showing the opposition Women's Alliance equal with the <ORGANIZATION> Independence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, with each enjoying the support of about 30 percent of the electorate. The Independence Party is the country's largest political party and a dominant force in the three-party coalition government,

<HEAD>Treatment for Hypertension Could Increase Heart Attack Risk</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Medication sometimes prescribed to lower high blood pressure in younger patients paradoxically may increase the risk of heart attack by harming blood fat levels, researchers say. High blood pressure can be accompanied by abnormal blood fat levels that, left undetected and untreated, could pose a greater danger than hypertension, Dr. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. Two types of drugs commonly used to treat hypertension _ diuretics and beta blockers _ often adversely affect the relationship among the three blood fats: high-density lipoprotein cholesterol or `` good'' cholesterol; triglycerides; and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol or `` bad'' cholesterol, he said. The three are the components of total blood cholesterol. Cholesterol is manufactured by the body and necessary for building cells, making hormones and helping digestion. But in excess, it is a contributor to fatty build-up in blood vessels that can lead to heart attacks. High blood pressure, which afflicts about 20 percent of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> adults, is a leading cause of heart attack and stroke. But by giving hypertensive patients with abnormal blood fat levels diuretics and beta blockers, doctors may be further knocking the proportion among the three blood fats out of line and contributing to the risk of heart attack, the researcher said. `` The level of abnormality of lipids puts them at much greater risk of heart attack than high blood pressure,'' said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, director of the university's <ORGANIZATION> Cardiovascular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Genetics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION>. `` The point is that doctors are getting their -LRB- patients' -RRB- high blood pressure treated, but their underlying lipid -LRB- blood fat -RRB- abnormalities are not being treated,'' he said. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and fellow researchers found high levels of bad cholesterol and triglycerides and low levels of good cholesterol in many of the subjects they studied while they were looking for inherited factors in high blood pressure. The team reported its findings in Friday's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Their study used sets of siblings diagnosed with high blood pressure, all of whom had received treatment before the age of 60. Of a total of 131 subjects, 69 had abnormalities in cholesterol and triglyceride levels in addition to their high blood pressure. But only three of those 69 were getting treated for the blood fat abnormalities, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. `` Unfortunately, that's not surprising,'' said Dr. R.W. <PERSON> Wissler </PERSON>, a noted cardiovascular pathologist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's only been a few years since doctors learned about any relationship between anti-hypertensives and the lipids, and it is just now being reported in more detail,'' he said. `` Things sometimes build up slowly in medicine, which makes it all the more important that this be given more attention.''

 Workers chipping away at old floor tiles in the hallway of a suburban high school sent clouds of dust containing cancer-causing asbestos into the air, federal officials charged. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> lodged a complaint and proposed a $ 5,000 fine against <ORGANIZATION> Thornton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Township </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Harvey </LOCATION>, a spokeswoman said Friday. It is the first complaint the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has brought under new asbestos-safety rules that went into effect in December. The complaint says students and other school personnel were exposed to asbestos fibers during the improper removal of 6,400 square feet of hallway flooring. `` We had received several calls from teachers and students and actually the workers in the school that the tile was being removed in the hallway and clouds of dust were being raised, and they were very concerned about it,'' said <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>. School officials have until July 11 to respond to the complaint, which names <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> High School District 205. The school was closed Friday afternoon, and officials could not be reached for comment. The violations were discovered during an <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> inspection March 1, and the school immediately discontinued the flooring removal project at the agency's request, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said. Asbestos, a mineral that has been used in building materials, can cause lung cancer and other disorders when airborne fibers enter the body. When the tile was removed in February, school officials did not initially know that it contained asbestos, Ms. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. Later, officials had the tile tested and the presence of asbestos was confirmed, she said. Workers who were not accredited by the government to remove asbestos `` had sanded, chipped and cut the tiles, releasing clouds of dust containing asbestos,'' the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said in a news release. The complaint against <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> is the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s first enforcement action nationwide under the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act, the agency said. Under the law, which took effect Dec. 14, specific safety measures must be taken when removing asbestos from elementary and secondary schools. If they decide to contest the complaint, school officials can seek an informal hearing with <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> or request a hearing before a federal administrative law judge, Ms. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said.

 A bomb ripped apart a three-story hotel in the center of the old city, killing 13 people and wounding four others, police said. Police said four of the dead were Afghan nationals. <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, assistant inspector of crimes, said the blast was set off by an 11-pound explosive device. It tore through the second and third floors of the hotel after sunrise, as Moslems were finishing their morning prayers. The hotel `` collapsed just like a sandwich,'' <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> said. He said two people died on the way to the hospital after surviving nine hours beneath the rubble. Among the dead were an Afghan woman and her 3-year-old child who had come to <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION> for medical treatment, according to <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Amer </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Pakistani </LOCATION> journalist. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast, but police said they suspected agents of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s communist government. `` Previously, they have committed all these things,'' <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> said, referring to dozens of terrorist bombings over the past two years in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Hundreds of Pakistanis and Afghan refugees have died in the blasts. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> backs Moslem insurgents fighting the Afghan government, which is backed by Soviet forces who are withdrawing after an eight-year involvement in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s civil war. <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>, 30 miles from the Afghan border, is headquarters of the seven-party guerrilla alliance. On Friday, small explosive devices went off outside the headquarters of two of the rebel groups but there were no serious injuries, <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> said.

As nearly 1,000 friends, relatives and students crowded onto an athletic field for Eastside's 102nd graduation Friday, <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> described the pain of poverty he experienced as youth in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> and how it motivated him. `` Regardless of the vicissitudes, regardless of the difficulties, I declare that this little brat welfare boy from <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> was not going to give up and he was going to go to the pinnacle of success,'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, who in the past few months has appeared on the cover of <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, received a job offer from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and inspired an upcoming <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> movie about his tough ways, struck a chord with the departing seniors. `` I'm going to miss him,'' said <PERSON> Diedra </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bethea </PERSON>, 17, who plans to study chemistry at <ORGANIZATION> Trenton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. `` He's just like a father to me.'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> has been credited with bringing law and order to a rowdy inner-city school and was held up as an example of a tough urban educator by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. He banned underachieving students, chained doors shut to drug-dealers and strode the halls with a bullhorn and baseball bat. But the <PERSON> Paterson </PERSON> school board considered disciplinary action against <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> for kicking out more than 60 students without going through proper procedures, though it eventually dropped its effort. Even the movie film crew's presence at the school drew controversy. `` We learned something from it,'' said <PERSON> Erving </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON>, 18, referring to the disputes. `` You have to go to battle sometimes.'' The principal lauded the students and told them the success of <LOCATION> Paterson </LOCATION> rests in their hands. `` We have pricked the conscience of a nation and we have shown, if nothing more, that black and Hispanic students in inner cities can behave properly,'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. Several parents at the graduation praised the principal. `` He's put the school back on its feet,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who graduated from Eastside two decades ago and whose daughter, LaVetta, will attend <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> in the fall to study engineering.

 Arab protesters clashed with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers outside a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> mosque and pelted a police van with stones in <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, witnesses said. Police arrested nine people and closed two Arab schools. In the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> youth was wounded in the leg when troops opened fire to disperse stone-throwers in the casbah, or Arab marketplace, the army said. The youth was not identified. The clash followed Friday's incident in which a Jewish settler fired on Palestinians who stoned his car in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, wounding seven people. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>, soldiers fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse about 200 Moslem fundamentalists who protested after a meeting at a nearby mosque, Israeli witnesses said. No injuries were reported. In east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, dozens of police vehicles and policemen in riot gear, some carrying tear gas launchers, patrolled the streets and stood guard at the entrances to the walled <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio reported that nine Palestinians were detained after the scattered stone-throwing incidents in east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. Several youths hurled stones at a police van and a private car, but there were no injuries. Also today, police closed two Arab private schools. <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> police spokesman <PERSON> Rafi </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said the closure followed stone-throwing attacks on police in which students took part. Police have linked renewed tension in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> to the latest leaflet put out by underground leaders of the 6 -LCB- - month Arab uprising The leaflet called on the Arabs to intensify protests in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and challenge Israeli rule of the city. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured the eastern part of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. On Friday, angry Jewish settlers demanded the mass expulsion of Palestinians and blamed the army for failing to protect them after an American-born settler was stabbed in the back by a Palestinian. `` We must throw out a couple of thousand Arabs,'' said <PERSON> Elyakim </PERSON> <PERSON> Haetzni </PERSON>, a right-wing Israeli lawyer and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> settler. `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> ca n't dry the swamp by swatting a mosquito or two.'' <PERSON> Yohan </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaikeh </PERSON>, a computer programmer from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> who now lives in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, was attacked Friday while shopping before the Jewish Sabbath in the city's Arab marketplace. He suffered stab wounds in the shoulder and lower back. <PERSON> Chaikeh </PERSON>, 33, pulled out his gun, chased his assailant about 50 yards and shot him in the elbow, said <PERSON> Zeev </PERSON> <PERSON> Hever </PERSON>, a Jewish leader in <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, about 20 miles south of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. About 200 Israelis live among the city's 80,000 Arabs. He was reported later in stable condition at <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hadassah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Chaiken </PERSON>'s assailant was also said to be in stable condition at <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Alia </PERSON> hospital. He was identified as <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Majid </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharawneh </PERSON>, 22, from the nearby village of <LOCATION> Dura </LOCATION>. The stabbing marked the second serious attack on an Israeli in less than a week. On Sunday, an Israeli farmer was stabbed and bludgeoned to death, bringing to four the number of Israelis killed since the Arab uprising began Dec. 8. So far, 211 Palestinians have died. The army immediately closed <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION> to traffic and clamped a curfew on the marketplace area. <PERSON> Chaiken </PERSON>, who emigrated to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> four years ago, was identified by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> televison as an activist of American-born Rabbi <PERSON> Meir </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON>'s anti-Arab <ORGANIZATION> Kach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. In other violence Friday, an Israeli couple opened fire on young Palestinians who stoned their car in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television filmed the incident and later showed the bearded settler firing at the Arabs. Officials at the city's <LOCATION> Al </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ittihad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> said seven Arabs, including two 8-year-old boys, were hit by bullets, all in the arms or legs. An army spokesman said the settler's car was stoned outside the central <PERSON> Mazuz </PERSON> <PERSON> Masri </PERSON> mosque after noon prayers. The settler got out and fired an Uzi submachine gun, and his female companion fired as well, the spokesman said.

 A man claiming to suffer from amnesia, who was arrested on murder charges after a newspaper publicized his plight, now says he remembers his real name. `` I am Mr. <PERSON> Peabody </PERSON>. I remembered,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Peabody </PERSON> said outside a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, courtroom Thursday after he was turned over to <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> detectives for transfer to <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. When asked when he remembered his real name and how much else he recalled, <PERSON> Peabody </PERSON> said, `` I do n't have any other comment.'' His attorney, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Coyne </PERSON>, also would n't comment. <PERSON> Peabody </PERSON> was arraigned in <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Friday in connection with the death last month of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Capuano </PERSON>, 34, in a <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> inn where both men had been staying.

He gave his name as <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, told of being born in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in 1944 but said he did n't remember his more recent past. A story about `` Anderson'' published in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Standard-Times </LOCATION> on June 18 led police to investigate and resulted in <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION>'s arrest Wednesday. <PERSON> Capuano </PERSON>'s bullet-ridden body was found wrapped in green garbage bags in <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION>'s room at a <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> inn May 31.

<TEXT>
 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> today paid tribute to Jewish and other victims of <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s most notorious <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> concentration camp, saying `` their suffering was a gift to the world.'' The Roman Catholic leader spoke after Jewish leaders criticized his formal speech the day before during a visit to the site of the former <LOCATION> Mauthausen </LOCATION> camp, where thousands of Jews were among the 110,000 inmates who perished. The speech omitted any specific reference to Jews. The criticism prompted <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> to tell reporters today that the pontiff had no intention of slighting the Jews. <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> said the pontiff mentioned the Jews who died at <LOCATION> Mauthausen </LOCATION> during a brief stop at a memorial plaque set up in their memory. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> spoke before 80,000 people today in the town of <LOCATION> Lorch </LOCATION>, just 25 miles from the Czechoslovak border, on the third day of his visit to <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. `` Not far from here is <LOCATION> Mauthausen </LOCATION>, where Christians, Jews and others were persecuted for many reasons, including their religion,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said, referring to his visit to the concentration camp site. He continued: `` Their suffering was a gift to the world.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> has been using the current, five-day <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> trip to discuss various aspects of the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> past. The country is marking the 50th anniversary year of its annexation by <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in 1938. After his arrival Thursday, the pontiff, despite protests of some Jewish leaders, met with controversial President <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>. The Austrian president has faced allegations of complicity in Nazi war crimes but has denied wrongdoing. On Friday, <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> received Holy Communion from the pontiff during an outdoor Mass for 80,000 people in the town of <LOCATION> Trausdorf </LOCATION> near the border with <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Lorch </LOCATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> also addressed the concerns of workers and farmers in the area. Many of the farmers in the far northern region are having trouble staying in business, often forced to take second jobs to make ends meet. `` The church stands by you when you have social and economic problems,'' the white-robed pontiff said during the outdoor prayer service. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> frequently has called for respect for workers' rights and warned about the potential dangers of unbridled, profit-motivated capitalism. The Polish-born pontiff set off a wave of Jewish protest Friday when he failed to mention Jews during the <LOCATION> Mauthausen </LOCATION> speech. `` The failure of Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> to make any specific reference to the suffering of the Jews while visiting the site of the infamous <LOCATION> Mauthausen </LOCATION> concentration camp is a matter of deep shock to the Jewish community,'' said <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> executive director <PERSON> Elan </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>. `` This, together with the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>'s unwillingness to confront <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> over his <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> past or address the historical complicity of <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> in the crimes of <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, are failures that constitute a tragic lost moral opportunity,'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> added in a statement from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Also faulting the pontiff on Friday was <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s chief rabbi <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenberg </PERSON>, who leads the country's 12,000 Jews. On Friday while at <LOCATION> Mauthausen </LOCATION>, the pontiff cited only four concentration camp victims by name, all of them Catholics. However, he stopped in silence for nearly a minute at a plaque set up in memory of the Jewish victims. <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> said the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>, standing beside a camp survivor in front of the plaque, spoke of the Jews and said `` never again'' three times. <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> said the survivor was supposed to have been wearing a tiny microphone so that the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>'s words could have been heard but that for some reason officials had removed the device.

 A security guard apparently frustrated with his job shot six workers at a water purification equipment company, killing two and leaving one in critical condition, police said. <PERSON> Sebron </PERSON> <PERSON> Flenaugh </PERSON>, 45, of <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, was arrested without incident at a house in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, about 25 miles west of here, three hours after the shootings Friday evening, according to <ORGANIZATION> Concord </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>. He said <PERSON> Flenaugh </PERSON> would be booked for investigation of murder and five counts of assault with a deadly weapon. Several employees of <PERSON> Micropure </PERSON> said they heard <PERSON> Flenaugh </PERSON> say, `` This is a lousy job'' or `` This is a crummy job,'' as he moved through the one-story building gunning down terrified workers. `` Everybody was screaming and running,'' said <PERSON> Germaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON>, 17, who was in the shipping room when the gunfire broke out. `` I hit the ground and went under the table.'' Employees said <PERSON> Flenaugh </PERSON>, who was not supposed to be armed on duty, `` seemed depressed during the past couple of days -LRB- but the employees knew -RRB- of nothing to indicate why,'' according to <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>. The gunman entered the Micropure building about 6:30 p.m. Friday from a rear parking lot, walked onto the loading dock, and suddenly opened fire on employees, said <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>. Three employees were wounded on the dock before the attacker entered the lunch room and shot two more people. A sixth person was shot just outside the room. One of the victims, <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollis </PERSON>, 17, of <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, died about 11 p.m. Friday from wounds to the abdomen and chest, said <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Muir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Walnut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Disney </PERSON>, 19, of <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION>, who was hit in the stomach, died at 4 a.m., the hospital said. Three other victims were seriously injured, and one of those was listed in critical condition early today. The sixth victim suffered a superficial wound on the back. Three victims were taken to <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Muir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in this community about 25 miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said. The others were taken to nearby <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diablo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Flenaugh </PERSON> had worked for the last 18 months as a guard at <LOCATION> Micropure </LOCATION>, a distributor of water treatment equipment for household use. Employees described him as congenial but added that he was often serious, and declined invitations to go out.

<HEAD>Jackson, Dukakis Agree To Overhaul Party Rules</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> have agreed to overhaul <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> rules for 1992, eliminating provisions that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said prevented him from getting as many delegates as he deserved, a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spokesman said today. The changes include cutting the number of super delegates by nearly half, and requiring that all other delegates in all states be awarded to presidential candidates in proportion to the votes they receive. The agreement between the two campaigns virtually assures that the proposed changes would be ratified by the party's national convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> next month. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign spokesman <PERSON> Tad </PERSON> <PERSON> Devine </PERSON> said that the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor would have won the nomination even if those proposed rules were in place this year. `` The reason that <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is the nominee of the party is he was the overwhelming choice of the voters,'' said <PERSON> Devine </PERSON>, who is in charge of delegate selection for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' presidential campaign. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had complained that the rules which allowed party leaders and elected officials to hold automatic seats as national convention super delegates were unfair. Of the 643 super delegates to the convention, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is supported by 362 while <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has just 55, according to The Associated Press delegate count. In addition, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said that some states which hold direct election of delegates and others which weight the process toward the overall winner do not hand out delegates fairly. The proposed changes would require all of the states to adopt rules that would award delegates proportionally. If adopted by the rules committee and ratified by the national convention, the rules would take effect in 1992. <PERSON> Devine </PERSON> said that the agreement between the two campaigns was reached after several days of negotiations. He said it represented compromise on both sides.

 Almost one-third of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s labor force may lose their jobs as a result of the government's economic austerity program, a trade union leader was quoted as saying <PERSON> Dusan </PERSON> <PERSON> Koceljevic </PERSON> made the statement during a session of a government commission which is preparing economic reforms, the <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Politika </ORGANIZATION> reported.

As a result, wage cuts of up to 30 percent have been enforced under the new measure. `` Because of the restructuring of the economy, 2 million workers will lose their jobs,'' <PERSON> Koceljevic </PERSON> was quoted as saying.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> hailed his final economic summit as a triumph for his long-held, free-market philosophy, but in one key respect his current policy is radically different from the early days of his administration. The president who once was content to sit idly by while the dollar soared in value has become an active meddler in currency markets _ anathema in the early days of Reagonomics. Then the cry was: `` Let the markets decide'' the fair exchange value of the dollar, left untouched by government. But the final economic communique issued after the <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> summit by the leaders of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britian </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> brags that their policy of joint intervention has been a success and should be continued. Intervention is the process by which countries buy and sell currencies on the open market in an effort to influence their price. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his first <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>, disdained such actions during the president's first term, contending that the dollar's surge in value during those years was a sign of economic strength. The administration turned a deaf ear to pleas from American manufacturers and farmers who contended that they were being battered by an over-valued dollar which had made their goods uncompetitive on world markets. At the dollar's highest point in February 1985, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> replied that the greenback's strength `` was n't a problem. It was a blessing,'' demonstrating how attractive the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was to foreign investors. Critics contended that this hands-off policy was eroding <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s industrial base and bringing on record trade deficits as American manufacturers and farmers were priced out of more and more foreign markets. Treasury Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, who replaced <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> in early 1985, decided that with protectionist forces gaining the upper hand in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, it was time for a new approach. The change turned out to be a surprise announcement by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its major allies in September 1985 at the Plaza Hotel in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that they would jointly intervene in currency markets to drive the dollar lower in an effort to make American products competitive once again. `` The administration changed views quite radically because of the near-recession in certain sectors of the economy in late 1984 and 1985,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` They went to work to fix the problems in trade, manufacturing and farming.'' Since that time, the dollar has fallen by 50 percent against the Japanese yen and German mark and by somewhat smaller margins against other currencies. The effort began to pay off in the middle of 1986 as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports in volume terms started improving even though the trade deficit in dollar terms continued to worsen because the weaker dollar made imports more expensive. But after posting a record deficit of $ 170.3 billion in 1987, the deficit for the first four months of this year has declined sharply to an annual rate of $ 141.8 billion. With that improvement has come a surge in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> growth rate, as manufacturing companies have been busy hiring to meet the increased export demands. In February 1987, the summit nations switched from a policy of trying to drive the dollar lower to one of stabilizing the dollar for fear that any further decline would threaten a resurgence of inflation in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and frighten away the foreign investors the country has come to depend on. For most of last year that effort was a failure as market forces continued to push the dollar lower. The dollar's continued decline forced the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to step in and tighten interest rates to prevent a surge in inflation. This combination of a weak currency and rising interest rates has been blamed in a part for the October stock market collapse. The market crash, raising fears of a global recession, convinced the summit countries of the critical need for stronger efforts at stabilizing the dollar's value. They issued a Dec. 22 communique pledging closer cooperation and that, so far, has done the trick. In the <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> economic communique, the countries repeated their pledge for close economic coordination, building on commitments made at the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> summit in 1986 and the <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> summit last year. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said he believed the coordination process has proved so successful that it would last long after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was out of office. But some critics are not so sure, contending that policy squabbles are inevitable when dealing with sovereign nations. `` The notion of coordination is something we keep talking about, but it does n't really exist. No country is willing to be lectured to by the other side,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>, an economist at the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> think tank. `` What we really have is a heavy open-mouth policy -LRB- on the part of government officials -RRB- providing guidance to the markets and that has been backed up by intervention.'' <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> said that this fragile arrangement can come apart at any time with the resultant discord jolting markets as it did last October. But President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and the other world leaders concluded their gathering on a more upbeat note, praising the `` strengthened ties of solidarity, both political and economic,'' between them.

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> magazine reported today that the Iranian government hopes to influence the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidential elections by releasing British hostages close to the Nov. 8 vote. The weekly Ash-Shiraa reported that the agreement to release the hostages emerged during a three-day unofficial visit by four British legislators to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> that ended Wednesday. `` Reliable Moslem fundamentalist circles have confirmed that British-Iranian negotiations to free British hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> will result -LRB- in their release -RRB- on the eve of the American presidential elections,'' the report said. The magazine gained international fame when it broke the story of secret <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in return for releasing American hostages in 1986. The magazine's more recent reports on hostage developments have proved inaccurate. The four British legislators returned to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Wednesday saying <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> officials offered to use their influence to release the three British captives in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ash-Shiraa </PERSON> said the `` Iranian leadersip was seeking to postpone the release until late summer so that it will be the biggest voter in the coming <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidential elections.'' <PERSON> Ash-Shiraa </PERSON> said the Iranian move of postponing the release `` aims at besieging and embarrassing the official <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> stand -LRB- of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration -RRB-'' for failing to obtain the release of American hostages. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> had agreed not to negotiate for the hostages' release. However, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> `` negotiated with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for the release of French hostages and that was achieved'' the report said. French diplomats <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Carton </PERSON> as well as journalist <PERSON> Jean-Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON> were released in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> May 4. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s foreign secretary, Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>, on Thursday denied that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> was negotiating for the release of <ORGANIZATION> Anglican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> envoy <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>, journalist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> and teacher <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON>. No group has claimed responsibility for abducting <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> and <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, although they are widely believed held by fanatic Shiite Moslem kidnappers affiliated with the Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God. The magazine report compared the anticipated release to that of of 52 Americans held hostage in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> for 444 days. They were released on inauguration day as president <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> left office. `` The aim of the delay was to bring <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> down and the hostages were only released after a new president -LRB- President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> -RRB- took over'' the magazine article concluded. In all, 18 foreigners are missing and believed kidnapped in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, including nine Americans. The longest held is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

 A cartoon in the <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> Star captured the scene: with dynamite bulging out of her purse, a smiling <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> marches away from the Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> as an explosion blows the top off the building. Such was the impact of the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> prime minister's characteristically forthright expression of conservative views last week in a speech to a joint session of Parliament Not since French President <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaulle </PERSON> intervened in the <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> separatist debate in 1967 by declaring `` Vive le Quebec Libre!'' -LRB- Long live a free <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> -RRB- has a foreign leader stirred so much controversy. Fresh from the <ORGANIZATION> Toronto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Summit </ORGANIZATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> for talks with Conservative Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> and to accept an invitation to address Parliament. A standing ovation greeted her, but Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> quickly angered opposition parties by endorsing <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s Free Trade Agreement with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and his decision to buy a $ 6.6 billion fleet of nuclear-powered submarines. Both the main opposition <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the socialist <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> were outraged, and a furious exchange erupted two hours later during Commons question period. `` What right does she have to come here and meddle in <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> affairs?'' <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Broadbent </PERSON> shouted. Liberal leader <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> asked if <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> had vetted <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s remarks, they were so partisan. `` We are no longer a colony of <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and we do not want to become a colony of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said. Both opposition parties say they will tear up the trade deal and cancel the submarine program if they win the next election, which <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> may call as early as this fall. The New Democrats also want to take <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> out of the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> paid special tribute to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s contribution to the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, including its decision to permit tests of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cruise missiles and bolster its navy with nuclear-powered subs. She also took a broad swipe at the `` the debilitating concept of the all-powerful state'' before embracing the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement, which would dismantle trade barriers over a 10-year period. The Liberals and New Democrats say the deal sacrifices independence and threatens to make <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> the 51st state of the union. `` On the basis of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s experience of joining the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, you need have no fear that <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s national personality will be in any way diminished,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said. `` Fifteen years of <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> membership have left our people no less British and no less proud of their history and independence. Moreover, protectionism is not a life belt which keeps an economy afloat; it is a millstone that drags you down and penalizes consumers and work force alike.'' Liberal <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Axworthy </PERSON> likened Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s intervention to a <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> prime minister telling the British what to do about <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. In defense of Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, Deputy Prime Minister <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazankowski </PERSON> called the opposition `` whiners and complainers.'' Ironically, there were no protests a week earlier when West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> addressed the same chamber and, in a more general way, endorsed both the Free Trade Agreement and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s contribution to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. Sensitivities were much greater toward Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, since it was only in 1981 that <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> repatriated its Constitution from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and since Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> remains <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s head of state. The opposition suggested that Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> may have been trying to butter up <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> in hopes he will opt for the British Trafalgar-class submarine over its French rival, the Rubis-Amethyst. By week's end, furor over the speech had turned to humor. <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> columnist <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautens </PERSON> offered Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> some advice on a few problems of her own. He suggested a two-year sabbatical for composer <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Webber </PERSON>, of `` Phantom of the Opera'' and `` Cats'' fame, `` so somebody else can have a chance to write a musical.'' <PERSON> Lautens </PERSON> also asked Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> to ban the use of incomprehensible British expressions such as `` lift'' -LRB- elevator -RRB-, `` tube'' -LRB- subway train -RRB- and `` bonnet'' -LRB- car hood -RRB-. `` While I'm at it,'' <PERSON> Lautens </PERSON> added, `` send some Brits to this country immediately so we can teach them how to make a good hamburg, not one of those Wimpy things.''

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> took steps today to avoid a contentious debate over <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> rules, as party officials met to draft a platform that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will stand on in the fall. The two Democratic presidential rivals reached an agreement to eliminate beginning in 1992 provisions that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said prevented him from getting as many delegates as he deserved, according to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spokesman, <PERSON> Tad </PERSON> <PERSON> Devine </PERSON>. The new rules, being worked on by party officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, are now virtually assured of ratification by the party's national convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> next month. They would cut the number of super delegates by nearly half, and require that all other delegates in all other states be awarded in proportion to votes they receive. Meanwhile, in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, the party's platform panel is taking up a preliminary draft document pledging that <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> would `` restore competence, caring and incorruptibility to the federal executive branch and get it working again fairly for all Americans.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was vacationing today in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. On Friday, he said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> appears uninterested in being the one to run for the No. 2 spot on the ticket. And he was attacked by Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who said, `` we do n't need more taxes, we need a president who can hold the line against congressional overspending.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who was in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> today, has complained that his delegate total this year does not reflect his strength at the polls. <PERSON> Devine </PERSON> said that the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor would have won the nomination even if those proposed rules were in place this year. `` The reason that <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is the nominee of the party is he was the overwhelming choice of the voters,'' said <PERSON> Devine </PERSON>, who is in charge of delegate selection for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' presidential campaign. Senate GOP leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> broadcaster <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, whipped by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the battle for the delegates who will pick the Republican presidential nominee in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> in mid-August, praised the vice president at a party unity rally Friday in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is united and we are not about to see the country go for a mediocre liberal like <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. `` I'd accept the nomination but it's already gone,'' quipped <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. Former Secretary of <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said today that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` is the candidate of safe change.'' `` God help us if <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> wins. He is the candiate of radical and dangerous change,'' <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said Thursday he supports $ 115 million in new taxes to `` make sure the state's fiscal base is solid and strong,'' announcing he would sign a $ 40 million cigarette levy and favored raising another $ 75 million by bringing the state's tax code into line with federal tax law changes. In <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> on Friday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> attacked <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on the tax issue, saying: `` I will not raise your taxes, period. He just has, in his home state.'' At a news conference, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` refuses to rule out a tax hike for the nation. We know what that means.'' Asked if he would rule out all forms of tax increases, even excise taxes, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would, but would not extend that pledge to `` user fees'' such as those charged for entering national parks. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he had a `` plain as day'' difference with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, `` tax cuts vs. tax hikes,'' and added he is not concerned his stand would lock him in if he is elected. `` I think it's reassuring to the working men and women in this country,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. At the unity rally, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` I promise you I'll not raise taxes as a first, second or last resort. ... We do n't need more taxes, we need a president who can hold the line against congressional overspending.'' Back in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> opened a four-day vacation on <LOCATION> Nantucket </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and said Friday that it appears <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, a senator from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, is n't interested in joining the Democratic ticket as the vice presidential candidate. `` We have n't talked personally about it,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` He's somebody I have a lot of respect for. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> apparently told <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON>, a senior adviser leading <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' search for a vice presidential candidate, that he was n't interested in the vice presidential slot `` I respect that,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` In any event, we're going to keep in touch,'' he added. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also said that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, reported by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> to have said privately he would turn down the vice presidential nomination, had not sent any such word to the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign and `` I do n't know anything about'' that published report. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> denied on Friday he had told aides he would reject the vice presidential spot on the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ticket. Asked about the report quoting unidentified aides as saying he would turn it down, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> responded: `` No, absolutely not. Therefore, whoever was talking was not authorized, but also was not dealing in the truth.'' Said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>: `` The matter of the vice presidency is a serious matter. The destiny of our nation, perhaps the rest of the world, rests on the campaign in July and in November. To that extent, there will be no intrigue about that decision.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also said Friday that he has picked up eight of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>'s 57 delegates to the Democratic convention, and his campaign said he wants at least 17. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had won a March 20 `` beauty contest'' primary in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> but the entire delegation had voiced support for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for the presidential nomination. In <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, a 16-member drafting panel unanimously approved a preliminary version of the proposed Democratic platform Friday, in advance of today's meeting of the 186-member Platform Committee. Some differences still divided the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> camps but campaign staffs said they were continuing their negotiations. The preliminary document avoids discussion of higher taxes, a freeze on <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending or a Palestinian homeland. It urges `` more stable defense budgets,'' calls for appointing a drug czar, and says <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is a terrorist state. Without mentioning abortion, it endorses `` freedom of reproductive choice.''

<HEAD>Key Defense Lawmakers Get Millions from Contractors</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The defense contractors under investigation in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> procurement case have poured millions of dollars into the pockets and campaign treasuries of members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, legally doing on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> what would be crimes elsewhere in official <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The principal beneficiaries are the lawmakers who make crucial decisions about <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending and procurement priorities through their memberships on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> armed services committees and defense appropriations subcommittees. Last year, 37 of the 101 members who serve on the four military committees reported receiving about $ 137,100 in speaking fees from defense contractors publicly linked to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> probe. All but $ 10,000 went to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> side of the Capitol, with 33 members _ <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republicans </ORGANIZATION> alike _ averaging $ 3,852 each in so-called honoraria. The Associated Press surveyed the 1987 financial disclosure statements of committee members and campaign contribution reports filed with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> for the 1988, 1986 and 1984 elections. The reports were filed by political action committees maintained by six of the defense contractors who have been searched under warrant issued in the massive probe of alleged <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> procurement fraud and bribery. They are <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's No. 1 defense contractor; <ORGANIZATION> Litton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies-Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Whitney </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cubic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hazeltine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The survey hit only the tip of the iceberg. The companies tied so far to the probe are part of a huge defense industry, with dozens of other firms routinely making campaign contributions and paying honoraria to members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> leaders said last week that they had been told by the chief prosecutor, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, that no lawmakers were targets of the 2-year-old investigation or had had their records seized by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. Speaking fees are legal on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, but they are forbidden by law among executive branch officials. Senators can pocket up to $ 35,800 a year in such outside income, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members up to $ 26,850. The destination of the speaking fees _ often accompanied by free trips for lawmakers and their spouses to defense plants and resorts _ tells a lot about where the real power of the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> purse lies on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. Twenty-two of the 52 members of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> reported getting speaking fees from the surveyed defense contractors. This panel sets broad policy and authorizes items like weapons systems. But a new tank is worthless unless there is money to build it, and that money on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> side of the Capitol comes from the smallest military panel in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the 11-member <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> defense appropriations subcommittee headed by Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>. Last year, <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON> and eight colleagues on the subcommittee reported getting $ 46,250 _ an average of $ 5,138 apiece _ from contractors tied to the investigation <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON> may head the committee, but he was n't the favorite speaker among the contractors with subpoenaed records. That was Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Murtha </PERSON>, D-Pa., who said he collected $ 8,000 for four appearances <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON> reported $ 4,000. Others on the subcommittee getting money from the surveyed contractors included Reps. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, $ 7,000; <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> AuCoin </PERSON>, D-Ore., $ 6,250; <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-La </LOCATION>., $ 6,000; and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Fla </LOCATION>., Young's disclosure statement illustrated a practice among defense contractors, who may fight each other for Pentagon jobs but can cooperate when it comes to taking a lawmaker on a grand tour. Between Jan. 12 and Jan. 16, 1987, nine ontractors _ seven of them not named in the probe _ shared the costs of flying, housing and feeding <PERSON> Young </PERSON> for a trip that included visits to facilities in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. For nine speeches in the five-day stretch, Young picked up $ 13,000 in honoraria, according to his disclosure statement. Speaking fees are small change for defense contractors compared to what they pour into campaign treasuries. In the last three election cycles, nearly $ 3 million was spent on all candidates by political action committees representing six of the companies linked to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> investigation, according to <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> reports. Nearly half of this money _ 47 percent _ was channeled to members of the four military committees. Members of these panels received average contributions of $ 1,293, compared to an average of $ 961 for lawmakers not on the military committees. The biggest spread was in 1983-4 by <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION>'s PAC: an average of $ 2,014 for members of military committees, $ 876 for non-members. Again, the defense appropriations subcommittees were favored PAC targets. The average contribution to a lawmaker on these panels was $ 1,866. House defense appropriations was all-but blanketed with PAC money, with funds usually going to eight or more of the 11 members. For the 18-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> counterpart, no PAC gave to more than eight members in the same election cycle. A PAC can give a candidate up to $ 10,000 in each two-year election cycle. The survey found three instances: <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION>'s PAC to Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., in 1984 and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies-Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> PAC </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> and Sen. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, the same year Military committee members consistently getting higher-than-average PAC contributions included Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif.; Sen. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Murtha </PERSON>; <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON>; Rep. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>, D-Md; and Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ala </LOCATION>. Two lawmakers on Armed Services committees _ Sen. <PERSON> Lawton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., and Rep. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Boxer </PERSON>, D-Calif. _ took neither honoraria nor PAC money from the defense contractors identified with the investigation, the

 When <PERSON> Ziad </PERSON> <PERSON> Abed </PERSON> got engaged, he was looking forward to the music and dancing of a lavish Palestinian wedding. But the Arab uprising changed that, and he married in a simple ceremony last month. `` I did n't think it was the right time for dancing and music when Palestinians are being killed and wounded,'' said <PERSON> Abed </PERSON>, a 26-year-old school bus driver from <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>. The 6 -LCB- - month-old uprising has radically changed the lives of all Palestinians in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, not just those directly involved in confrontations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> `` The uprising has had a great impact on our social and economic structures,'' said <PERSON> Saib </PERSON> <PERSON> Erakat </PERSON>, a political science professor at the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> An-Najah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` The old traditions are fading away.'' Palestinians say their communities, once dominated by religious leaders and wealthy merchants, are now run by young activists, many from poor backgrounds. `` Today you are not judged by how rich or famous you are, you are judged by how active you are in the uprising,'' said <PERSON> Amjad </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarawi </PERSON>, 26, an activist and unemployed laborer from the Dheishe refugee camp near <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>. The uprising also has affected daily routines. <PERSON> Fatima </PERSON> <PERSON> Musa </PERSON>, 47, of Dheishe, said she used to go shopping every Saturday, but now she has to wait for <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leaflets announcing commercial strikes before she can make out her shopping list. `` The uprising created a new daily life,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Musa </PERSON>, a mother of seven, said while peeling potatoes in her sparsely furnished living room. `` We have a different strike day every week, and that means I ca n't have a steady schedule.'' Because of widespread strikes and curfews, many families have organized car pools with their neighbors to do the shopping. Others are stocking up on basic food items. <PERSON> Ata </PERSON> <PERSON> Moghrabi </PERSON>, 62, a retired laborer, keeps two bags each of sugar, rice and flour in his garage. `` We do n't know what is awaiting us tomorrow,'' <PERSON> Moghrabi </PERSON> said. Since the start of the uprising, money has become tight and Palestinians only buy essentials. Many young women no longer wear makeup, some as an expression of mourning for the more than 200 Palestinians killed in the uprising. Others put away their lipstick after being threatened by young militants. In <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> last month, two masked youths approached two teen-age girls in the city's central market and ordered them to wipe off their makeup as a sign of respect for the uprising. The terrified girls complied. The uprising has also put an end to most entertainment. Many movie theaters and restaurants are closed, and the traditional Saturday night parties have been canceled. <PERSON> Abed </PERSON>'s wedding last month was a subdued affair in which the newlyweds' closest relatives briefly stopped by for soft drinks and cake after the ceremony. It was a far cry from traditional weddings, a cornerstone of Palestinian social life, in which hundreds of relatives and friends are served elaborate meals and are entertained by bands. <PERSON> Abed </PERSON> said a man identifying himself only as a Palestinian nationalist called a few days before the ceremony and demanded that it be kept simple, without music or dancing. `` I warn you, and if you do n't follow these instructions, you'll regret it,'' <PERSON> Abed </PERSON> quoted the caller as saying <PERSON> Abed </PERSON> said he was not angered by the threat and that he had already decided on a simple ceremony as a sign of respect for those mourning relatives killed in the uprising. Another newlywed, <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Akar </PERSON>, 27, welcomed the changes, saying they had saved him a lot of money. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Akar </PERSON> said he spent $ 3,500 on his May wedding and his wife's dowry, compared with the $ 15,000 his brother <PERSON> Muayed </PERSON>, a 25-year-old mechanic, paid when he got married a year ago `` Thanks to the glorious uprising, today you can get married without having to buy your bride,'' said <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Akar </PERSON>, a junior high school teacher in Dheishe. The uprising has not only affected private lives but also has overhauled the structure of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> society, said <PERSON> Erakat </PERSON>. So-called popular committees run by young Palestinians have replaced traditional community leaders, such as village elders, Moslem preachers and wealthy businessmen. The committees have organized food distribution to the needy, first aid to those hurt in clashes with soldiers and night patrols alerting residents to possible army raids. Young organizers also enforce commercial strikes and summon residents to participate in marches and demonstrations. `` The committees are replacing the old authority,'' said <PERSON> Sarawi </PERSON>, who heads a committee organizing aid to families whose members have been killed, wounded or imprisoned. <PERSON> Yusef </PERSON> <PERSON> Salah </PERSON>, 22, a popular committee member in the village of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Khader </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, said the changes were not temporary. `` We are a born-again people,'' he said. `` We think differently and we behave differently.''

<HEAD>Dukakis Looks Good Now, But Support Is Soft</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN PUTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, enjoying an early lead over <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in their presidential duel, owes much of his success among mainstream voters to the liberal challenge posed during the Democratic primaries by <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, according to an analysis of primary-season polls. ABC News pollsters who have been tracking the 1988 race say it would be a mistake for the Democrats to pop their champagne corks since voters know little about the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor and their opinions are still loosely held. In fact, voters say they also know little about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Four in 10 of those surveyed last month could not locate Democrat <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> or Republican <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on the ideological spectrum. `` Everything about this race would suggest a close one despite <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' current lead _ because his support is soft,'' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON>, director of the network's polling unit. He notes the percentage who say they do n't know enough about <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is nearly twice that of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has helped, rather than hurt, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> by `` unwittingly acting as a lightning rod for all of the liberal bogey men the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> customarily uses to scare the electorate about the Democrats,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> beat <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> among all liberal primary voters, but his outspoken brand of liberalism made <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> look all the more moderate. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor won overwhelmingly among moderates and conservatives, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> found. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s poll from May 19-25 gave <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> 53 percent support from registered voters to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 40 percent. The margin of error for the survey's 1,172 registered voters was plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. The Iran-Contra affair continues to dog <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, with a majority of the public still doubting that he is telling the truth in the scandal, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> said. The legal problems of Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and other administration woes are also taking their toll, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> found, and many Americans seem ready for a change. What is most puzzling to the pollsters, however, is the public's negative perception of the economy, which could spell problems for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in November About 42 percent see the economy on a downward trend, even though it has been performing better than anticipated after last fall's stock market collapse. `` There's a direct correlation between who you're going to vote for and your view of the economy,'' says <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON>. `` The administration seems to have done everything it possibly could to goose the economy along ... But we do not have a majority saying the economy is in good shape.'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> says <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won his primary race by taking advantage of a strong organization in the weeks before the multi-state Super Tuesday primaries. Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> matched <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in fame and money, and enjoyed a burst of momentum from his opening-day victory in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. But, says <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> polling analyst <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> benefited from the fact that Republicans still had positive feelings about <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` Huge majorities of voters wanted to stick with the course <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had set, and those people voted for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Hanley </PERSON> said. On the Democratic side, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> outpaced his rivals with a clever strategy of conceding some losses in the South while concentrating on the more cosmopolitan Southern states, including delegrate-rich <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. He steamrolled through his Northeastern home turf, weathered defeats in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and rebounded to clinch the nomination. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> polls showed that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> drew strength from Hispanics, Jews and whites in general. And while opponents criticized his lack of foreign policy experience, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> polls showed that primary voters cared little about the issue. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> now appears to be running strongly among <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s black constituents. While <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> captured 90 percent of the black primary vote, registered blacks chose <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> over <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by 80 percent to 12 percent in <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s May poll. Only 6 percent said they would n't vote if <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> were the nominee. In the May survey, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> outpolled <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on personal qualities like whether he `` cares about people,'' is honest, gets things done, has a vision for the future, can be trusted in a crisis and is an able leader. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was perceived as more experienced. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor was seen as more able to help the disenfranchised, keep the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> out of a war and reduce the deficit. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was perceived as better at keeping a strong national defense. Sixty-four percent of Americans had a favorable impression of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, compared with 50 percent for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Only 11 percent had an unfavorable impression of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, compared with 35 percent for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> may be getting his biggest boost from disaffection wih the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration in general and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in specific,'' said <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is having trouble assembling the same coalition of conservatives and disaffected Democrats who twice gave <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> big victories, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> found. He is holding on to his core Republican supporters, but they make up only a quarter of the likely electorate. He is losing the independent vote and is weak among the Democrats who defected to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1984. Surprisingly, a third of those identifying themselves as conservatives said they support <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, as do 43 percent of white born-again Christians. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> gets two-thirds of the registered women voters, a fact that alone explains his lead in the horserace. All this does not necessarily pre-ordain a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> victory, says <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON>, who believes that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' high May favorable rating is a peak. `` Until the final couple of weeks, the public does n't focus on the race that intensely,'' he says. `` So there's plenty of room for change.''

 Rescue workers aided by search dogs fanned out over this rain-soaked village today, trying to unearth about 100 people buried by a landslide. Officials said there was little chance of finding survivors. `` I am nearly sure that no one will come out alive,'' said <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Krctschemer </PERSON>, head of a 32-member West German volunteer team from the <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dog </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` There's very little space for air pockets here, between the soft earth and the rocks, where someone trapped could breathe. But we have to go on looking,'' added <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolter </PERSON>, another member of the German team. Rescue efforts resumed at sunrise today. The search had been called off during the night after geologists and engineers spotted cracks in the mountain that could trigger another devastating slide. <PERSON> Krctschemer </PERSON> said the rescue workers had located the spot where the landslide had buried a coffeehouse crowded with breakfast-time customers on Thursday. He said they were trying to reach the coffeehouse by digging holes from two sides. He said rescuers should be able to unearth some bodies from the site later in the day. Villagers said about 30 travelers were in the restaurant at the time of the disaster and dozens more were at the roadside waiting for bulldozers to clear the highway after an earlier rockfall. Three West German tourists and 41 Turks were listed as missing. There were also unconfirmed reports by witnesses that two British tourists had been in the coffeehouse, but it could not be determined whether they had been buried in the landslide or had left before the disaster. <LOCATION> Trabzon </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Enver </PERSON> <PERSON> Hizlan </PERSON> said there probably would be delay in listing other names because the people involved were in transit. Rescue efforts were hindered by new slides that swept clouds of dust into the air and sent giant boulders hurtling down the wooded mountainside. A Turkish truck driver and a villager were injured in separate rockfalls on Friday. Another landslide hit an area about three miles away from <LOCATION> Catak </LOCATION> today, closing the main highway. No injuries were reported. Grieving relatives watched the rescue works, occasionally kneeling over a hole and looking down with empty eyes. `` Do you think anyone can come out alive from there?'' asked <PERSON> Necati </PERSON> <PERSON> Himtas </PERSON>, whose 20-year-old son was missing. A woman wailing and weeping was taken to the mobile hospital when she fainted. Catak, home to 1,000 people, is situated 19 miles from the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Trabzon </LOCATION> on a main highway leading to eastern Anatolia and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The two-lane highway was widened three years ago to handle increasing truck and tourist traffic, but vilagers said it was not buttressed properly. `` The retaining walls were n't big enough and we started having landslides, not big ones but enough to block the road,'' said <PERSON> Riza </PERSON> <PERSON> Yavuz </PERSON>, the village headman. <PERSON> Yavuz </PERSON> said the coffeehouse owner had told public works officials earlier this month that the hillside needed more support or it would collapse. <PERSON> Erkan </PERSON> <PERSON> Omarbeyoglou </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s director of highways, warned that new cracks had appeared on the same stretch of mountainside, suggesting another section could be dislodged. `` There's a risk that an entire hilltop could come crashing down in the same area,'' <PERSON> Omarbeyoglou </PERSON> said. He said rescue workers would have enough warning to evacuate the area. The landslide Thursday also destroyed a restaurant, 20 homes and a high school closed for summer vacation. A stream burst its banks and flooded another part of the village, including several houses. `` I saw a telegraph pole slowly bending over,'' said <PERSON> Gaby </PERSON> <PERSON> Engler </PERSON>, a 28-year-old West German nurse, who witnessed the slide. `` I heard a noise like an explosion and the whole hillside came away in front of me.''

 A waitress at a beachfront restaurant today spotted a bomb and led scores of patrons to safety moments before the device exploded, police said. The explosion occurred shortly after midnight at the <LOCATION> Papagallo </LOCATION> restaurant on <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s seaside esplanade. The bomb, a Soviet-made limpet mine, was discovered by a waitress who alerted the manager, police said. Police arrived, evacuated about 90 diners and were in the process of evacuating people from neighboring hotels when the bomb exploded, less than 20 minutes after it had been seen. `` It was a close shave,'' said Maj. <PERSON> Trevor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, a police spokesman. The interior of the restaurant was extensively damaged. No injuries or arrests were reported. There have been more than 20 bombings in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> this year, and police have blamed the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement. The group has neither claimed nor denied responsibility for specific recent bombings but has said it seeks to intensify its attacks. The guerrillas are fighting the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> government and its system of apartheid, which does not permit the 26 million black majority to vote and racially segregates schools, districts and health services.

 Leaders at the <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> summit congratulated themselves on forging an economy able to withstand last year's stock market crash, but economists agree they did little that could prevent future instability `` I think they announced in advance that they were n't going to accomplish anything, and therefore they fulfilled all expectations,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleimann </PERSON>, an expert on economic summits with the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>. `` It was a summit of little consequence in terms of the overall debt and budget problems that we face,'' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergner </PERSON>, a fellow with the <ORGANIZATION> Hudson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a moderate-to-conservative think tank based in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and other leaders at the seven-nation summit painted a somewhat rosier picture. `` I know many people question the summit process,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told the Business Table of Chief Executive Officers Wednesday night after his return from his 14th and last economic summit meeting. `` What do the summits do? Are they just so much sound and fury?'' `` Well, not on your life,'' he answered himself. `` Today, all year round, the summit countries are working more closely together than ever before and the summits are a key reason why. One payoff is that last October, when the world markets began to shake, the international economy stayed steady. Working together, we guided the world ship through the storm.'' In their final communique, the leaders of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> said that since last year's meeting in <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> `` our economies have kept up the momentum of growth'' and were still expanding. British Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said that `` the very clear message that goes out from <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> is one of confidence coupled with a commitment to build on and reinforce our success.'' Even the chairman of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s own <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisers </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON>, however, gave only a modest assessment of the summit gains in a post-summit interview. Asked if the summiteers had made any concrete progress toward their objectives, <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON> said, `` If this were the only summit that were ever held, or ever had been held, I'd say, ` Yes, a lot.' But it builds incrementally on prior summits.'' `` We are not at the end of the process,'' <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON> added. `` There is a lot more to be done.'' For instance, he said, marginal tax rate cuts being proposed by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> `` seemed very small to me.'' As for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, he said, `` We are happy that the budget deficit seems to be on a downward trend and the trade deficit is coming down. But you do n't want to look only at trends; you need to check levels, and they are still unsatisfactorily high.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Z. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, senior fellow in economic studies with the liberal <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` No attention has really been focused on the financial markets and little on the potential sources of underlying instability, which basically are related to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> budget deficit. And since they kind of all took it as given that the president was n't going to do anything on that one, they really could n't get an American commitment on that one, it was n't worth talking about.'' `` It does n't mean to say they wo n't be back about that question,'' he said, when they meet again in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> with a new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president in office in 1989.

<HEAD>Judge May Reconsider Refusal To Halt USAir Overtime Boycott</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge who refused to order <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> flight attendants to halt an apparent overtime boycott says he may change his mind should the boycott continue. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Standish </PERSON> on Friday said he found no clear proof that the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attendants </ORGANIZATION> encouraged the boycott, which stranded 11,000 passengers during the Memorial Day weekend. He denied the airline's request for a preliminary injunction, for lack of firm evidence against the union. Still, <PERSON> Standish </PERSON> said, he has a `` strong suspicion'' of union involvement. If the job action continues, he said, he would grant a request for an immediate hearing to reconsider his decision. The airline said it lost an estimated $ 1.1 million as a result of having to cancel 179 flights because of inadequate staffing during the three-day holiday. `` We are pleased that the court put the Association of Flight Attendants on notice,'' said airline spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Shipley </PERSON>. `` As a result, we expect no future scheduled disruptions.'' Under their union contract, flight attendants can be ordered to fly only 85 hours per month. Attendants can turn down assignments after they have reached 85 hours in a month. <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> relies on attendants to volunteer for overtime to keep planes in the air on the waning days of each month. <PERSON> Dee </PERSON> <PERSON> Maki </PERSON>, chief union representative for the Pittsburgh-based flight attendants group, said she has `` no idea'' if the protest will end. But she said only some of the attendants who refused to work during the Memorial Day holiday were protesting stalled labor negotiations. Many simply wanted the holiday off, she said. Ms. <PERSON> Maki </PERSON> said flight attendants were elated at the judge's decision `` They ca n't believe <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> filed the lawsuit,'' she said. She noted that the Independence Day holiday weekend occurs at the beginning of the month so flight attendants will not be working on overtime and therefore can not turn down assignments. <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> brought the suit last week amid stalled contract negotiations with the 1,000 flight attendants of <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, which merged with <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> in April. Federal law forbids airline workers to launch job actions or strikes before mediation and arbitration procedures are exhausted.

 Protesters hurled stones at <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> police early today during a clash over a disputed piece of land near the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall, authorities said. Police used tear gas and water canons to break up the demonstration. Police said one officer was injured when he was struck in the head by a rock. The so-called `` Lenne Triangle'' _ about 10 acres of land adjacent to the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall _ has been the scene of frequent skirmishes between police and environmental activists, who occupied the area on May 26 to protest plans for construction of a road through the area. The activists are against the road project because it would go through a wooded area. The property, which 150 protesters continue to occupy, currently belongs to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, but will be turned over to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> in July. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> police, who can not legally enter the property, have fenced it in to keep more protesters from entering. The activists tried to tear down the barrier, but police drove them back. Police said todays clash began after protesters attacked officers with stones, bottles, Molotov cocktails and flares. East German border troops observed the incident from nearby guard towers along the heavily-fortified wall that divides the city, which is surrounded by East German territory.

<DATELINE>MUNICH, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police today arrested 14 soccer fans during violent clashes in downtown <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> before the final of the European soccer championships, which will pit The <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> against the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. A <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> police spokesman, who asked not to be identified, said most of the fans arrested were Dutch. He said a Swiss man and several West Germans were also in custody after incidents earlier today. Police said those arrested face charges of assault, theft, resisting arrest and destruction of property. Before the clashes, the fans had been drinking heavily in the city's beer garden district, police said. A capacity crowd of 72,000, including 20,000 Dutch fans, is expected for Saturday's championship game. More than 3,500 police officers are on duty to try to prevent fan violence. A total of more than 800 fans have been arrested as a result of violence that erupted in many West German cities since the championship series began June 10.

<HEAD>Top Pentagon Fraud Prosecutor Made His Name Fighting Pornography</HEAD>

 <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney overseeing the Pentagon fraud probe, made his name fighting pornography, not corruption. He is known as `` an aggressive sort of guy'' who is n't averse to publicity At 41, <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> is looking at perhaps his biggest case, the investigation into allegations that defense contractors and consultants bribed <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials for information to help win billions of dollars in contracts. He prides himself on `` quality prosecutions, and being firm and fair.'' Others say he is a dogged prosecutor, almost moralistic in his zeal. <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> is the top federal attorney in northern <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, where the Pentagon is located and where many of the consultants and contractors being investigated have offices. Although there is a special unit in the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> that tracks down fraud, it appears that the case went to <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> because it was too massive for the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> unit to handle. Also, the unit's offices were located in northern <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, within <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION>'s Just across the <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> from the <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION>, the district traditionally has been a high-profile one for a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney prosecuting federal cases. <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> and his assistant, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Aronica </PERSON>, will argue the cases for the government if any charges come to trial. `` There's a certain amount of prestige that comes with the turf. But <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> is an aggressive sort of guy,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Horan </PERSON>, the state attorney for <LOCATION> Fairfax </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, in an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> Fairfax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> took over the federal prosecutor's job in 1986 and pledged to improve the office's reputed organization problems and to put a greater emphasis on cases of national significance. As a <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> state prosecutor, he'd earned the reputation of a `` policeman's prosecutor'' with his crackdowns on massage parlors and adult bookstores, and his efforts to reduce plea bargains and increase jail sentences. <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> entered the national spotlight two years ago when Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> made him chairman of his pornography commission. The panel drew derision from civil liberties groups, as well as rave reviews from anti-pornography crusaders, with its 1986 report that asserted that sex crimes can be linked to hard-core pornography. The panel's stance represented an about-face from the conclusion of another government commission in 1970 that there was no evidence of harm from pornography. Among other things, <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>'s panel recommended that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> force pornography traffickers to forfeit their profits, and that video pornography producers be prosecuted for prostitution. A second conviction under obscenity laws would become a felony guaranteeing at least a year behind bars. <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> argued at the time that the panel should have taken even more drastic steps. `` I would have preferred that our condemnation of materials directly affecting behavior be couched in more forceful language, and that our recommendations for enhanced law enforcement, particularly with respect to violent and degrading materials, be likewise more pronounced,'' <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> wrote. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> lambasted the panel as biased, unfair and its arguments `` intellectually indefensible.'' It accused <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> of advocating `` extreme measures'' while paying little attention to privacy and First Amendment rights. One member of the panel, <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, said in an interview this past week that even though she strongly disagreed with some of <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>'s opinions, she thinks he'll `` do as as good a job as he can possibly do'' with the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> probe. `` He has a very dogged personality and a very strong sense of right and wrong,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, editor in chief of Woman's Day magazine. She said that she did not put much stock in reports that the attorney was a man who loved being in the headlines. `` He was a very moral man, if not moralistic, and he'll do his duty,'' Ms. <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> said.

<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Iraqi army said today it recaptured the Majnoon islands in another offensive against Iranian positions inside <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> reported heavy fighting in the area. A war communique read over <ORGANIZATION> Baghdad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said the series of islands located in the Hawayza marshes near the Iranian border was completely liberated at noon -LRB- 4 a.m. EDT -RRB-. The report said the elite Presidential Guards took the islands while troops from the 3rd army corps `` pushed forward to crush the enemy and its defenses and guns on lands opposite the islands.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has occupied the area, located northeast of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> and about 270 miles southeast of the capital of <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, since 1984. The area lies near the border with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, and it was unclear whether <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> forces had pushed into Iranian territory. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, in seeking a cease-fire in the war, has said its troops would not enter <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. `` Our forces started their advance at 3:45 a.m. toward <LOCATION> Majnoon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and its surroundings,'' the official Iraqi news agency said earlier, quoting a communique from the general command of the Iraqi armed forces. `` The resistance of the enemy deteriorated and collapsed due to the Iraqi heavy fire,'' added the Iraqi report. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> news agency accused <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> of using chemical weapons in the attack and said heavy fighting was going on in the swampland. The <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> report, also monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said `` substantial losses and damage have been inflicted on the Iraqi forces and a number of them have been captured. Heavy fighting reportedlly continues in the region.'' The <ORGANIZATION> INA </ORGANIZATION> dispatch called the operation, codenamed `` Trust in God,'' the second phase of the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> push to liberate areas occupied by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> along the southern border east of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>. The dispatch compared the battle to the April 16 assault on the <LOCATION> Faw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION>, which ended two years of Iranian occupation in that area. The nearly 8-year-old war had reached a stalemate before the Iraqis seized the initiative with their lightening assault on Faw. The Iraqi's sudden switch from years of static warfare from behind their formidable defense lines to aggressive attacking techniques caught the Iranians off guard. In May, the Iraqis struck again, driving the Iranians out of the bridgehead around <LOCATION> Salamchah </LOCATION>, also east of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>, in a 10-hour battle. The latest battle was an assault on Mehran last week by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION>, a group of Iranian rebels backed by the government of <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claimed the capture of the border city was the work of regular Iraqi troops, but both <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and the Iranian insurgents denied the claim. The rebel army, following its usual pattern of inflicting as much damage on the forces of the <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> and then withdrawing, said its forces pulled back across the Iraqi border on Wednesday. The attack on Mehran, 90 miles east of <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, might have been a diversion to draw Iranian forces away from the southern front around <LOCATION> Majnoon </LOCATION> island in preparation for the new <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> assault, according to a <LOCATION> Perisan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity.

<HEAD>Ferreting Out The Truth A Capital Dilemma</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's capital had plenty of attention-grabbers last week _ a juicy <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> scandal, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s last summit, a new $ 16 million House of Representatives phone system that went deaf _ but here's what <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was really talking about: A fugitive ferret named <PERSON> Fuji </PERSON>, its combative owner, and a 5-year-old boy. Not even <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>'s uninvited, underwear swimmer _ the 18-year-old suburban lad shot after taking an unauthorized dip in the columnist's pool _ could match the continuing drama. The ferret's owner, 19-year-old <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Au </PERSON>, was on a weekend furlough from jail where she spent the week charged with contempt of court for not telling where <PERSON> Fuji </PERSON> is. The boy, <PERSON> Auston </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, was nearing the end of a painful series of six rabies shots. The story began June 3 when <PERSON> Auston </PERSON>'s grandmother took him to the Docktor Pet Center in <LOCATION> Manassas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> suburb. He stopped by a cage containing <PERSON> Fuji </PERSON> and two other ferrets. One bit him. Authorities then sought to kill each of the ferrets and test their innards for rabies. Two of the ferrets were sacrificed _ their heads cut off and their brains examined by health officials, who found the animals to have been healthy. But <PERSON> Fuji </PERSON> was spirited away by Miss Au, who worked in the pet shop. In court, charged with concealing the animal, she said she left the ferret at an abandoned house after making a deal over the telephone with someone she did n't know to have it picked up. The anonymous phone contact apparently was made after the biting incident became known to a group of ferret lovers. Miss Au told Circuit Judge <PERSON> Percy </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> that said she saw the boy being bitten and that <PERSON> Fuji </PERSON> did n't do it. Moreover, she said, the ferret had been isolated in a cage for more than a month, and its continued good health proved it did n't have rabies. She said she had tried to comply with the judge's order to produce the animal by contacting ferret groups, but the judge was unsympathetic. `` You're putting this child at risk,'' <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> said and found her in contempt. When she shouted at him, the judge ordered her jailed for three hours. `` I think your priorities are mixed up,'' said <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON>. A weekend went by and the ferret still had not been produced. <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> ordered Miss Au to jail. `` If it were in this court's power,'' said the judge, `` I would put you through the same thing this child is going through. On Thursday, with the ferret still missing, Miss Au appeared before the judge for a bond hearing and was turned down. On Friday, <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> issued the weekend leave and ordered the young woman back behind bars on Monday. Meanwhile, a second person _ a 24-year-old man who was not publicly identified _ was scheduled to begin the rabies shots after he said he was bitten by a ferret in the same store. The ferret battle was fought not only in court, but in the pages of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Post. An editorial sided with the judge and his hard line. `` It is truly contemptible that this woman and her confederates have chosen to put a child through this torture rather than obey a court order and the dictates of common decency,'' said the Post. But in the same issue, writer <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> allied himself with the ferret. `` There has to be some reasonable basis for thinking this particular ferret, despite testimony to the contrary, bit the boy, and from everything you could read of the case there was no reason to doubt the woman when she swore it was not her ferret,'' he wrote. The ferret story was not the clear winner in the talk-of-the-town competition. The Rowan-intruder story resurfaced when authorities decided to charge the uninvited swimmer and the young woman arrested with him in <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>'s back yard, but not to charge the columnist for shooting the young man. The on-again, off-again phone system in the House was a one-day sensation, causing impassioned denunciations from congressmen who found their link to constituents interrupted. And the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> procurement scandal continued to bubble. The week's most telling quote came from Miss Au, when she was jailed on Monday: `` This is extremely stupid and ridiculous, needless,'' she said. `` This has gone too far.''

<HEAD>Minority Enrollment In Medical Schools Rose After Bakke, Study

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In the decade since a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision in the <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakke </PERSON> case ended the use of enrollment quotas, the number of minority students admitted to medical school actually increased in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colleges </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Petersdorf </PERSON>, president of the association, said that in 1978 it was feared that the Bakke decision, which forbids the use of special consideration in the admission of minorities, would cause medical schools to enroll even fewer minorities than before. `` The opposite proved to be true,'' <PERSON> Petersdorf </PERSON> said. In the first enrollment period after the Bakke decision, 40.9 percent of the minority students who applied to medical schools were admitted, and minority enrollees composed 8.7 percent of first-year medical school classes. Ten years later, <PERSON> Petersdorf </PERSON> said, the medical schools are admitting 51.7 percent of the minority applicants and they now represent 10.2 percent of the entering classes. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision actually encouraged affirmative action goals by allowing the use of race and other determinants in addition to academic achievement as acceptable admissions criteria,'' <PERSON> Petersdorf </PERSON> said. He said that medical schools began affirmative action steps in 1970 and the <PERSON> Bakke </PERSON> decision `` reaffirmed'' them.

 Federal regulators give <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> money centers with troubled overseas loans more leeway than <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> banks hobbled by declines in oil prices and a deflated real estate market, Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said Saturday. `` The result is that domestic borrowers have greater difficulty acquiring credit than borrowers like <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said in a letter urging the chiefs of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, and the comptroller of the currency to review their regulatory practices. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said recent data indicate banks must set aside greater reserves against domestic troubled loans than against troubled loans to Third World and Eastern Bloc nations. `` This favorable treatment by regulators of troubled foreign loans over domestic loans will crimp credit to domestic borrowers,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> wrote <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON>, comptroller of the currency. `` This is particularly important to areas like <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> whose banks hold a disproportionate share of troubled domestic loans,'' wrote <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. As the state attempts to rebuild its economy, it needs a `` robust and healthy banking system able to provide needed credit to worthy borrowers ranking from small businesses to ranchers and farmers.'' <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> had not seen the letter and could not comment on it. But he said regulators were not being any more stringent on <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> banks than those elsewhere in the country. Rates for reserves set aside for foreign loans depend on a variety of factors, including the country, the loan and the bank, <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Cross </PERSON>, an aide to <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON>, said the comptroller shared <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s concerns about the problems in the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> economy and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> banks, but he wanted to see the figures on which the senator's letter was based before commenting further. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> data indicate that an amount comparable to 51 percent of non-performing domestic loans is being held as loan loss reserves. But calculations by the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> suggest that `` considerably smaller reserves _ only 24 percent _ are being set aside against troubled loans by banks to Third World and Eastern Bloc nations,'' he wrote. `` I think this is unfair and unequal treatment,'' said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. `` I would much rather have a loan collateralized by an empty building in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> than to depend on the commitments of a foreign communist country like <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said he was drafting legislation to correct `` that kind of slanted treatment, favoring the big money banks in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> banks.'' `` It really hurts not just the banks in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, but the borrowers too, because we do n't have sufficient capital _ that means for small businesses, medium-sized businesses,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said.

 Investigators in the Pentagon bribery probe videotaped meetings in which <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> personnel allegedly took payoffs from consultants, sources familiar with the two-year investigation said today. The sources said that two key figures in the probe, <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, deputy assistant secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> for tactical systems, and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON>, a deputy assistant secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, appear on some of the videotapes, although they declined to characterize what those tapes showed. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday night that <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> would leave the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> whenever a defense consultant would call, that his meetings with consultants were recorded and videotaped and that money changed hands. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, reported that <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, deputy assistant secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> for tactical systems, is among those cooperating in the investigation. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> <PERSON> Glanzer </PERSON>, declined to comment today about any aspect of the probe when asked about the videotapes of alleged payoffs to his client and whether his client was cooperating with the government. <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON> also was videotaped at meetings with consultants where highly confidential documents relating to <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> contracts allegedly changed hands, said the sources. Sources close to the case said this week that <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON> is cooperating in the investigation, but other sources and The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said today that while <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON> gave a statement to investigators earlier, he is not cooperating with prosecutors at this point. The consultants shown on the videotapes include <PERSON> Melvyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>, a former assistant secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> whose office was searched by federal authorities last week in the investigation. The secret information could have given the recipients an advantage in competing for contracts worth billions of dollars. Between 75 and 100 <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> contracts may have been tainted, according to prosecutor <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON> have been temporarily reassigned to other duties since their offices were searched last week by investigators. <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON>' attorney, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Schatzow </PERSON> said Friday night he had no comment on the videotapes, but added: `` I'll just wait and allow everybody who's been reporting these stories to wait and be embarrassed later.'' <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Barcella </PERSON>, denounced the leaking of information on videotaping. `` This is just a further example of the government trying their case in the press rather than waiting for specific allegations to try in court,'' <PERSON> Barcella </PERSON> said. The information on videotapes surfaced as members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are debating how the government should treat defense contractors under scrutiny in a wide-ranging probe into whether they bought information from consultants who got the information from <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials they bribed. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> considered legislation Friday that would have given the government the power to withhold payments to companies that are under investigation in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> probe. The proposal was withdrawn after a debate in which one side argued that no payments should be made on fraudulently obtained contracts, while the other side insisted that such action would be premature. Meanwhile, a senator said in a television interview that if corruption was detected in a substantial number of contracts, they should be renegotiated. `` And that's a tough, tough problem, because those contracts are producing essential goods to our national defense today,'' Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., said on a syndicated television interview show, `` <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON>'s One on One. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> is a former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> secretary. The amendment considered by the <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> was offered by Sen. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>. He said he was pressing it to head off measures by <PERSON> Sens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, that would have affected specific contractors. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said his amendment would give the government an option, short of permanently terminating a contract, to halt payments temporarily where `` these practices may have caused the government to be not treated fairly.'' But other lawmakers argued that the enactment of such a law would prematurely interfere with the investigation of the scandal and threaten the jobs of workers at defense contracting firms. `` You're going to hurt a lot of innocent people,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON>, <PERSON> R-N.H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> withdrew his proposal, saying he might introduce it on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor later, after the other lawmakers agreed not to pursue their more specific provisions. He had introduced the language as an amendment to the $ 282.6 billion fiscal 1989 <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> appropriations bill, which the committee sent to the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on a voice vote. Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, asked about the probe's status, said he did not know `` whether it will expand at all,'' adding: `` It's at the normal stage of an investigation ... where you're collecting information, you're analyzing information and then you're determining what the next steps might be. Elsewhere, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON>, an attorney for <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said he has asked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> to allow the company to examine a government affidavit supporting a search warrant that the judge had issued. The warrant enabled <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents to go through the downtown <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office of <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Tallia </PERSON>, a vice president for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> operations of the company's <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Whitney </LOCATION> engine manufacturing unit. Company lawyers said they wanted to examine the affidavit to determine whether the search was proper. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> asserted in the search warrant that <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> possessed sensitive documents that rival <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> had submitted to the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in competing for hundreds of millions of dollars in contracts.

<HEAD>Tax Hike, Scandal Makes Tough Week For Usually Lucky Dukakis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who so far has seemed blessed by that greatest of all political commodities, good luck, is enjoying a brief island retreat after a week in which events seemed to be moving against him. In the span of a few days last week, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor faced the unpleasant task of raising state taxes and saw two potential scandals burst into view back at the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Statehouse </LOCATION>. The Democratic presidential nominee-to-be came under fresh attack from his Republican rival. And <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s shifting comments provided a potentially divisive distraction as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> sought to focus on the task of selecting a running mate. `` It's not a worry,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said when asked about the potential danger posed by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to the ticket. `` I enjoy this. It's one of the great jobs of being a chief executive, ... putting a team together.'' As <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> relaxed on this scenic island off <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION>, Republican rival <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> already was seizing on his reluctant endorsement of state tax increases and stepping up his criticism of the governor's program allowing prison inmates out on furlough. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' decision to sign the state legislature's bill imposing a 5 percent increase on the tax on cigarettes, producing $ 40 million in revenues, was one of several moves to shore up a state budget shortfall. `` Taxes are always a last resort,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in his defense. With serious budget problems that already have prompting spending cuts, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also is supporting another $ 75 million in increases by bringing the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> tax code in line with federal tax changes. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the certain <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee who lags behind <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> by double digits in most polls, immediately pointed to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' support for <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> taxes as evidence he harbors a similar inclination as a fix for the large federal deficits. `` I will not raise your taxes, period. He just has, in his home state,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He was voicing a `` tax cuts versus tax hikes'' theme Democrats expect to hear more of as Republicans try to appeal to what they calculate is a national aversion to deal with the deficit by increasing taxes. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has avoided saying he would support any federal tax increase if elected president, but he clearly has left the door open. He proposes increased efforts to enforce tax laws, including the hiring of more federal revenue agents, coupled with spending cuts and steps to increase revenues by spurring the economy. `` If you do all those things and still need additional revenues, then you have to be willing to go to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and ask for it,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. If <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has seemed fortunate as major or potential rivals dropped aside in his quest for the nomination, he might not have felt that way Thursday, as he confronted a state deadline on the tax question, felt <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s barbs, and faced questions about allegations of misdeeds in his administration. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his aides put forward a picture of unconcern over the disclosure that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> was conducting a preliminary investigation into the state's planned purchase of land for a prison in the rural town of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Braintree </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> denied any wrongdoing, and administration officials questioned whether political motivations lay behind disclosure. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, commenting on a report about the preliminary probe in The <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Times, said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was not the subject of their inquiry _ but added that it was not yet at a stage where anyone was a target. Some residents of the town have accused <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of cronyism in his support for purchasing land there for the prison in a deal that would result in a handsome profit for developers who purchased the land. Whether <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was acquainted with the developers was a matter of dispute. One, however, was a contributor to his presidential campaign. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> cited `` executive privilege'' in refusing to release two documents sought by opponents. They are memos between <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his legal counsel just before transactions involving the property. An unrelated embarrassment came when the governor's former education adviser <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Indelicato </PERSON> was accused of larceny and forgery related to his state duties. <PERSON> Indelicato </PERSON> previously pleaded guilty to separate federal charges of fraud and conspiracy. `` The criminal charges against <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Indelicato </PERSON> are very serious, more so because they allege a violation of the public trust,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. Over this series of backyard problems, the specter of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s potentially devisive interest in the vice presidency loomed <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has sent seemingly confusing, conflicting signals over whether he wants the vice presidency, but it seemed certain he'd like to be asked _ even though public polls suggest he would be a drag on the Democratic ticket nationally `` Everybody knows in the last analysis the nominee has to make that decision, and people accept that ...'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` Including <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>, by the way.''

<HEAD>Support Growing For European `Federal Reserve' Bank</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Creation of a West European central bank, an idea that gained little currency in the past, is quietly emerging as a long-range priority of the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>. The prospect of establishing a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Federal Reserve-style central bank for <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is expected to be a major topic of discussion at an <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> summit conference starting June 27 in <LOCATION> Hanover </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. But decisions to take the first concrete steps toward a `` Eurobank'' to manage a common monetary policy are not likely in <LOCATION> Hanover </LOCATION>, analysts say. Many other related questions, such as harmonizing tax policies in the Common Market, probably will have to be settled first. <PERSON> Norbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Walter </PERSON>, senior economist at <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, says establishment of a central bank for <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> probably is still `` a long way off.'' Some <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> members, such as <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, do n't like the idea. They think it would force them to surrender too much national control. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> has not even heeded her <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> partners' urgings to include <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in the European Monetary System, which was created in 1979 to keep European currency values stable. Yet talk of a European currency union is becoming more serious than just a year ago, when the idea _ which has been discussed off and on for more than two decades _ was generally dismissed as a pipe dream. `` It is not just utopia, it is not nirvana. It is something that can be accepted in the <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> of today,'' <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. Many European leaders have come to believe that the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s plan for creating a true common market by 1992 _ one that allows goods, people and money to freely cross national borders _ increases the need for a European central bank to cope with less rigid capital markets. This feeling has been reinforced by a June 13 agreement by European finance ministers to remove national controls on capital movements by July 1990 in the eight most advanced <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> countries. The agreement excludes the four countries that have joined the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> since 1973 _ <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> were given a deadline of 1992; <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> have until 1995. <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON>, the West German finance minister, hailed the accord as `` a milestone of great importance'' on the path to unifying the European market and increasing the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s global competitiveness. At the <LOCATION> Hanover </LOCATION> summit, West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> is expected to propose that a special panel of central bank officials and other experts from <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> countries be set up to study the central bank issue. `` This is a topic that is clearly gaining pace,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, senior <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> economist at the London-based investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Philips </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Drew </PERSON>. The eventual structure of a European central bank is far from clear, but one idea is to model it after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, with regional representatives and independently appointed governors. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> is a strong supporter of establishing a true European monetary union, with a central bank as the linchpin, but the independent <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION>, or German central bank, has been cool to the idea. `` The vision of a <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> union is most certainly closely bound with that of a European currency union,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> told a recent <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> conference. Even though one of the original aims of the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> was to create an economic and monetary union, all the member nations still have their own currencies and set their own policies on interest rates and money supply. An embryonic regional currency, known as the European currency unit, or Ecu, has been in use since 1979, but mainly as an accounting device. The Ecu does not exist as a hard currency in bank notes or coins, except for a special issue of Ecu coins last year by <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the founding of the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>. The Ecu is based on an average of Common Market currencies and currently is worth about $ 1.20. A European central bank would, in the vision held by many supporters of an <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> monetary union, be the manager of the Ecu _ much as the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> manages the dollar _ by influencing interest rate levels and controlling the supply of money in the economy. One of the main questions to be settled is whether a European monetary authority could co-exist with national central banks or whether it would replace them. If this and other complex issues are resolved, European economic integration will have advanced much further than even the most ardent European unionists would have believed possible in the early 1980s.

<TEXT>
 With no end in sight to the 4-month-old writers strike, thousands of workers who depend on movie and TV production for a living face a summer of dwindling savings accounts and mounting bills. From Sunset Strip restaurants to dry cleaners in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> community and the businesses that profit from it are withering on the vine at a time when activity should be at its peak in preparation for the fall harvest of new television shows and Oscar-contending movies. `` I hope this strike ends soon,'' said <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> of the family-owned La Boutique Dry Cleaners in suburban <LOCATION> Sherman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oaks </LOCATION>, home to many film and TV performers and workers. `` They were coming in with their silk shirts and wool gabardine suits. Now they come in with their T-shirts and <PERSON> Levis </PERSON>.'' Members of the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> voted Wednesday to continue their walkout, rejecting by a 3-to-1 margin a `` final offer'' from the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION>. The writers went on strike March 7 over the issues of payments for reruns of one-hour shows and programs broadcast in foreign markets, as well as creative control. Virtually all programming for the fall season has been idled. The exceptions are some independently produced shows that have signed their own guild contracts, including `` The Cosby Show'' and `` The Tonight Show.'' In addition, work on the studios' major theatrical movies for the fall and winter seasons _ traditionally a time when many potential Academy Award nominees are released _ has been curtailed. `` It's devastating,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Slusser </PERSON>, senior vice president and general manager of <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION>. `` We've already made a number of cutbacks in the TV and studio operations group.'' Even the famous Universal commissary is affected. On Friday it was closed and its employees laid off until further notice. `` This city is designed for the entertainment industry, and this is destroying it,'' said <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellis </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Unitel </ORGANIZATION>, a major post-production facility on the lot of <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bellis </PERSON> said his business, which handles editing and sound-dubbing for TV shows such as `` Family Ties,'' has been down 50 percent since the strike. He has not laid off any of his 60 employees `` because I have not had the heart to do it,'' he said. `` But my feeling is that if this goes on, I'm going to have to cut my staff at least 60 percent. But I wo n't as long as I can hold out and my bank will stay with me.'' Many of those affected by the strike are studio workers represented by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theatrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION>, and Local 44 President <PERSON> Mac </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> said his members are looking at dwindling bank accounts. `` I've had several calls looking for help in mortgages and car payments,'' <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> said. `` These people do n't work 52 weeks a year normally. Now they're not working on the weeks they normally have.'' His union local, with 3,750 members, was 60 percent unemployed, compared with 28 percent for the same time last year. The union includes special effects technicians, decorators, prop makers, upholsterers and drapers. At Art's Deli in <LOCATION> Studio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, owner <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON> estimated business was down 10 percent to 15 percent at one of the area's favorite gathering spots for show business dealmaking `` Not only are we missing the writers and producers, but the agents meeting with their clients, the studio drivers and all the people in the industry,'' <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON> said. `` It's a related thing all down the line.'' Recently at the historic <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> haunt <PERSON> Musso </PERSON> and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s, two of the town's most important men sat unrecognized for hours at one of the tables: Producers Alliance President <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Counter </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> chief negotiator <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON>. The informal session failed to settle the dispute, but they were never interrupted as they bargained inside the venerable show business restaurant that their differences had helped to empty.

<TEXT>
 A restaurant owner whose business is off 30 percent quit making doughnuts because nobody buys them. The same news about dried up business is repeated at the liquor store, tire shop, grocery and appliance store. The worst drought in 50 years is a double whammy for <LOCATION> Tunica </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, one of the poorest counties in the nation. Farmers who grow cotton, soybeans and wheat in the upper <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> are afraid their crops will burn up, and a lake that used to lure tourist dollars is so low that few fishermen and boaters bother to go out. `` Boy, it hurts. There's not a business in town that's not affected,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>, sitting behind the counter of the customerless Brown Bag Liquors. `` It's a real bad situation all the way around.'' <LOCATION> Tunica </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> is 64 percent farmland. It ranks 78th among <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>'s 82 counties in per capita income, with a yearly average of $ 6,800, according to the state economist's office. Other than the recreation business from the lake, it has no industry. The population is 9,652, down from 16,826 in 1960. Cotton is still king here, accounting for 40 percent of the crop value. But there also are long, straight rows of soybeans, wheat, rice and other crops in flat fields of sandy loam and buckshot black clay. They're all struggling to grow. There has n't been a decent rain since April. ` It has n't got to the point where we're going to abandon the crop and throw the towel in. But we're hurting,'' said county agriculture agent <PERSON> Dwayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON>. `` The drought affects everybody. When the farmer's not spending money, there's not a whole lot of money being spent,'' <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON> said. `` It's killing my business,'' said <PERSON> Wiley </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, owner of the Blue and White Restaurant, where the glazed cake doughnuts are a thing of the past. `` These farmers wo n't spend any money when it looks bad, and it looks bad.'' <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sturgill </PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> Tire and Alignment, had nary a car or tractor in his garage. `` Look in the shop, there's nothing. We have n't done any business,'' <PERSON> Sturgill </PERSON> said. On a 100-plus degree day, the pavement seems to melt in the distance under a blistering sun, and dogs nap in what shade they can find. Tractors pulling discs kick up clouds of dust that hang in the air and assault the throat. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bibb </PERSON>, 55, has 4,000 acres of land, some of which has n't been planted while he waits for rain On Friday, he laid off 15 farmhands. `` We're scared of what may be facing us,'' <PERSON> Bibb </PERSON> said. `` We're in no position to stand a sorry crop. We ca n't survive a complete bust. All we can do is put our faith in the good Lord. Worrying do n't help.'' If it's too dry to plow, the fish surely are n't biting at the <LOCATION> Tunica </LOCATION> Cut-off. The 20-mile-long lake was once part of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, which made a meandering loop. In 1942, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> eliminated the loop by plowing a new channel, leaving a lake fed by the river. With the river at its lowest level since records were first kept in 1872, the lake is emptying. The county is losing an estimated $ 20,000 each week on gas, groceries, bait, hardware and other goods the fishermen are n't buying, according to the <LOCATION> Tunica </LOCATION> Cut-off <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> The estimate is based on a <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> study last year on the lake's economic benefits. `` It's pitiful. It's killing us,'' said <PERSON> Tait </PERSON> <PERSON> Selden </PERSON>, 33, owner of one of four fishing camps on the lake. Fishermen normally come from <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> for the lake's bounty of bass, brim, sauger, crappie and catfish. But <PERSON> Selden </PERSON> said his business is off 80 percent. Parking lots that hold 200 cars on a good weekend are barren. `` If this lake was n't here, this town would have dried up and blown away a long time ago,'' <PERSON> Selden </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Selden </PERSON> and his associates want the government to build a dam to keep the lake at an acceptable level. For now, there's nothing but shrinking businesses that match the shrinking lake. <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Daughtry </PERSON>, who raises bugs for bait, says his business is off 40 percent overall and 70 percent on the lake. `` It absolutely scares me to death the future implications of this,'' said the owner of <PERSON> Daughtry </PERSON>'s Cricket Ranch. `` Nobody knows how deep this is going to go.''

<TEXT>
 A judge's decision to throw out a $ 24 million lawsuit that mixed the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, Contras and the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cocaine cartel has left lingering questions, charges of politics, big bills and little doubt that litigation will continue. Chief U.S. District Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> ruled Thursday that the two journalists who filed the suit failed to prove their allegations that the 29 defendants conspired in a guns-for-drugs scheme or a 1984 terrorist bombing in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The defendants included Iran-Contra figures <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>, <PERSON> Contra </PERSON> leader <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> deputy director of operations <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Shackley </PERSON>, and retired major general and anti-communist crusader <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Singlaub </PERSON>. The suit was filed in May 1986, six months before the Iran-Contra affair became public. Many of the people it brought to light, such as <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>, <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> and <PERSON> Singlaub </PERSON>, have been indicted or forced to appear before congressional committees investigating that case. The suit involved heroin smuggling from <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, the `` Phoenix'' assassination program in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, the Bay of Pigs fiasco, cocaine smuggling from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, illegal <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> arms running, bombings, threats, disappearances _ all to push what the plaintiffs believed was a rabid right-wing ideology. On the side of the journalists, <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Avirgan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Honey </PERSON>, was the liberal, Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> Christic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> and their attorney, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON>, a veteran of suits on behalf of radiation victim <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Silkwood </PERSON> and against the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION>. Both sides say politics was at the root of the case, which was to go to trial Monday. `` I think it was 100 percent political,'' says <PERSON> Singlaub </PERSON>. `` I think their real agenda is to discredit the intelligence service, discredit the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration in general and to discredit <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' The vice president led the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> at the time <PERSON> Shackley </PERSON> was allegedly involved in the conspiracy, and later while vice president, the <PERSON> Christics </PERSON> said, his office was aware of arms smuggling to the Contras. The <ORGANIZATION> Christic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> explanation is a mirror image of <PERSON> Singlaub </PERSON>'s. They say the politics involved was not theirs, but rather that of the judge who favored the defendants and people in the government who pressured him to protect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` I believe what has happened here is that this ruling is not a legal ruling, it's a political ruling,'' said <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, director of the institute. `` The judge did n't want a political drama in his courtroom before the election.'' Both sides agree more litigation is in the wings. `` I have under active consideration plans to sue <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> for libel,'' said <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>. `` This suit ... has been from the beginning preposterous. Everyone thinks it's absurd and defaming and malicious.'' <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> is taking <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s decision to an appeals court but says he would be delighted to be the center of a libel trial. `` We'd be right back in court with all our witnesses and all our documents,'' he said. One reason the defendants are threatening countersuits is to recover the ruinously expensive costs of attending hearings, responding to voluminous motions, reading thousands of documents and taking depositions from hundreds of witnesses. The witness list submitted for the trial had more than 2,000 names. <PERSON> Singlaub </PERSON> said he spent more than $ 250,000 on his own defense, and his attorney, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>, said the defendants collectively spent $ 1 million. It cost the <ORGANIZATION> Christic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> even more, $ 3 million, according Ms. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>. According to the suit, <PERSON> Shackley </PERSON> and others, using drug profits, assassinated officials first in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, then <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and other nations. The key event in the suit was the May 1984 bombing of a news conference held by <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> commander <PERSON> Eden </PERSON> <PERSON> Pastora </PERSON> in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Three journalists and five <PERSON> Pastora </PERSON> supporters died in the explosion. <PERSON> Avirgan </PERSON> was hurt and his camera damaged in the explosion, allowing him to file a civil damage suit under federal law. The suit charged the bombing was arranged by <PERSON> Shackley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Contra </PERSON> leaders and others angered that <PERSON> Pastora </PERSON> refused to join anti-Sandinista groups he considered too close to the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and deposed Nicaraguan dictator <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> <PERSON> Debayle </PERSON>.

The administration is looking for the sixth straight year of economic expansion, coupled with low inflation, to bolster Republican chances at the polls this November. <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON>, who was criticized as too optimistic late last year when he predicted strong, steady growth for 1988, issued new projections in the past week that look even better. He boosted his prediction of overall economic growth as measured by the gross national product from 2.9 percent _ the same as 1986 and 1987 _ to 3.5 percent. He cut his unemployment rate forecast from 5.8 percent to 5.5 percent and stuck to his estimate of consumer price inflation, 4.3 percent, the same as last year. `` This expansion, already in its precedent-breaking 67th month, now gives every indication of continuing at least through the end of this administration and on into next year,'' he said. Private economists, who six months ago accused <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON> of looking at the world through rose-colored glasses, now concede that his growth projections then were, if anything, too conservative. The lasting shock to consumer buying that economists thought would come from the October stock market crash never really materialized and some say even the administration's new and higher growth estimate is on target, even as they are more concerned about the inflation outlook. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s latest report on <ORGANIZATION> GNP </ORGANIZATION> said booming exports and a sharp increase in modernization and expansion spending by businesses pushed growth to 3.6 percent in the first quarter of this year after even stronger growth of 4.8 percent in the last quarter of 1987. Private analysts, however, part company with <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON>'s prediction that inflation will hold steady at about the same level as last year <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, head of an economic consulting firm in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, called the inflation numbers: `` Pie in the sky stuff.'' <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Straszheim </PERSON>, chief economist of <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION>, said the economy has `` really done better than anybody has a right to expect'' in making the transition from consumer-led to export-driven growth. But, he said the administration ca n't ignore the inflationary effect of the drought scorching the nation's midsection. Coming increases in the price of food, which accounts for one-fifth of all consumer purchases, likely will boost inflation to at least 5 percent, he said. <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON> agreed the severity of the rise in food prices remains uncertain, but said he has allowed for temporary increases. He said that packaging and distribution account for far more of the retail price of food than crop prices, and argued food prices were unlikely to add significantly to the underlying inflation rate because food represents only about 2 percent of GNP. However, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, chief economist of <ORGANIZATION> Aubrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a government securities dealer, said a stiff jolt to food prices runs the risk of triggering `` inflation psychology'' that spills over into other sectors of the economy, just as the run up in oil prices did in the 1970s. `` The shading of the administration's estimates on inflation may involve at least some election-year politics in addition to economic analysis,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. `` What the administration is trying to do is present a picture of strong economic growth and low inflation as we come into an election.''

 Here is the text of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s weekly radio address, as delivered Saturday from the White House. My fellow Americans, this past week I traveled to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> for my eighth economic summit with leaders of the industrialized democracies. The summit produced important results. We agreed on a plan to provide debt relief for some of the poorest countries of the world, we moved important agricultural reform negotiations forward, and we rededicated our nations to combatting the modern-day evils of airplane hijackings, terrorism, and illegal drugs. It's this last matter _ the fight against illegal drugs _ that I'd like to take a moment to discuss with you this afternoon. This past week's meeting in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> was n't the first time the drug problem had been discussed among my summit colleagues. At the 1985 summit in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, we established an expert group to identify areas for enhancing the effectiveness and cooperation in fighting the scourge of illegal drugs. The expert group presented its report at our 1986 summit in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, and the report proved useful in setting our countries on a path of cooperation in combatting drug abuse and illicit drug-trafficking. Now, the summit leaders have supported an initiative for a special group launched by Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Canadian Prime Minister <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> that would extend and promote the work done by the <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> summit. This group will propose methods to improve international cooperation in combatting production, trafficking, and financing of the drug trade. I'm hopeful this group can identify measures for a major coordinated assault on drugs, but today the battle against drugs extends far beyond the seven industrialized democracies represented in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>. Just one year ago, 138 nations _ members of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> _ met in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> to participate in the historic <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION> and Illicit Trafficking. This conference proved a resounding success in bringing together representatives from around the globe. Each of the participating governments declared its commitment to vigorous action against drug abuse and illicit drug-trafficking. Perhaps even more important, the 138 nations adopted a comprehensive outline of activities all nations can undertake to fight illegal drugs. These activities include the reduction of demand for illegal drugs, the suppression of illicit drug production and trafficking, and the treatment and rehabilitation of drug-dependent people. One suggestion coming out of the <ORGANIZATION> UN </ORGANIZATION> conference was the recommendation for a commemorative day, an international day against drug abuse and illicit trafficking. The <ORGANIZATION> UN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> then set aside June 26th to serve as this day of observance. Around the world, nations will join the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> commemorating the international fight against drugs, and I'm pleased that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will be among them. Attorney General <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, who headed our delegation to the conference in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, will host a ceremony to draw attention to the international day and to reaffirm the commitment of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to a drug-free <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and yes, a drug-free world. Here at home this past week, the White House Conference for a <LOCATION> Drug-Free </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> released its report. This document included more than 100 recommendations for combatting drug-abuse and illicit drug-trafficking. We'll be giving these recommendations careful consideration in the days ahead. And there's another important anti-drug effort underway here at home _ it was on May 18th that I called on, to use my own words, `` both Houses of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, both sides of the aisle, to join with my representatives in a special executive legislative task force to advance <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s unified response to the problem of illegal drug use,'' end quote. My goal is to combine the expertise of the executive and legislative branches to identify the next steps we should take to stop the illegal use, distribution, and production of drugs, and to begin taking these steps on a bipartisan basis. I'm sure you'll agree, the drug problem is a national problem that demands national solutions and is too important for us to permit partisan bickering. I was pleased that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> minority leaders, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, appointed their representatives to the task force, and I urge the speaker of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the majority leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to appoint their own representatives quickly so we can get to work. Next week, my <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> will recommend specific proposals that would be important to any new drug legislation. Today, illegal drug use is down in our high schools, cocaine and heroin seizures are up, and perhaps most important, attitudes about illegal drugs have changed. But, we're working on, working to make our beloved land what we know it ought to be and can be, a truly drug-free <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Until next week, thanks for listening, and God bless you.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> urged Democratic congressional leaders Saturday to appoint representatives to work with the administration on the drug problem, saying it is `` too important for us to permit partisan bickering.''

 A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> helicopter slammed into a hillside and burned Saturday while flying in fog near a nuclear power plant, and all seven Marines on board were killed, officials said. The Sikorsky CH-53D Sea Stallion crashed about 30 minutes after leaving the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Iwakuni </LOCATION>, in southwestern <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, said Sgt. <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> of the station's public affairs office. Names of the victims were withheld pending notification of their families. Cloudy skies and dense fog were reported in the area at the time of the crash on the southwest tip of <LOCATION> Shikoko </LOCATION> island, but it was n't immediately known if the weather contributed to the accident Since 1980, at least 88 people have died in accidents involving the Sea Stallion, or the later-model Super Stallion, the largest and most expensive helicopter used by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military. Television footage showed Japanese and American rescue workers carrying bodies in sacks over terraced rice paddies less than two miles from a nuclear power station. Fog swirled around the hill where the aircraft crashed and burned, and it appeared to be raining lightly. The wreckage was scattered over a wide area, according to a local police official who identified himself only as <PERSON> Sakamoto </PERSON>. Japanese aviation law prohibits aircraft from flying over nuclear power stations and other nuclear-related facilities. There are about 30 such facilities in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The law also says that aircraft which must fly over such facilities due to bad weather or to avoid a collision, must take the least hazardous course or altitude. A Japanese <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> official said in a telephone interview that he saw `` little problem'' with the helicopter's flight path. `` We noticed the copter took a course several kilometers away from the plant,'' despite the poor visibility in the area at the time of the accident, said the official, who refused to be named. The Marines were flying to their base at <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Futenma </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION>, 580 miles away, where they were assigned to <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heavy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helicopter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Squadron </ORGANIZATION> 402 of the <ORGANIZATION> 1st </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wing </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has about 20,000 Marines stationed in <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION>. The Sea Stallion left <LOCATION> Iwakuni </LOCATION>, about 700 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, at 9:50 a.m. and crashed at about 10:20 a.m., <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> said. The CH-53D is capable of carrying up to 55 troops or a cargo of 32,000 pounds. The single-rotor, twin-engine aircraft is made by the <LOCATION> Stratford </LOCATION>, Conn.-based <ORGANIZATION> Sikorsky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> division of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The helicopter has had a series of operational problems and fatal crashes. In November 1985, the military grounded the helicopters after mechanics in a routine inspection discovered a defect in the locknut that helps hold the rotor blade assembly to the aircraft. <PERSON> Sikorsky </PERSON>'s former chief safety engineer alleged in a March 1987 court affidavit that metal mounts on the tail rotor gearbox of the helicopter have failed or been suspected of failing an estimated 60 times since 1968. Sikorsky attorneys said the man was a disgruntled former employee who was using internal company documents in violation of his contract. Three Marines died in a Feb. 13, 1987 accident involving a Sea Stallion helicopter in the <LOCATION> Trabuco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION> area near <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Toro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. In July 1985, a CH-53D crashed off <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, killing four Marines. In May 1985, 17 Marines were presumed killed when their Sea Stallion crashed into the ocean off <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s southern coast. And in March 1984, a Sea Stallion slammed into a mountainside in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, and all 18 Americans and 11 South Koreans were killed. In 1983, seven people died in two accidents. In addition, five were killed in 1982 in one crash, nine in 1981 in four accidents, and seven in 1980 in four accidents.

 Here is the text of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s weekly radio address, as delivered Saturday by Rep. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Boxer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>: This is Congresswoman <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Boxer </PERSON> from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> I'd like to talk to you about the Pentagon scandal, and why <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is deeply troubled by it. You've heard about scandals before. But this one is different. It strikes at the heart of our national security, and, I believe, was fueled by a consistent message by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration that government is our enemy and big defense business our friend. If the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> is right, then secret information worth tens of billions has been traded by military insiders and defense contractors to line their pockets and undermine the competitive system that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has mandated. Why has this happened? I do n't agree with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> that it's `` understandable.'' Do you? Or with <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> who says there's nothing wrong with the system, it's just a few individuals. Where is the outrage? Where is the concern? The root cause of this scandal was alluded to more than 20 years ago by a president from the military, <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>. He warned about the unwarranted influence of the military-industrial complex, and the need for `` an alert citizenry'' to protect against it. I want you to be an alert citizenry. I want you to know what has gone on since this administration came to power in 1980. First, the military budget increased 100 percent from $ 150 billion to $ 300 billion today. Money was literally stuffed into the Pentagon with too little attention paid to cost or quality _ as if money alone could buy us security. We need a strong defense, but we must control wasteful spending. I want you to know that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has passed reforms. Each time we were told by the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to butt out. But we said it was the people's business. In 1984 we showed them the $ 7,000 coffee pot and asked for reform. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said that was an isolated incident. So we showed them the $ 600 toilet seat, the $ 300 no-smoking sign, the $ 9,000 <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> wrench. All isolated incidents, they said. But we passed legislation to force competition on the $ 18 billion spare parts budget. But we knew there was more _ lots more. We said the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and defense contractors were too cozy. The Pentagon said no. But we passed revolving door legislation, stopping military procurement officers from retiring and going to to work on Friday for the very same contractors they investigated on Thursday. Over Pentagon objections, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed strong whistleblower protection for those brave people who speak out about fraud and waste. This whole scandal unfolded because a whistleblower had the guts to speak out. In 1986, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> mandated a procurement czar to straighten out the mess. An honorable man took the job but quit, frustrated that he was fighting _ and losing _ every time. We legislated some good old-fashioned competition, and we said enough to buying from monopolies. But the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, the contractors, and the administration did n't like it They howled. They were unabashed in their contempt toward congressional reforms. They continued to try to water them down, repeal them or ignore them. Now, in this tterrible scandal there has apparently been the ultimate contempt _ as many as 50 consultants buying secret information to destroy competition and cheat all of us. It is difficult to see six years of bipartisan work foiled by what one news magazine calls `` a conspiracy of greed.'' But we will learn from this and you, alert citizens, can help. Let us send a message through our votes that we've had enough of pouring billions into a bottomless money pit. Let us send a message through our votes that we want an ethical and honorable independent procurement system. You know, the code name for this <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation is `` Ill Wind.'' Let's turn this ill wind into winds of change _ for all of us. It's about time, do n't you think?

<HEAD>Bar Owners Struggle With Rules For Last Day Of 19-, 20-Year-Old
Drinking</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> on Friday becomes the last state to raise its drinking age to 21, confronting bar owners with a dilemma _ what to do about 19 - and 20-year-olds who come in legally Thursday night and suddenly become too young to drink The Legislature earlier this year acceded to federal pressure to raise the drinking age from 19 to 21. The increase takes effect at 12:01 a.m. Friday. But state law allows bars to remain open until 2 a.m., and 19-and 20-year-olds expected to turn out in force Thursday night for their last chance for a legal drink. `` It takes effect at 12:01 a.m. July 1 and from that point on, a bar operator can not sell to or allow someone 19 and 20 to drink in their establishment,'' said Attorney General <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>. `` So they had better clear the tables.'' Complicating the issue is that the law is written in such a way that, unless city ordinances say otherwise, those ages 19 and 20 can still be inside a liquor establishment after the age limit changes. `` It's going to create an unenforceable object,'' said Police Chief <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierson </PERSON>. `` It will be totally impossible for us to enforce a law that allows 19 - and 20-year-olds in, but does n't let them drink The biggest problem is for the bar owner himself, because it is his responsibility to make sure they do not drink.'' Bar owners can be fined $ 35 to $ 750 and receive up to six months in jail for allowing underage drinking. Drinkers 18 and under are handled as juvenile offenders; those 19 and 20 will face the same punishment as bar owners, said police Sgt. <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> <PERSON> Luna </PERSON>. Many communities around the state are working to enact ordinances to prohibit those under 21 from entering bars. Bars and taverns also have the option of not letting in anyone under 21. `` Our option is right now to make it a day early here,'' said <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilgore </PERSON>, assistant food and beverage director for the Hitching Post Inn in <LOCATION> Cheyenne </LOCATION>. `` We do have the option to refuse service to anybody, so instead of going through the headaches of getting 19-and 20-year-olds out of here after they've been drinking all night, our plan ... is we'll cut it off June 29.'' <PERSON> Kilgore </PERSON> said another option is simply to close the bar at midnight Thursday. <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> McCue </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Wyoming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liquor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, also said many bar owners might just close their establishements to those under 21 to avoid problems. `` Most people prefer that we do n't allow 19-year-olds in because it is too hard to control,'' he said. `` We have to police our own places ... we are the law enforcement. `` It is very difficult to keep someone from ordering a pitcher of beer and not keep someone from pouring a glass for -LRB- an underage -RRB- friend they are talking to. We are hoping the cities enact ordinances that will take care of that situation.'' <ORGANIZATION> Cheyenne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> manager <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambousis </PERSON>, who plans to keep entertaining people ages 19 and 20, said the two-hour gap should not be much trouble. `` Normally we are not that busy on a Thursday, so we will identify them with a stamp and let them drink and by midnight, there should just be a handful of those people,'' he said. `` Instead of leaving at 1 or 2 -LRB- a.m. -RRB-, they can cut the party short a little bit.''

 Celebrity divorce lawyer <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchelson </PERSON> vowed to vigorously defend himself against state bar association allegations that he mishandled clients' money. <PERSON> Mitchelson </PERSON>, who made legal history in the mid-1970s by pressing the historic `` palimony'' case of actor <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON>'s former girlfriend, could face sanctions ranging from a warning up to disbarment if the complaints against him are upheld. The State Bar's trial counsel office filed documents Friday contending there was reasonable cause to hold a disciplinary hearing. <PERSON> Mitchelson </PERSON>, 60, divorce attorney for such luminaries as <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, said the bar singled him out because `` I'm highly visible.'' `` Nevertheless I will vigorously defend myself against these charges as I have defended every case I've ever had,'' <PERSON> Mitchelson </PERSON> said by phone from <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. He added that `` all these complaints are old complaints and at least two of them have been previously rejected by the State Bar.'' Among those who filed complaints were actress <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Newmar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Revson </PERSON>, sister-in-law of the founder of <ORGANIZATION> Revlon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cosmetics </ORGANIZATION>. They complained that <PERSON> Mitchelson </PERSON> took retainers from them and delayed or refused to return unearned portions of the fees after they fired him for alleged deception, the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Saturday. The bar association also charged that <PERSON> Mitchelson </PERSON> failed to deposit clients' funds in trust accounts, charged unconscionable fees, failed to perform promised work and lied to a client.

 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s top surviving World War II ace says he fought in the same area as Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> but does n't know if the two ever squared off in aerial combat. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> pilot flying bombers in the <LOCATION> Bonin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> area of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> about the same time that <PERSON> Saburo </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakai </PERSON> was trying to shoot such planes down in 1944. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was shot down on Sept. 2, 1944.

<HEAD>Soviets Says Their Warning on Afghan Pullout Meant As Pressure

<TEXT>
 A Foreign Ministry official indicated Saturday that the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> never intended to halt its troop withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, as it threatened, and was only trying to put pressure on Afghan rebel supporters. The comments by Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Yuli </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> seemed designed to put to rest speculation that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> might slow or stop withdrawing its troops from <LOCATION> Afghanstan </LOCATION> because of alleged violations of the accord providing for the withdrawal. He indicated the warnings were directed more at putting pressure on <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, which supports the rebels, than signaling any Soviet backtracking. `` We are appealing to the conscience of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s leaders,'' <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> said at a news conference, speaking through an interpreter. `` We believe that the leaders of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> will realize their responsibility and that the world's public will help them take awareness of their responsibilty.'' <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON>, who helped negotiate the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords, also called on reporters to investigate alleged Pakistani violations of the accord, signed April 14. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has been complaining almost daily that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s arms shipments to guerrillas fighting <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s government and that the location of rebel training bases in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> violate the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> cited specific examples of alleged <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistani </LOCATION> support for the rebels. He said a Pakistani general, <PERSON> Sarfaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON>, is in charge of a camp near the village of <LOCATION> Kalan </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, where 2,500 rebels are training. American advisers are also at the camp, <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> said. The first Soviet warning of retaliation came May 28, when the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said that if <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> did not halt `` interference in the internal affairs of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>,'' the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would `` draw pertinent conclusions with respect to the timetable of the troop withdrawal and take concrete steps.'' Under the accords, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> began pulling out its more than 100,000 troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on May 15 and is supposed to have half of them out by Aug. 15. The pullout is to be completed by Feb. 15. Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and Afghan President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> warned after a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> meeting on June 13 that Pakistani violations of the accord would bring `` resolute retaliatory steps.'' <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuznetsov </PERSON>, deputy head of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> desk in the Soviet Foreign Ministry, said in an interview the next day that the warning meant the withdrawing Soviet troops would strike back at <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> guerrillas who attack them. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been supplying the Afghan rebels with an estimated $ 500 million annually in arms and military supplies channeled through <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. It has vowed to continue the supplies as long as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> keeps up its military support of the Afghan government. The <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords prohibit Pakistani interference in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s affairs. But weapons supply from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is not banned. A separate agreement signed by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> allows them to continue supplying their respective allies. Soviet troops intervened in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979 following a communist coup there the previous year.

 Protesters disrupted a performance of a play critical of the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s role in dealing with the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> and said the production was improper during the papal visit to <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. `` This whole play is a just a lie!'' about 50 protesters shouted late Friday during a performance of German author <PERSON> Rolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hochhuth </PERSON>'s play, `` The Deputy. Police took two protesters into custody. The incident occurred on the second day of Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hochhuth </PERSON>'s play, first performed in 1963 in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, alleges that then-Pope <PERSON> Pius </PERSON> <PERSON> XII </PERSON> failed to do enough to prevent the Nazi Holocaust. `` If I were writing the play again today, I would not present the personage of Pope <PERSON> Pius </PERSON> <PERSON> XII </PERSON> so favorably,'' <PERSON> Hochhuth </PERSON> said later during an informal discussion with the audience. The play already is very critical of <PERSON> Pius </PERSON> <PERSON> XII </PERSON>. The play's assistant director, <PERSON> Hermann </PERSON> <PERSON> Beil </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview that the demonstrators, predominantly young people, shouted and used whistles to attract attention during the performance at <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>'s Burgtheater. <PERSON> Beil </PERSON> said some in the audience shouted back at the protesters: `` Out with the Nazis!'' The actors occasionally stopped to ask for silence. About 350 people were in the audience during the disruptions, <PERSON> Beil </PERSON> said. The protesters called themselves `` The Young Friends of the Burgtheater'' and distributed leaflets calling for the ouster of theater director <PERSON> Claus </PERSON> <PERSON> Peymann </PERSON>. `` Out with Peymann,'' some chanted. Peymann himself told the audience later, `` I think it ` s great that a public forum can arise in this theater. Perhaps the theater today has the function of presenting those questions that politics no longer deal with.'' Although critics reacted coolly to the play, it became a hit and sparked impassioned debate over the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s role before and during World War II. In addition to <PERSON> Hochhuth </PERSON>, many Jewish leaders allege the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> failed to do enough to prevent the mass murder of European Jews. But the current pope has strongly defended the church's role during the Nazi era. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> even brought up the subject on the current trip. `` The incomprehensible pain, suffering and tears still are before my eyes and etched deep in my soul,'' the pontiff said Friday in reference to the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> murder of 6 million Jews. But he continued: `` It would be clearly unjust and untrue to charge Christianity with these unspeakable crimes.'' The theater's production of the play sparked controversy last March, when it was performed at the time the Austrians were marking the 50th anniversary of the country's annexation by <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> agreed Saturday to an overhaul of <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> rules and avoided the possibility of a contentious floor fight at next month's national convention. Under the agreement, the number of `` super delegates'' to the 1992 convention will be cut nearly in half and all other delegates would be awarded to presidential candidates in proportion to public support. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, meeting Saturday with local campaign officials in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, said the agreement represented `` a victory for the people ... a victory for democracy.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had complained that party rules did not allow him to get the delegates he said were warranted by his popular support. He had said that he would carry his fight to the convention floor to get the rules changed. `` I think that we've made a lot of steps forward in a lot of areas that Rev. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has been concerned about,'' said <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Ickes </PERSON>, who negotiated for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on the rules changes. Of the 643 super delegates to the convention, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who won 29 percent of the vote in the primaries, had just 55. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who won 57 percent of the vote, had 362, according to The Associated Press delegate count. The super delegates _ party leaders and politicians who automatically hold seats as convention delegates _ are not bound to support a presidential candidate based on results of the primaries or caucuses. And while the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has no `` winner-take-all'' states, it does have a few states in which direct election of delegates or `` winner-take-more'' systems are used. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> used both of those aspects of the party's rules to give him the margin of delegates he needed to clinch the Democratic presidential nomination. He also intensively sought support from super delegates, often making telephone calls to them himself. Currently, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has 2,384 delegates overall while <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has 1,132. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign supported the rules changes, but <PERSON> Tad </PERSON> <PERSON> Devine </PERSON>, director of delegate selection for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, said it was not being done to buy peace with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` Hardly,'' <PERSON> Devine </PERSON> said. `` I think it represents a compromise on the part of both campaigns. It reflects a spirit of cooperation and good will.'' The harmony between the two campaigns meant that the party's Rules Committee meeting this weekend was being cut from two days to one and probably would issue no dissenting reports when its business was finished, <PERSON> Devine </PERSON> said Both campaigns said the negotiations had been going on for several days and stretched into the early hours of Saturday morning. However, occasional snags were still being worked out on some issued during the Rules Committee meeting, as a dozen or so representatives of the campaigns talked in a tight huddle at the back of the room. The 186-member committee approved the rules changes on Saturday without dissent, but the proposals still need to be ratified by the full convention next month in order to take effect for the 1992 presidential campaign. `` Though adoption of this proposal does n't put us in the promised land, it puts us further down the road,'' said <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Bracy </PERSON>, a committee member and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporter from <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbor </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, of reducing the strength of super delegates. Rep. <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, D-Ky., kept the metaphor: `` This may not be the promised land, but it does represent some milk and honey. <PERSON> Devine </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did use the current system to his advantage but still would have won the nomination even if the proposed rules changes were in place. `` I do n't deny that we took a look at the delegate selection process in 1988 and developed strategies based on the way the process is structured,'' <PERSON> Devine </PERSON> said. Under the proposed changes, the number of super delegates would be reduced to 394 by denying automatic delegate status to most members of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Automatic delegate status would be reserved for Democratic governors, most members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and top two party leaders in each state and the party's national officers The system would return to rules used in 1984, when <ORGANIZATION> DNC </ORGANIZATION> members had priority for seats at the convention but had to compete for them and had to declare a presidential preference. Super delegates currently represent about 15 percent of the delegates to the convention. Under the proposed rules, that would be cut to about 10 percent. In addition, states such as <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, which picked their national convention delegates directly from the primary ballot, would be compelled to adopt systems to award the delegates proportionally. Another handful of states, including <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, award extra delegates to the candidate receiving the most votes in their primaries, and those systems, too, would have to be changed in four years. The agreement also called for nudging states toward picking new <ORGANIZATION> DNC </ORGANIZATION> members based on whom they support for president and in proportion to results of the primary or caucus in that state. States adopting this rule would be allowed to name one extra member apiece to the <ORGANIZATION> DNC </ORGANIZATION>. In other business Saturday, the committee voted to recognize the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> as a state, giving Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> an automatic seat at the 1988 convention as a governor. The committee, without debate, named <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> as permanent chairman of this year's national convention. No mention was made of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee investigation of some of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s financial dealings.

<HEAD>Sakharov Speaks Out for Monument To Stalin's Victims</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Dissident <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> joined former political prisoners and intellectuals at a rally Saturday to demand a monument to victims of <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. It was <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s first appearance at a street rally in more than a decade. At another demonstration, about 200 people shouted `` Freedom! Freedom!'' and ignored police orders to disperse. Police detained at least three people. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, the Nobel Prize-winning physicist who spent seven years in exile for speaking out against the Soviet government, told 600 people in north <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> that a monument to <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s victims was essential to remembering the country's `` tragic history.'' The rally joined intellectuals who had been jailed or banished from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> during the rule of former Soviet leader <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> and those who are still trying to get their works past conformist censors. Flanked by a sign showing <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> on a big black boot and warning `` He is still dangerous,'' <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> told a silent crowd that `` if we have a memorial, we have to think of everybody who died, in the repression, of hunger ... everybody was a victim.'' Later, at <LOCATION> Pushkin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> in the center of the city, a jostling crowd of 200 refused to allow police to break up a demonstration by the alternative political party, <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. They applauded a man who held up a sign saying `` No to the political police. Break up the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, 67, said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s sad past was symbolized by the December 1986 death in jail of <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Marchenko </PERSON>, a fellow member of a group monitoring human rights in the 1970s. <PERSON> Marchenko </PERSON>'s death is thought by some to have hastened the decision by Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> two weeks later to allow <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Yelena </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON>, to return to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> from their exile in the closed city of <LOCATION> Gorky </LOCATION>. Others who spoke at the rally included former political prisoners <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Kovalev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lev </PERSON> <PERSON> Timofeyev </PERSON>, film director <PERSON> Elem </PERSON> <PERSON> Klimov </PERSON>, historian <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Afanasyev </PERSON> and writers <PERSON> Ales </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamovich </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Karyakin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Karyakin </PERSON> told reporters that the rally `` was a beginning. It was important that there were many young people there.'' A group of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members and non-party intellectuals have collected 30,000 signatures on a petition to a nationwide party conference to approve a monument to the millions killed in <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s purges. The conference begins Tuesday. Groups in the Baltic republic of <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and in the Siberian city of <LOCATION> Chita </LOCATION> have campaigned for such a monument. <PERSON> Klimov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Afanasyev </PERSON> are delegates to the conference and accepted the petition Saturday, promising to raise the issue of a memorial if they are allowed to speak at the 5,000-delegate forum. <PERSON> Timofeyev </PERSON> called for greater openness about the extent of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s purges and proposed that <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON>'s chronicle of Soviet prisons, `` The <LOCATION> Gulag </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Archipelago </LOCATION>,'' be published in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s appearance at the rally marked the first time he has taken part in a street protest since he and his wife campaigned for freedom outside dissidents' trials in the 1970s. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> was exiled to <PERSON> Gorky </PERSON> in January 1980 for speaking out against the Soviet intervention in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. About an hour after the anti-Stalin rally, which was held with official approval, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> tried to hold a demonstration on <LOCATION> Pushkin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>. Police did not intervene at first but later detained <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Mityunov </PERSON> and at least two other people, prompting a shoving match with the crowd of <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> supporters and onlookers. A rally staged by another group, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, was then allowed to go ahead, apparently because they back official policies and are not challenging the monopoly of the Communist party. Police tried to break up the demonstrations by throwing up a cordon dividing them, shouting at citizens to move along and waiting for the rest to disperse gradually. <PERSON> Mityunov </PERSON> said earlier the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, which was set up in May, held a sanctioned meeting for about four hours with 1,000 participants in <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> Friday.

 Former Sen. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Magnuson </PERSON>, whose career in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> spanned 44 years, has been hospitalized after suffering a slight heart attack, his wife said. <PERSON> Magnuson </PERSON>, 83, was taken to <LOCATION> Swedish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> by ambulance after being stricken Friday, said <PERSON> Jermaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Magnuson </PERSON>. Hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Abbi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON> said the former senator was responding to medication Saturday and his condition had stabilized. <PERSON> Magnuson </PERSON> suffers from diabetes, a condition which causes poor circulation. In 1982, three toes on the senator's right foot were amputated after becoming infected. In 1985, his right foot was amputated because of circulation problems. Mrs. <PERSON> Magnuson </PERSON> said her husband began feeling sick Friday afternoon and was diagnosed as having suffered a `` slight'' heart attack Friday evening. He had been scheduled to receive the King County Man of the Year Award from the King County Democrats that night, she said. `` His spirits are up,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Magnuson </PERSON> said. `` He always keeps his sense of humor. He was telling the doctors, ` Oh, here you guys go poking on me again.''' <PERSON> Magnuson </PERSON> was first elected to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1936 and served four terms, interrupted by eight months' service with the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> during World War II. He won his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat in 1944 and was re-elected five times before being defeated by Republican <PERSON> Slade </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorton </PERSON> in 1980.

<HEAD>Yeast Infection Remedy Nearly Burns Down House, Authorities Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST JORDAN, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A woman following a newspaper story's advice to yeast infection sufferers tossed her underpants in the microwave and sparked a fire, authorities say Firefighters rushed to the woman's home in this south <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> community of 27,000 on Friday morning and quickly extinguished the flames, but not before her microwave oven was destroyed and a nearby wall scorched, said County Fire Chief <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON>. <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> said when the embarassed woman explained how the fire started, firefighters were hard-pressed not to laugh. `` It's one of those things that ` Just when you think you've seen everything ...,''' <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> said. However, <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> said the incident's humorous side was tempered by its potential for developing into a serious fire if it had not quickly been extinguished. There were no injuries. <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> said the woman, who was not identified, decided to `` cook'' her underpants after reading a news service article in a local paper quoting <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> obstetrics and gynecology researchers as saying the bacteria responsible for yeast infections can be killed in a microwave oven in five minutes on the high-power setting. The article emphasized the process only works on cotton underpants, and also recommended the underwear be freshly laundered and slightly damp. The woman was certain the underwear that caught on fire was 100 percent cotton, but fire officials believe they were probably of an artificial material. If the underpants were indeed cotton, the elastic material may have been to blame, they said. <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> said that after seeing what happened to the woman's kitchen, he could not recommend the microwave process `` I just would n't do it,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> article said yeast bacteria can also be killed by soaking or boiling underwear in bleach, or by ironing. Common detergents will not kill the bacteria. Antibiotics can fight the actual yeast infection, but women tend to become reinfected, possibly from wearing contaminated underwear, the article said.

<HEAD>Top Soviets Criticize Brezhnev Foreign Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Top Soviet officials, including the military chief of staff, said Saturday that serious mistakes were made in foreign policy under the late <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> chief <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>. The officials told reporters the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> allowed itself to be provoked by the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, did n't consider political options before resorting to force in conflicts and mishandled public relations. `` We were too carried away by polemics, scoring points, polemic points, propaganda points. Indeed, the propaganda proponent very often was in the way of real work,'' said <PERSON> Yuli </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON>, who was a top official in the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and ambassador to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> under <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>. He became First Deputy Foreign Minister in 1986. The unusual self-criticism came at a news conference to discuss foreign policy issues on the agenda for Tuesday's 19th <ORGANIZATION> All-Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, a meeting of 5,000 <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members who will review Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s programs. A British reporter asked what foreign policy mistakes the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> made during what <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> officials refer to as `` the period of stagnation'' _ the latter years of <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s 1964-1982 rule. During that period, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> sent troops into <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> to quash reforms, responded to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s deployment of medium-range missiles in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> by deploying its own missiles, and sent troops into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` In the 70s and the early 80s, we used to be too forthright in our reaction to the arms race pursued by the West,'' said Marshal <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON>, who held top military posts under <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> and was made chief of staff and deputy defense minister in 1984. But he said the West should share the blame for the arms race. `` It was the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration that started that in the early 80s. I think we had to show more initiative in finding political solutions, political ways of reacting to the dizzying growth of the military budget in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON> told reporters. Since coming to power in March 1985, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has done an about-face on several of <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s foreign policy moves. He signed an accord with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to eliminate medium-range missiles worldwide and started the withdrawal of Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. He has not directly criticized the invasion of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> but has said each socialist country has the right to develop independently. The Brezhnev Doctrine, the policy the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> used to justify the Czechoslovak invasion, holds that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has the right to intervene in a threatened socialist country. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, under his policy of `` glasnost,'' has encouraged a reexamination of Soviet history to correct mistakes of the past. <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>, now the Soviet president, was in charge of Soviet foreign policy as foreign minister for all of <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s rule <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> was asked at Saturday's news conference if <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> was to blame for foreign policy mistakes. <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> refused to criticize the 78-year-old diplomat. `` Mistakes, shortcomings, drawbacks in our foreign policy at the time of stagnation certainly were related to people and the overall spirit that reigned supreme at that time,'' <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> said. `` All of us who worked at the foreign office at the time to different, varying extents, depending on our responsibilities are to blame for the mistakes and shortcomings of that time.'' <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Primakov </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economy </ORGANIZATION> and International Relations, said the `` major drawback'' in Brezhnev-era Soviet foreign policy was not considering enough options before a decision was taken. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Bovin </PERSON>, a prominent political commentator, wrote June 15 in the government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> that the Soviet intervention in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> deployment of SS-20 missiles in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> were examples of mistaken use of excessive military force that damaged the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s international prestige.

<HEAD>Doctors To Debate Proposals On AIDS, Medicaid Reform At AMA
Convention</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Doctors will debate proposals for battling AIDS, overhauling Medicaid and training a new type of bedside hospital worker this week at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s annual policymaking convention. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delegates </ORGANIZATION>, which convenes Sunday, also plan to discuss a proposed ban on selling plastic handguns, a move to put warning labels on alcoholic beverages and the association's stand on mercy killing. The meeting, which runs through Thursday, is expected to attract up to 2,000 doctors from across the country. The 420 delegates represent the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION>'s 295,000 members and act as a legislature, setting policy for the nation's largest organization of physicians. The delegates will receive more than 75 reports on problems ranging from child pornography to the health hazards of clove cigarettes. They also will consider at least 155 resolutions on such issues as the health risks of tanning parlors and ways to revamp the nation's <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> health insurance system for the elderly. `` AIDS, of course, is the biggest threatening health problem in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> president Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hotchkiss </PERSON>, a surgeon from <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said last week. `` There is still considerable debate that I think will take place over the issue of testing.'' One resolution, proposed by a group of delegates from <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, recommends requiring state and local health departments to contact the sexual partners of anyone who tests positive for the AIDS virus. The proposal also recommends that all immigrants and inmates be tested for the virus and calls for a national catastrophic health insurance program for AIDS victims and legislation to protect them from discrimination. The <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trustees </ORGANIZATION> is proposing a major overhaul of Medicaid, the nation's program for helping the poor pay for medical care. An <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> report says the program, administered by state governments, is fraught with `` severe inequities.'' Its calls for expanding Medicaid to cover an additional 27 million people at or below the poverty level now excluded because eligibility varies from state to state. A battle may erupt over the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> trustees' proposal to help offset the nationwide shortage of nurses by creating a new class of hospital workers to provide some bedside care to patients. Several nurses associations oppose the plan to create licensed `` registered care technologists.'' Under the plan, high school graduates could begin caring for patients as assistant technologists with two months' training. They could become basic technologists with an additional seven months' training and advanced technologists after nine more months of study. Their duties would include bathing patients, giving out medication and changing bandages. `` This is in no way a substitute for nurses,'' <PERSON> Hotchkiss </PERSON> said. `` It is in addition to nurses.'' Also up for debate are resolutions calling on the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> to oppose so-called mercy killing or euthanasia by doctors and `` refrain from publishing articles which involve the taking of human life'' without stating the group's position. The Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> was criticized earlier this year when it published an article by an unidentified doctor describing how he ended the life of a terminally ill cancer patient.

 A bomb destroyed a hotel in the center of this northwestern frontier city Saturday and killed 13 people, police said. Officials blamed government agents from neighboring <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Devout Moslems had just finished morning prayers shortly after sunrise when the bomb exploded, tearing through the three-story hotel and tearoom in the old section of the city, said <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, assistant inspector of crimes. `` It collapsed just like a sandwich,'' said khan. Rescuers pulled out the bodies from the ruins of the hotel. Two people survived nine hours under the rubble but died on the way to the hospital, police said. Those killed included an Afghan woman and her 3-year-old child, said <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Amer </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Pakistani </LOCATION> journalist who visited the scene. The woman had come to <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION> for medical treatment, he said. The blast injured four people. Three were treated and released from the hospital. There was no word on the condition of the fourth. The seven-party Afghan guerrilla alliance, which is fighting to overthrow the <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> government, has its headquarters in <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>, 30 miles from the Afghan border. The deputy inspector general of police, <PERSON> Kamal </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON>, said officers in the city regularly search of people, parcels and vehicles and that terrorists target places such as hotels, where baggage is seldom checked. Police said they suspected that agents of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s Communist government were responsible for the blast `` Previously they have committed all these things,'' <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> said, referring to dozens of terrorist bombings over the past two years in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Hundreds of Pakistanis and Afghan refugees have died in the blasts. The chief minister of <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION> province, <PERSON> Fazle </PERSON> <PERSON> Haq </PERSON>, told a press conference that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s support for more than 3 million Afghan refugees and Afghan guerrillas has made the area a target for terrorists. But he promised <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> wo n't end its support for the guerrillas, who also have received support from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. On Friday, small explosive devices went off outside the headquarters of two Afghan resistance parties but there were no serious injuries, said <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>. Until Friday, <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION> had been enjoying a respite from terrorist bombings, which had become almost a weekly occurance prior to the signing of the April 14 <ORGANIZATION> Geneva </ORGANIZATION> accord on the withdrawal of Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The Soviets intervened in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979. Under the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accord, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> agreed to withdraw its troops over a nine-month period, beginning May 15 and ending Feb. 15, 1989. The withdrawal began on schedule. The Soviet-backed <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government said only Soviet troops, not Soviet military advisers, will leave.

 Authorities confiscated more than 500 pounds of cocaine after a light plane believed to be from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> made a forced landing during a storm, police said Saturday. National Police press officer <PERSON> Vicente </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortiz </PERSON> said the seizure, made Tuesday, was the biggest in Salvadoran history.

Police said the pilot, hampered by poor visibility, knocked down electrical wires as he came in for a landing.

Ms. <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>, 54, is known as a fiery populist with a quick wit. She said she does not know why she would be considered for keynote speaker, although she added, `` I'm sure the fact that I have been a Democrat all my life and active in the party, and the fact that I am the first female in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to hold public office statewide in 50 years'' played a part. Official announcement of the keynote speaker is expected to be made early next week. The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta Constitution, in their combined Saturday editions, reported that two sources _ both requesting anonymity _ said the party and likely nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> have agreed on Ms. <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>.

But <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s press secretary, said <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> would not deny that Ms. <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> is on a short list that he will discuss with party leaders this weekend.

They are, most of them, Democrats,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> said she could not speculate how being the convention's keynote speaker would affect her decision to run for governor in 1990. `` I'm always pleased to be recognized and to have an opportunity for some visibility,'' she said. Other politicians who had been mentioned as potential keynote speakers, such as <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON>, Sen. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Bumpers </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, also have been considered leading choices for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' running mate.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> observed the 38th anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean War on Saturday with nationwide rallies denouncing Communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Officials said hundreds of thousands of people, led by veterans and anti-communist organizations, attended rallies and memorial services across the country. No overall tally was available. <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> was divided in 1945, when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet troops came to facilitate the surrender of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, which had colonized the peninsula for 36 years. The Korean War began June 25, 1950, when North Korean troops poured across the dividing line. Three days later, they occupied the capital of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> forces, led by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops, supported <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, while Chinese troops later sided with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Fighting raged until an armistice was signed on July 27, 1953. At least 2 million military personnel and civilians were killed or wounded. Bitter disputes have continued between the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> since then, with no peace accord and massive military forces in position on both sides of a truce line that has been broken by sporadic clashes. South Korean radical students, a small but vocal political force, have pressed to reunify the two Koreas and demand the removal of 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops stationed in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> under a mutual defense pact. On Friday, Culture-Information Minister <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> <PERSON> Han-mo </PERSON> said the government `` will deal harshly with ideological radicals sympathetic with the principles and cause of the North Korean Communists.'' The radicals also are demanding that <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> serve as a co-host of the Olympic Games scheduled Sept. 17-Oct. 2 in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> In recent years, anti-U.S. sentiment has been growing among <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION>, partly because of a steady campaign by radical students and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demands to open the South Korean market. Despite repeated denials by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, radical students have charged the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with condoning repression and supporting dictatorship in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>.

 President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has agreed to allow <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to return to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> so that the government can try him on charges of stealing billions of dollars, newspapers said Saturday. The <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> Bulletin and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manila </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION> quoted Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s press secretary, <PERSON> Teodoro </PERSON> <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON>, as saying that Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> made the assurance to two Swiss lawyers before she visited <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> earlier this month. The reports did not say when criminal charges against <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s ousted predecessor, will be filed or when Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> will allow him to return. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has refused to allow <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> into the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, citing security reasons. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> lives in exile in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s government has said it will file criminal charges against <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, whom it has accused of stealing up to $ 10 billion in government funds. But the government has not done so because of Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s refusal to let <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> enter the country. Philippine law does not allow trial in absentia. Swiss lawyers are helping the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> government trace money that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his family allegedly placed in Swiss bank accounts. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> has been living in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> since he was toppled by the civilian-military revolt that swept Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to power in February 1986. The Swiss government has frozen the assets of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his associates and has not released information on them to the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> government because of legal challenges posed by <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' lawyers and Swiss banks The unidentified Swiss lawyers said the information will not be turned over `` unless and until there is an assurance that formal charges will be filed against him,'' <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON> was quoted as saying. Swiss law allows the lifting of banking secrecy laws only in case of criminal prosecution. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has said she would allow <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to return now only if he and his family swore allegiance to her government and returned the money he allegedly stole during his 20-year rule. She said later she would abide by any court decision if <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' lawyers in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> raised the matter of his return to the courts <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON> was quoted as saying that Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> `` has to accept the possibility of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> returning home.''

 The bodies of four young Tamil men who had been shot through the head and had their hands tied behind their backs were found in the <LOCATION> Jaffna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, military officials said Saturday. The killings may have stemmed from rivalries among a half-dozen Tamil militant groups, according to the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. The bodies were found Friday in <LOCATION> Urumpirai </LOCATION>, a village five miles north of <LOCATION> Jaffna </LOCATION> and about 185 miles north of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Jaffna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> has been the chief stronghold of Tamil rebels seeking independence or greater autonomy for their ethnic minority. Tamils comprise about 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people. Indian peacekeeping troops have been trying to disarm the rebels for nearly 11 months. Many Tamils say they are discriminated against by island nation's Sinhalese majority, which dominates the government and military. Sinhalese make up 75 percent of the population. The two ethnic groups speak different languages and also are divided by religion. Most Sinhalese are Buddhists and most Tamils are Hindus. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s northern neighbor, has a large Tamil population of its own. It mediated an accord signed last July that was aimed at ending the Tamil war in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>.

 For the first time in 50 years, the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is close to matching the Democrats in numbers, a party adviser said Saturday, as former <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential contenders gathered to rally behind <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, meanwhile, urged <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> Republicans by telephone from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to help him and underscore the `` enormous differences'' he had with Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` The point is, I believe, if we can do that and do it with integrity, the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are going to see the clearest-cut choice in an election since the McGovern-Nixon race in 1972,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I think we need this fall to spell it out without tearing him down personally.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke to the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> Republican State Convention in <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION> through a telephone hookup from the nation's capital. He dismissed recent polls showing him trailing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, blaming his poor showing on getting an early hold on the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination. Since then `` the Republican message disappeared from the political radar screen,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` It just makes me realize just how ridiculous polls are in early June,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` The message is, do n't worry about polls in early June.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeter </PERSON>, a Detroit-based pollster for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign, spoke to a Republican `` Unity'' planning session in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, which attracted <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> delegates from 24 states. He said that while polls still indicate the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> is running slightly behind the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in popularity, `` the fact is, we are doing a better job attracting the younger people.'' Former <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential hopefuls <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, also addressed the session, saying they would be surrogate speakers for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the certain Republican nominee. <PERSON> Teeter </PERSON> credited the baby boom _ people born during the post-World War II expansion period _ for the increased party membership. Since the 1984 election, 52 to 54 percent of the Republican party members have been under age 40, <PERSON> Teeter </PERSON> said. `` For the first time in 50 years, we are going to compare really close with the Democrats, going into this election,'' <PERSON> Teeter </PERSON> said. To win, however, Republicans must attract independents and some Democrats as President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did in the past two elections, he said. `` The tax issue is the best issue we have,'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign manager, of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> attack on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who has endorsed a $ 115 million tax hike for his home state of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, branding <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as `` Tax Hike <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>,'' said `` I've never met a voter yet who wanted his taxes raised. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Donatelli </PERSON>, assistant to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for political and inter-governmental affairs, criticized <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, saying he wanted to return to the `` weak-kneed foreign policy of the past,'' as opposed to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s success with `` foreign policy from strength.'' The former candidates all pledged to work for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` This election may determine the destiny of the nation. This party is destined to govern for the rest of the century,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said that the party needed unity to defeat Democrats. `` We make the speeches, you're going to have to do the work,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. `` Think what it would be like if we lost. You probably would n't want to get out of bed in the morning.'' <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> branded <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as a candidate of dangerous change. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is the only candidate who can address the deficit. He is the candidate of safe change. There is no other solution, and <PERSON> God </PERSON> help us if <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> wins. He is the candidate of radical and dangerous change,'' <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said Saturday it should be up to the people of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> to settle the debate over whether their commonwealth should retain its current status or opt to become a state or for independence. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> platform should support increased autonomy for Puerto Ricans, but that he was n't taking sides in the debate over whether it should no longer be a commonwealth. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, on the third day of his visit to <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, met with religious and political leaders on the island-municipality of <LOCATION> Vieques </LOCATION>, where fishermen and activists have complained for years about <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> shelling practices.

The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> owns two-thirds of <LOCATION> Vieques </LOCATION>. `` When you are empowered you have the right to make such a decision,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` It's up to the judgment of the people.'' He said he looks `` forward to the day when <LOCATION> Vieques </LOCATION> is an island of peace, when there will be peace exercises and not war exercises.'' `` Stop the shelling in <LOCATION> Vieques </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said at an ecumenical peace service. `` We must not destroy the fish. We must not shell-shock the children.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy throughout the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> should focus on economic development, respect for self-determination and thwarting the drug trade, he said. `` The Reagan-Bush policy has been one of invasion -LRB- referring to the 1983 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion of <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> -RRB- and radical disregard for self-determination and for human rights,'' he said. In the late 1970s and early 1980s there were frequents protests in <LOCATION> Vieques </LOCATION> against <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> maneuvers that fishermen said ruined their fishing and hurt tourism and economic development. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> four years ago agreed to reduce the amount of bombing and maneuvers and to spur economic development on <LOCATION> Vieques </LOCATION>. `` All the protests are in the past,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Tapia </PERSON>, who runs the Hotel <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON>.

The official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency accused the Canadian military attache, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON>, of `` engaging in activity that does not correspond to his official status,'' diplomatic jargon for spying. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said a Soviet deputy foreign minister, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Bessmertynkh </PERSON>, told Canadian Ambassador <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> that the <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> government had `` resorted to a new hostile action'' by expelling the senior Soviet military attache and barring other Soviet diplomats from returning. `` Unfortunately, they did n't heed ... our warning that if the Canadian side moved on to further aggravate the situation, it could expect immediate further retaliatory measures,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. In <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, a spokesman for Foreign Minister <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> called the latest <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> move `` totally unwarranted.'' `` This is viewed as a serious escalation in the matter and we ca n't ignore it,'' said the spokesman, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Frazer </PERSON>. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> announced Wednesday that eight Soviets had been expelled and nine others previously assigned to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> were barred from returning. Canadian intelligence sources said the expulsions of Soviets came after the Canadians discovered a Soviet spy ring. The Soviets retaliated the next day, expelling two Canadian diplomats and barring three others from returning. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> then kicked out the senior military attache at the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Embassy </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> and barred a former second secretary from returning. The Kremlin's withdrawal of 25 of its 39 Soviet workers at the <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> will affect daily business in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Frazer </PERSON> said. American diplomats did the cooking, cleaning, driving, translating and errands at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> and at the consulate in <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> after Soviet authorities pulled out all 260 Soviet employees in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Oct. 22, 1986 to retaliate for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> expulsions of Soviet diplomats. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> did not say whether <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> could replace the 25 Soviet workers. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> rejects spying charges leveled against Soviets in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> as `` ungrounded.'' A Soviet deputy foreign minister, <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON>, told a news conference Saturday that the Soviet retaliation was not a deviation from <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> chief <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s `` new thinking'' in foreign affairs. `` I think it's the Canadian leaders who sin by ` old thinking' when they undertake measures which cause surprise,'' <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> said `` It looks like a soap opera to me.'' `` The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is a great power that can not allow anybody to insult it in this way with impunity. That was a totally unprovoked insult and there should be a reaction,'' he said. Canadian intelligence sources said the alleged <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> spy ring was trying to infiltrate an electronics plant in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> where naval weapons systems are built.

 A new campaign to get the Equal Rights Amendment passed wo n't be limited to lobbying <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and state legislatures, leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday. The ERA battle also will be fought at Social Security offices, on college campuses and other places where women are treated unfairly, NOW President <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Yard </PERSON> said during the opening session of the group's national conference. `` We need to invent new tactics to protest inequality,'' <PERSON> Yard </PERSON> told about 500 NOW members. NOW has called on its local chapters to stage sit-ins at Social Security offices to protest unequal distribution of benefits and at college campuses, where women professors have a hard time getting tenure and where predominantly male administrators are insensitive to campus violence against women, she said. `` Our only guarantee against these things is to be included in the Constitution,'' she said. `` We must keep the fire burning and keep those who perpetuate inequality uncomfortable,'' said former NOW president <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Smeal </PERSON>. `` The way we are going to pass this amendment is not to worry about what people think of us.'' The ERA was approved by only 35 of the necessary 38 states before a 10-year time limit expired in 1982. NOW's new campaign for ERA passage officially begins Thursday with a rally in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The group hopes to give <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> a petition with 100,000 signatures. The group's leaders say the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has been hostile to their cause, so the end of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s term makes the time right for passage of the amendment. Recent national polls indicate as much as 75 percent of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> voters support ERA, they said. In addition to more active protesting, NOW will expand its efforts to get women elected to local political offices. <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohan </PERSON>, NOW's political director, said ERA supporters have learned that they need to put ERA sympathizers in power, `` so them is us.'' Fewer than 5 percent of the nation's congressional representatives and only 15 percent of state legislators are women, she noted. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, told NOW members that supporting female candidates is effective even if they do n't win. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said their campaigns focus attention on issues such as pay equity, day care and social services. Former congresswoman and presidential candidate <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Chisholm </PERSON> is scheduled to address the conference Sunday.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s offer of $ 50,000 to the parents of a woman killed when one of its jets slammed into a hotel is an outrage, says a lawyer who is an expert on wrongful death, but the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> says its offer is consistent with state law. <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> law provides little in the way of damage payments when a single person dies, which the woman's family criticized as discriminatory. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harriet </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> already have rejected the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s offer, which doubled the original $ 25,000 sum, and say they may take the matter to court. They had been seeking $ 6.5 million in damages for the death of their daughter, <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>, 30. She was among 10 people killed Oct. 20 when the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> A-7 fighter jet crashed into the lobby of the <LOCATION> Ramada </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Inn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, where she worked. The pilot, who was from <ORGANIZATION> Nellis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, ejected from the craft before it crashed and was not seriously injured. <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chesley </PERSON>, a Cincinnati-based lawyer who specializes in multiple death cases, is not involved in the Goldbergs' case but said the $ 50,000 offer was ridiculous. `` Just because someone is n't married does n't mean their life is n't worth anything,'' he said in a telephone interview Friday. `` There's only one way to get a full settlement: Take it to the courthouse.'' Under <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>'s wrongful death law, a court can award damage payments to parents if a minor child dies, and to the spouse or other financial dependents of an adult who dies. However, only medical, funeral and estate administration costs can be collected when an adult dies who had no financial dependents. Many of the jet crash victims had dependent families, but Ms. <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> was single. `` Based on <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> law, that's an amount that's consistent in this type of situation,'' said Maj. <PERSON> Derence </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fivehouse </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> aviation litigation section. `` If we did somebody harm, we pay them what we owe them by state law. That's my mandate.'' As of Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> had settled 98 of the 108 claims filed, said <PERSON> Fivehouse </PERSON>. He refused to say what size settlements were being offered to families of other victims. `` Only people with dependents are entitled to love and affection? She was such a vital part of our family,'' <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> said of his daughter, the oldest of the couple's three daughters. `` <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> law needs to be changed because our wrongful death law is so archaic,'' <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> said. `` I feel we have a moral obligation to pursue it. Nothing in the way of a settlement is going to bring our daughter back.'' <PERSON> Fivehouse </PERSON> said the Goldbergs were given a July 1 deadline to consider the settlement offer so that the proceedings would not stall. After Friday, the family will be sent a letter acknowledging their rejection of the $ 50,000 offer. The Goldbergs then will have six months to continue negotiations or file suit, <PERSON> Fivehouse </PERSON> said. `` It appears that's what they want,'' he added. <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> said the family would be willing to lower the claim, but plans to file a lawsuit if an agreement is n't reached in the next month. The Goldbergs' $ 6.5 million claim figure was based on the amount of money their daughter would have made during her career, the family's emotional devastation and the cost of psychiatric counseling for Ms. <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>'s survivors. Ms. <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> was a sales representative at the hotel. <PERSON> Chesley </PERSON> has represented families of victims in the 1980 MGM hotel fire in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, that killed 84 people, and the 1977 <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> Supper Club fire in northern <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> that killed 164. Settlements for the claims in the <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION> fire ranged from $ 1 million to $ 2 million for single individuals and $ 7 million to $ 9 million for people with dependents, <PERSON> Chesley </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Iran Admits Retreat from Majnoon, Claims Iraq Used Chemical
Weapons</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said Saturday its forces recaptured two islands in its southern Howeizah marshes, held by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> since 1984, and inflicted the third defeat in nine weeks on its foe in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> Radio, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, claimed the Iraqis used chemical weapons to push enemy troops off the islands, one of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s only footholds on Iraqi soil. The islands are mud and sand mounds linked by causeways and floating bridges. A communique read over <ORGANIZATION> Baghdad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> Majnoon </LOCATION> islands, about 270 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> near the Iranian border, were under Iraqi control by noon after a few hours of fighting. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> admitted that its troops withdrew to `` new defensive positions'' in the face of an assault by `` massive Iraqi forces.'' The Iranians stopped short of conceding the loss of the islands. The wording of the reports was similar to when the Iraqis recaptured the southern <LOCATION> Faw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> on April 18 and drove the Iranians out of their hard-won bridgehead at <LOCATION> Salamcheh </LOCATION>, near the southern city of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>, on May 25. If the Iranians were pushed out of Majnoon, their only hold in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> would be in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s northern <LOCATION> Kurdistan </LOCATION> mountains. But by all accounts, the Iraqis have been active in attacking that area in recent days. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> occupied the <LOCATION> Manjoon </LOCATION> area, part of the 1,000-square-mile Howeizah marshes, in 1984. The Iraqis have about 50 oil wells there, but these were capped early in the nearly 8-year-old war. The official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> warplanes and helicopter gunships flew hundreds of combat missions on Saturday in support of the attack on Majnoon. The agency said the offensive was launched before dawn. It said the air strikes inflicted heavy troop and armor losses while destroying Iranian field headquarters and two anti-aircraft missile batteries. The report quoted military communiques as saying fighter-bombers also hit the <LOCATION> Hamid </LOCATION> military base east of the battle zone and knocked out a bridge in the same area to prevent the Iranians from sending in reinforcements. Iraqi infantry units, supported by tanks, cut an embankment linking the islands with the Iranians reinforcements, which were advancing, the agency reported. The report said <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> troops attacked the islands from the north and south. It said hundreds of Iranian corpses were floating in the marshes as the Iranians retreated. <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said the islands were defended mainly by the Badr Division, a unit of dissident Iraqi Shiite Moslem rebels opposed to the <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> regime and armed by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. But reliable Western military sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Iraqis had 2,000 tanks and 600 artillery pieces for Saturday's offensive. The Iranians, they said, only had about 60 tanks and a handful of artillery guns. <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> Radio said jubilant Iraqis marked the victory by firing a 21-gun salute in the capital and with nationwide celebrations. The Iraqis' aggressive offensives have marked a dramatic switch in strategy _ until April, they have fought the war only from behind their formidable Soviet-style defense lines. An Iraqi diplomatic source in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> by telephone last week that an assault on <PERSON> Majnoon </PERSON> was imminent. `` When we take <LOCATION> Majnoon </LOCATION> we'll have more or less recaptured all the land taken by the Iranians. Then we'll be able to negotiate with them as equals,'' said the diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. The Iraqis have said for two years they were prepared to negotiate an end to the war that neither side appeared capable of winning outright. But <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> has vowed to fight until Iraqi President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, whose army invaded <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in September 1980 after border skirmishes, is toppled.

 Former <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> on Saturday warned of a dangerous step-up in <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> tensions if <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> deploys new surface-to-surface missiles it reportedly is buying from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` I think one of the most worrisome things about the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> for the next three or four years is this rising technology level and particularly missile technology,'' said <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, the ambassador to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from 1977-1985, on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. `` It raises the stakes a great deal and the next time tensions rise _ unless we can get a peace process relaunched _ I think this is a period of some danger in the region.'' Newsweek magazine quoted an unidentified <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration official last week as saying <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> planned to sell <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> its newest M-9 missiles, which have a range of 372 miles. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> can already hit most of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s territory with its Soviet-made Frog-7, SS-1 and SS-21 surface-to-surface missiles that have a range of 37, 160 and 62 miles respectively. But Israeli reports said the M-9 missiles could be placed deeper inside <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> territory, making retaliation more difficult. `` I can certainly understand why the prospect of a sale of a new missile to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> would cause great worries here,'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. `` I'm sure that it will be, if it is not already, a matter of serious discussion between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> ... but how much real effect we would have on Chinese decisions I'm very skeptical.'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s top aide, <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben-Aharon </PERSON>, said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio he had no confirmation that <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> purchased the M-9s. But he said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was deeply concerned about any missiles <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> possesses. `` Now you know the Syrians have missiles of their own from the Russians ... and they have developed a chemical warfare capability,'' <PERSON> Ben-Aharon </PERSON> said. `` In other words, there is a source of threat, very formidable... We are concerned to a very large extent over these developments. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> is visiting the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and is expected to raise the Chinese missile sale issue with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. <PERSON> Ben-Aharon </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s response to the reported sale should be `` military and political and diplomatic.'' `` With regard to the military, we have to exercise, to invest maximum effort in order to develop the kind of countermeasures that would neutralize this threat,'' he said. <PERSON> Ben-Aharon </PERSON> did not elaborate. However, army chief of staff Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON> warned last week that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would respond to the deployment of <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> missiles in various ways, including attacks on missile sites.

<TEXT>
 The state of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> apparently has a claim to five old wooden boats discovered on the bed of the drought-shrunken <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, a lawyer who represents the vessels' four discoverers said Saturday. But if the state does n't claim the boats, which were found last weekend about 100 yards from the river's <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> side, the four <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> men `` would probably have a superior claim over anybody else,'' said attorney <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> <PERSON> Lofton </PERSON>. State Attorney General <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said Saturday that the state would likely pursue clarification of ownership of the boats, which one of the discoverers said may date to the 1840s. `` But it depends on what the value is. It's not their dollar value that's so important, but the historical value,'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said, adding that he was not familiar with the find. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Spears </PERSON> said Saturday that he and three friends found the boats while walking along river bottom that has become exposed and cracked because of the drought that has lowered the river 20 feet. The boats were about a half-mile from the bridge connecting <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, Tenn, <PERSON> Spears </PERSON> said. `` It was a total surprise,'' said <PERSON> Spears </PERSON>, 42, adding that he has long heard tales of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> concealing sunken boats. `` I think this needs to be preserved. It's history.'' The age of the boats has n't been determined, he said. <PERSON> Lofton </PERSON> said his clients also would n't mind `` the possibility of making some money off of it.'' However, the Abandoned Shipwreck Act of 1987, which President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed on April 28, puts boats submerged in navigable waters in possession of the federal government, in trust for the state in which the vessels are found, <PERSON> Lofton </PERSON> said. A state archaeologist who examined the vessels last week did n't seem to think <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> would be interested in preserving them, <PERSON> Lofton </PERSON> said `` That's why I want to read this law,'' <PERSON> Lofton </PERSON> said. If the state decides it does n't want the boats, his clients `` are investigating the possibility of dealing with some sort of salvage company that has the capability of doing this.'' <PERSON> Spears </PERSON> said he and his friends _ <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Suiter </PERSON>, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Samples </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> _ were willing `` to just leave this matter up to time right now,'' to see if the state lays claim to the boats. `` This is very valuable,'' <PERSON> Suiter </PERSON> said. `` We're not out to get somebody to grease our palms. This is something that <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> should be proud of. It could make an archaeological museum that could bring in millions of dollars in tourist traffic.'' The Commercial Appeal at <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> offered a theory Saturday about how the boats sank, quoting two local amateur river historians, <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Marquis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, as saying they may have gone down in a 1918 ice storm. The best-preserved of the five vessels may be a coal barge that dates to the 1880s, the pair said. Columnist <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> also reported that `` veteran river-watchers say the wrecks have been exposed before _ last year, a salvage worker used a torch to cut the metal cleats off one of the boats.'' <PERSON> Suiter </PERSON> discounted the ice storm theory. `` If they had been in this storm, the boats would have been crushed, and they're not,'' he said in a telephone interview.

<HEAD>Watch Tells Moslems When To Pray</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company has designed a wristwatch that alerts Moslems when it's time to pray and even shows them the direction of the holy city of <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> from 120 cities around the world, a newspaper said Saturday. An alarm sounds 10 minutes before each day's five prayer periods, the English-language Saudi Gazette said. The actual time is dictated by the position of the sun, according to the Koran, <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>'s holy book, which also decrees that the faithful should face <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> while praying. Traditionally, the five daily prayer calls are made by muezzins, or priests, who summon the faithful from minarets attached to mosques. Nowadays, prayer periods are published by newspapers and broadcast by radio and television stations in Moslem countries. The watch has been developed by <ORGANIZATION> Sysorex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, a computer systems company based in <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> View </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, the newspaper said. The Gazette quoted <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Saadan </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Sysorex </ORGANIZATION> agent in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, as saying the watch communicates in both Arabic and English and gives both Gregorian and <LOCATION> Hijra </LOCATION>, or Islamic calendar, dates. To overcome differences between Moslem scholars over how prayer times should be determined, <PERSON> Saadan </PERSON> said the times programmed into the watch have been approved by several Islamic bodies. The watch comes in various models ranging in price from $ 85 to $ 115, the newspaper said.

 One day after facing severe criticism from Jewish leaders, Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> on Saturday cited Jews and Christians killed by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> and called the victims' suffering `` a gift to the world.'' The Jewish leaders said they objected to the omission of any specific reference to Jewish suffering in the pontiff's speech during his visit Friday to the former <LOCATION> Mauthausen </LOCATION> death camp. Roman Catholic relations with the Jews have dominated the pontiff's second visit to this Alpine nation, which is observing the 50th anniversary of its annexation by <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in 1938. In <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, 50 protesters disrupted a theater performance of `` The Deputy,'' a play highly critical of the role of Pope <PERSON> Pius </PERSON> <PERSON> XII </PERSON> in dealing with the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>. The protesters said it was improper to stage the play during the pontiff's visit to <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> traveled Saturday to the town of <LOCATION> Lorch </LOCATION>, 25 miles from the Czechoslovak border. `` Not far from here is <LOCATION> Mauthausen </LOCATION>, where Christians, Jews and others were persecuted for many reasons, including their religion,'' he told 80,000 people at a prayer service. `` Their suffering was a gift to the world.'' The pontiff on Friday visited <LOCATION> Mauthausen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s most notorious <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> death camp, where thousands of Jews were among the 110,000 inmates who perished. Late Saturday, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said Mass before 60,000 faithful in the town of <LOCATION> Gork </LOCATION>, about 35 miles from the Yugoslav border, before going to <LOCATION> Salzburg </LOCATION> to spend the night. `` Unfortunately today in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, even in your regions, the ancient roots of faith are threatened in various ways,'' the pontiff said, turning briefly from German to Italian in his homily. He continued: `` Christians must, however, react as a community to this challenge. They must unite even more and stay even closer together.'' As he was leaving the Mass and waving to the crowd, the gold-robed pontiff caught his foot on a walkway and stumbled slightly. An aide rushed up and kept the pope from falling. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s speech at <LOCATION> Mauthausen </LOCATION> prompted immediate criticism. `` The failure of Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> to make any specific reference to the suffering of the Jews while visiting the site of the infamous <LOCATION> Mauthausen </LOCATION> concentration camp is a matter of deep shock to the Jewish community,'' said <PERSON> Elan </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The president of the Austrian Jewish Community, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>, added: `` We had hoped that the pope would evoke in a clear manner the particularly tragic character of the Jewish situation in the context of the Holocaust.'' An estimated 6 million Jews died during Nazi rule. The pontiff cited four concentration camp victims by name, all of them Roman Catholics. <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> told reporters Saturday that the pontiff had no intention of slighting Jews. <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> said the pontiff mentioned the Jews who died at <LOCATION> Mauthausen </LOCATION> during a brief stop at a memorial plaque set up in their memory. On Thursday, the pontiff met with President <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> despite protests from some Jewish leaders. The Austrian president has faced allegations of complicity in Nazi war crimes but denied wrongdoing. The pope spent Friday night in <LOCATION> Salzburg </LOCATION>, a scenic city in northwestern <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. He has been delivering his speeches in German throughout the trip. In <LOCATION> Lorch </LOCATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> cited concerns of workers and farmers in the area. Many of the farmers in the far northern region are having trouble staying in business, often forced to take second jobs to make ends meet. `` The church stands by you when you have social and economic problems,'' the white-robed pontiff said during the outdoor prayer service. The Polish-born pope frequently has called for respect for workers' rights and warned about the potential dangers of unbridled, profit-motivated capitalism. `` These are times when the hour of darkness seems to have descended upon us,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said. `` We hear daily of wars and suppression, deprivation of rights and catastrophes.'' Before he spoke, several local farmers and workers had stood before the pontiff to tell him of the economic difficulties they have been facing. About 85 percent of <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s population of 7.5 million people is Roman Catholic. During the play late Friday night, about 50 protesters stood up during the performance. `` This whole play is a just a lie,'' they shouted. Police intervened and took two of the protesters into custody. <PERSON> Rolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hochhuth </PERSON>'s play alleges that then-Pope <PERSON> Pius </PERSON> <PERSON> XII </PERSON> failed to do enough to prevent the Holocaust.

 The strawberry shortcake was anything but short Saturday as cooking school students put together a 216-foot version of the summertime goodie. `` Rush! Speed! Speed!'' shouted <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, a second-year student at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Culinary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, as teams began building what they hope will be officially recognized as the world's largest strawberry shortcake. First down on the tables were the 31 sheet pans of shortcake cut into 4-inch-wide strips. Next went about 7,200 strawberries, and finally, 18 gallons of whipped cream. `` Step back, I need a picture of this,'' roared <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wobby </PERSON>, the event's organizer, before the whipped cream went on. He also brought the world its longest dish of maple sugar on snow in <LOCATION> Barre </LOCATION> two years ago, a quarter-mile-long affair. As the students put the finishing touches on their cake, the rain picked up, and the crowd lining the sidewalks rushed to the center of State Street for one, or maybe more, of the 2,400 pieces. The largest strawberry shortcake, according to <PERSON> Wobby </PERSON>'s research, was 6 feet in diameter. By square footage, Saturday's long-and-narrow version was considerably larger, <PERSON> Wobby </PERSON> said There is currently no separate entry in the Guinness Book of World Records for largest strawberry shortcake, but the students are hoping to get recognition. `` It's a good gag,'' <PERSON> Wobby </PERSON> said. `` It's something we'll think start thinking about and say, ` That's impossible.' Then, all of a sudden, the blood just turns on, and we find we have the motivation to do it, and we do it.''

 A pet monkey named <PERSON> Bubba </PERSON> who escaped from a basement window and eluded police for three hours finally made a monkey out of everyone when he went home on his own, police said. The 2-foot-long spider monkey apparently escaped Thursday afternoon by tearing through a screen window, said <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Droscoski </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> police spokesman. The mischievous primate proceeded to shred the screens on neighbors' windows, and chased some of the neighborhood children, <PERSON> Droscoski </PERSON> said. When police arrived, <PERSON> Bubba </PERSON> mocked their efforts to capture him by jumping on top of the police car. A police emergency services unit tried to lasso him, but managed only to tree him in his own back yard. After about three hours, <PERSON> Droscoski </PERSON> said, `` he made a monkey out of everybody else. He decided to get back into the house through the same basement window.'' The monkey's owner was not at home at the time.

 A thousand smiling folks said good morning to the nation and posed for a `` family portrait'' on Main Street as a gesture of community spirit aimed at getting a new prison to boost the town's economy. `` It shows they had pride in <LOCATION> Canon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Packard </PERSON>, mayor of the town of some 12,000 people. `` It was hot but I did n't hear a complaint about the heat. Packard and the portrait's organizers said they were pleased with the turnout for the event, which was aimed at creating a sense of community pride. The crowd waved and shouted `` Good Morning, America!'' for photographers, and the high school band played. To wind things up, a banner was unfurled carrying a message to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION>, asking officials to consider <LOCATION> Fremont </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> as a prison `` Communities are out of the habit of doing things like this,'' <PERSON> Packard </PERSON> said. `` We are trying to build up the habit of going down and participating in community events.'' Organizers' next scheme to drum up enthusiasm about downtown Canon City? An `` ugly pickup truck contest.''

<HEAD>Mine-Damaged Frigate Towed Out for Loading Aboard Cargo Ship</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The mine-damaged <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missile frigate <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> was towed out of <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> Saturday toward a <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> island to be loaded aboard a specially built cargo vessel that will take it back to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The 3,600-ton frigate was severely damaged when it hit a submerged Iranian mine April 14. It underwent preliminary repairs at a <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> shipyard and will be rebuilt in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say. The Mighty Servant 2, a 25,743-ton Dutch cargo ship chartered by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> to carry the <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, was anchored off <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> Nu'ayr island, 60 miles west of <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION>. It was to be partially submerged to allow the frigate to be floated onto its deck. The tricky loading operation was in danger of being delayed by rough seas, gulf-based shipping sources reported, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Three-foot swells were reported off <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> Nu'ayr, they said. <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> photographer <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> English </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, which nearly sank after the mine ripped a 25-foot gash in its hull, `` looked normal'' as it was towed from <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION>'s busy port by the tugboat Tornado. He said the frigate was about 12 miles from its rendezvous with the Mighty Servant 2 when the towline was lost, and the frigate continued under its own auxiliary power. Most of the frigate's 225 crewmen have returned to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but 30 stayed behind to go home with the ship. The blast, which wounded 10 crewmen, occurred as the ship tried to back out of what <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said was a newly laid minefield in a main shipping channel 50 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> retaliated four days later with attacks on two Iranian oil platforms, triggering daylong naval clashes in which six Iranian vessels were sunk or damaged. Although <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> Ny'ayr is in an area where Iranian gunboats have attacked commercial shipping, the sources said a 5-mile `` exclusion zone'' was in effect around the island. Another <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> frigate, the <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, was on guard duty in the area, they reported. English said the Italian frigate Espero was also in the area. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> says the <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> will go first to its home port at <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, and then to the Bath, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, shipyard where it was launched two years ago. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials denied reports the ship was judged a `` writeoff'' and will be scrapped. `` The USS <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> is going to Bath Iron Works to be repaired, period,'' said Cmdr. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman at the Pentagon. His comment followed a report in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Guardian daily quoting `` foreign naval sources'' in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> as saying the ship `` has a broken back,'' with only its electronics gear salvageable. The Guardian said the ship was kept in drydock to `` prevent the full extent of damage from being revealed,'' possibly leading to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> conducting a new inquiry into the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> role in the gulf. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, quoted the newwspaper as saying the ship's return home was a cover-up to conceal the loss of the $ 300 million vessel. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said the day the frigate was mined that its back was broken by the blast, which wrecked the engine room, triggering fires and flooding. They later said the ship was saved only by the crew's actions and by its having been at general quarters, with watertight doors closed, when it hit the mine. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials also said the <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> was taken to <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> because it had a shipyard facility capable of handling the preliminary repair work. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has not acknowledged laying the mine. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said several other mines found and destroyed in the area were identical with Iranian mines found earlier in the gulf. They said the latest ones bore no marine growth, indicating they had been in the water only a few days.

All government offices were closed Saturday and it was not possible to learn <PERSON> Morales </PERSON>' whereabouts. The competing Uno mas Uno newspaper quoted a city government statement as saying that the parole was granted after 5 years and 27 days, in agreement with policies that allow release for prisoners who have served two-thirds of their sentence. <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jornada </ORGANIZATION>'s original report on the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> government decision quoted a resolution signed by Foreign Minister <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Sepulveda </PERSON> as saying that <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> was granted asylum on grounds he was a `` political fighter.'' It said the resolution concludes that <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> `` did not arrive at producing harm to society or any individuals in particular, except those he inflicted upon himself.'' A <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman confirmed the report on the resolution. In a phone interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> after the Foreign Ministry's decision was announced, <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> said it was `` a political recognition of our fight'' for independence. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said it was `` disturbed that <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> would consider a convicted felon worthy of the status of a political refugee.''

<TEXT>
 The U.S.-backed rebels on Saturday refused to return to <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> for peace talks with the leftist Sandinista government. A spokesman for the rebels, known as Contras, said the capital does n't have a `` favorable atomosphere'' for negotiations because the government wants to put too many restrictions on rebel negotiators. The Sandinistas had proposed a four-day round of peace talks beginning Sunday in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. As an alternative to another formal round of talks, they offered to meet with the rebels in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to discusss extending the cease-fire. Contra spokesman <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrey </PERSON> said resistance leaders would reply to that offer on Monday. <PERSON> Ferrey </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> that Nicaraguan Resistance leaders complain the government will not let them meet with opposition parties in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> and also wants to restrict Contra negotiators to their hotel. The Sandinistas put similar restrictions on the rebel negotiators during the previous round of talks, which fell apart on June 9. Despite the breakdown, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> said they would maintain a unilateral cease-fire. The Contras agreed to go along. Since then, both sides accused the others of violating the fragile truce. The cease-fire is to expire at the end of the month. The Sandinistas and the Contras began direct, top-level talks on how to end their nearly 7-year-old war in March. The two sides have been unable to agree on key points such as democratic reforms in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and Contra disarmament.

<TEXT>
 Delegates to U.S.-mediated peace talks trying to settle southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> conflicts agreed Saturday to sponsor another round next month in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. A communique at the end of two days of talks said the July 11 meeting will be at the `` experts level'' at an undisclosed place in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It said foreign ministers will not attend. `` Further progress was made, and a plan of work was developed for continuing exchanges at the level of experts to expand on the progress made in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>,'' the communique said. It stated the aim of the negotiations as working `` toward a regional settlement of the conflict in southwestern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' The delegates from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> met Friday and Saturday, seeking a formula to end a 13-year war in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and usher in independence for <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, commonly known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. Earlier talks in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brazzaville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION>, last month failed to achieve settlement. In sessions Saturday morning and afternoon, the delegates dealt with widely divergent proposals presented Friday on how to resolve the war in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and end South African rule in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, conference sources said. About a dozen leaders of the four delegations worked out communique details in a poolside meeting after full negotiations apparently bogged down in the hotel conference room. The venue for the next talks was apparently the main point at issue. The Angola-Cuba side was said to be opposed to holding the next round in an African country like <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. They felt <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> gained too much politically from having its officials appear where they normally are barred because of opposition to apartheid. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, R.F. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, described the morning's talks as `` good, excellent.'' In keeping with a news blackout imposed Friday, all delegates declined to discuss substance. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> told reporters Friday his government was insisting on Cuban troop withdrawal from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> as a prerequisite for Namibian independence. At Friday negotiations, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> demanded <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> set a date for pulling out its more than 50,000 troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, conference sources said. <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> is demanding an end to South African military and logistical support for Angolan rebels of <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>, which has been fighting the Marxist central government in <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION>, also obtains arms from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In 1978, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> revoked <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s League of Nations mandate in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> and called on the <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> government to relinquish the territory.

 Four Arabs stabbed and wounded an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> reserve soldier near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> on Saturday and a bomb exploded near an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> passenger bus as it drove through the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, the military said. No one on the bus was hurt, but the vehicle was damaged, and <PERSON> Jewish </PERSON> settlers threatened to retaliate. Earlier Saturday, troops shot and wounded a Palestinian in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. The army said the soldier was attacked after the Arabs tried to wrest away his weapon as he was hitchhiking near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> at the major <LOCATION> Mesubim </LOCATION> junction. It said he was slightly wounded and was taken to <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hashomer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. The national news agency <ORGANIZATION> Itim </ORGANIZATION> said the soldier, <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Yosef </PERSON>, 38, managed to reach a police station after being stabbed and told police of the attack. <ORGANIZATION> Itim </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Yosef </PERSON> as saying the Arabs stopped their car, got out and demanded his weapon. When he refused, they stabbed him and sped away, <ORGANIZATION> Itim </ORGANIZATION> said. It said police put up roadblocks and detained suspects. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, the driver of an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> bus headed toward the cooperative settlement of <LOCATION> Homesh </LOCATION> heard a loud explosion and an initial investigation showed it was either a roadside bomb or an explosive device thrown at the bus, the army said. The army spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, did n't know how many people were in the bus at the time <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> quoted residents of <LOCATION> Homesh </LOCATION>, 37 miles north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, as saying they planned to block the road linking the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> towns of <LOCATION> Jenin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> and hold a demonstration protesting attacks on Israeli vehicles. On Friday, a <LOCATION> Homesh </LOCATION> man and his wife were slightly injured when Moslem worshipers stoned their car in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. The man opened fire with an Uzi submachine gun and wounded seven Arabs, including two 8-year-old boys. A top aide to Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> could not `` see the light at the end of the tunnel'' and predicted the Arab uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> would continue over an extended period. A Palestinian was slightly wounded in the leg in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> when soldiers opened fire to disperse protesters in the city's casbah, or Arab bazaar, the army said. Officials at <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>' <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ittihad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> identified him as 20-year-old <PERSON> Nahel </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> El-Arbudi </PERSON> and said four other Arabs were treated for tear gas inhalation. In Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, police detained 10 Arabs after scattered stone-throwing incidents, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> reported. Police in riot gear patrolled the streets and stood guard at the entrances to the walled <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Police also were seen stopping Arab vehicles and checking papers. Police closed some streets to traffic. In one incident, youths hurled stones and bottles at a police van from a schoolyard, but there were no injuries. Police searched the school, letting out the students one by one. Police closed three Arab private schools, according to <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> police spokesman <PERSON> Rafi </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>. He said the closures followed stone-throwing attacks. Police have linked the renewed tension in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> to the latest leaflet put out by Palestinian leaders. It called on the Arabs to intensify protests in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and challenge Israeli rule over the city. The leaflet designated Sunday as a day of attacks on Arabs working for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s military administration in the occupied lands. In <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops demolished the second floor of a house, welded shut the doors of eight stores and sealed three side streets in retaliation for a firebomb attack Monday that injured two soldiers, the army said. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>, a protest erupted in the central Manara square after about 200 Moslem fundamentalists met at the nearby mosque, Israeli witnesses said. They said troops fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse protesters. No injuries were reported. Also Saturday, a fire broke out in a forest on the slopes of Mt. <PERSON> Tabor </PERSON> in northern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and about 5,000 trees were destroyed, <ORGANIZATION> Itim </ORGANIZATION> reported. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio quoted police as saying it was arson. Israeli officials have blamed Palestinian nationalists for more than 100 cases of arson since January. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s aide, <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben-Aharon </PERSON>, who spoke on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio on Saturday, predicted the Arab uprising, in which 211 Palestinians and four Israelis have died, would continue. `` We are more than ready to put an end to this entire problem through negotiations and peace,'' he said. `` But for peace, just like dancing, you have to have a partner.''

<TEXT>
 Friends and literary contemporaries of <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerouac </PERSON> reunited Saturday to remember the man who defined the `` beat generation'' of the 1950s. A replay of <PERSON> Kerouac </PERSON>'s reading of the final paragraph of his classic novel `` On the Road'' from a 1959 television show culminated the dedication of a one-acre park commemorating the Lowell-born author. The 90-minute ceremony, attended by about 1,000 people including two of <PERSON> Kerouac </PERSON>'s three wives and poets <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginsberg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferlinghetti </PERSON>, officially opened the first public memorial to <PERSON> Kerouac </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Lowell </LOCATION> and sought to settle past controversy over the project. `` Ultimately, the quality of the work overshadows all the other issues,'' said <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>. `` One of the fundamental principals of the park is to encourage the free exchange of ideas.'' Some residents had opposed the memorial because of <PERSON> Kerouac </PERSON>'s heavy drinking and itinerant, unconventional lifestyle The $ 100,000 memorial is an arrangement of 3-by-8-foot granite panels bearing 15 passages from most of <PERSON> Kerouac </PERSON>'s 20 books and essays, including the so-called <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> novels `` Doctor Sax'' and `` The Town and the City.'' Previously, the only reference to <PERSON> Kerouac </PERSON> was his small grave marker on the other side of the city. `` I feel very good about this memorial,'' said <PERSON> Ginsberg </PERSON>, who met <PERSON> Kerouac </PERSON> when both were students at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in the early 1940s. `` It's so that any kid in the next century can wander in here and be inspired to language and imagination.'' The inscribed panels fit into the park `` as smoothly as the <LOCATION> Merrimack </LOCATION> flows through the city he loved so dearly,'' said <PERSON> Stella </PERSON> <PERSON> Sampas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerouac </PERSON>, who married <PERSON> Kerouac </PERSON> several years before he died of a hemorrhage as a near recluse in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. The dedication was the first meeting between <PERSON> Stella </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerouac </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edith </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, his first wife, since <PERSON> Kerouac </PERSON>'s funeral. `` To me, I see <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> as a friend, lover and a husband,'' said <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, 66, of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. `` I do n't think of him as any different.'' Friday night, <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said she and <PERSON> Ginsberg </PERSON> placed a bottle of cheap wine on <PERSON> Kerouac </PERSON>'s grave. <PERSON> Kerouac </PERSON>'s only child, <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerouac </PERSON>, daughter of his second wife <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Haverty </PERSON>, also attended the opening. `` I have such mixed feelings about him and about the park,'' said <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerouac </PERSON>, 36, who met her father only twice. `` I probably see <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerouac </PERSON> different than most.'' Several dozen people from <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>, the native home of <PERSON> Kerouac </PERSON>'s parents, spoke in French to priests and friends from <PERSON> Kerouac </PERSON>'s boyhood neighborhood, across the <LOCATION> Merrimack </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> from the park, while fans wearing <PERSON> Kerouac </PERSON> T-shirts and carrying copies of his books wandered the Watching the ceremony from a quiet corner was <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Cru </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Kerouac </PERSON>'s best friends and the model for the character <PERSON> Remi </PERSON> <PERSON> Boncoeur </PERSON> in `` On the <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION>.'' `` When <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> and I were sitting around <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> talking of going to sea, we dreamed of a lot of things,'' he said. `` But there was nothing like this.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday said it used high-powered anti-aircraft guns never before seen in the province to shoot a British army helicopter. An <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> statement in <LOCATION> Crossmaglen </LOCATION> said a 12-man unit used two 12.7 mm anti-aircraft guns, three 7.62 mm general purpose machine-guns and rifles Thursday in what it called the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s first successful helicopter The outlawed <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> said the British army Lynx helicopter was hit by armor - piercing and incendiary rounds The Lynx made an emergency landing at <LOCATION> Silverbridge </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armagh </LOCATION> near the border with the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> and the army said several rounds had hit the aircraft.

<HEAD>Cardenas Closes Campaign with Giant Downtown Rally</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 At least 200,000 supporters of opposition presidential candidate <PERSON> Cuauhtemoc </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> filled the downtown Zocalo plaza for a massive closing campaign rally Saturday. Some polls indicate that <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>, candidate of the leftist coalition <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, could finish second to governing party candidate <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> in the July 6 election. Usually the conservative <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> finishes runner-up to the virtually omnipotent <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>, son of the late President <PERSON> Lazaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> and a onetime governor of central <LOCATION> Michoacan </LOCATION> state, broke with the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> last year after his Democratic Current campaign for reform from within was rebuffed. He insists he will win, although the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> never has lost a presidential election or gubernatorial race in any of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s 31 states since its founding in 1929. `` Our victory will be clear and without a shadow of doubt,'' <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> told the packed Zocalo. `` It ca n't be hidden. The possibility of an electoral fraud is in the minds of all Mexicans. We know the evidence of how it is being prepared,'' he said. `` We are struggling for a government of liberties, where we all might be equal before the law and that no limitation whatsoever might be imposed on the exercise of the rights of ideas, writing and publishing, of seeking redress, of transit, of professing religious belief,'' <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> said. `` Ours is a clear, defined plan. It is progressive, democratic, nationalist.'' <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> and his four opponents are traveling throughout <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in the campaign's closing days. Closing rallies are set as late as July 2. <PERSON> Rosario </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibarra </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Piedra </PERSON>, candidate of the tiny <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> called her supporters to the Zocalo on Sunday. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON> of National Action, known as PAN, attracted an estimated 30,000 supporters to a closing rally Friday in <LOCATION> Hermosillo </LOCATION>, capital of northwestern <LOCATION> Sonora </LOCATION> state. He plans to hold his closing Zocalo rally on July 2. The fifth candidate is conservative <PERSON> Gumersindo </PERSON> <PERSON> Magana </PERSON>, of the smallest party competing, the <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>' strong showing prompted an endorsement by <PERSON> Heberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Ballots still will have both candidates, but votes for <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> will be counted as votes for <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>. <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> was a featured speaker at <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>' Zocalo rally. The leftist daily <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jornada </ORGANIZATION> estimated on Saturday that the Zocalo filled to capacity could accommodate 292,297 people. But, according to the survey done by architects and civil engineers, none of them would be able to move. Most estimates of the Zocalo have been that at capacity it could hold as many as 1 million people. Spectators at Saturday's rally said the plaza, bordered by such landmarks as the National Palace and the Metropolitan Cathedral, clearly was filled to capacity and many were standing in surrounding streets. <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jornada </ORGANIZATION>'s study found that a realistic estimate of a filled to capacity rally would be 194,865 people.

 A self-proclaimed electronics surveillance expert was accused Saturday of turning over blank tapes to federal authorities after claiming they would reveal the <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> rape case as a hoax. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> McClease </PERSON>, 26, was ordered held without bail after federal officials charged him with one count each of obstruction of justice and perjury. <PERSON> McClease </PERSON> had publicly claimed Monday that the Rev. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON>, one of the advisers of the black 16-year-old Wappingers Falls girl who said she was raped by six white men last November, had hired him to bug conversations involving her two lawyers, activists <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alton </PERSON> <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. <PERSON> McClease </PERSON> said two of the eight hours he taped showed that the three men, who have advised the girl not to cooperate with a grand jury or investigators, knew Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>'s story was groundless Although hospital tests found no sign of rape after Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> was found last November in a plastic bag, smeared with dog excrement and racial epithets, the case has become a civil rights cause. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> say Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> is the victim of a racist cover-up. `` This is, of course, another unexplained development in a case that has been full of many surprising twists and turns,'' said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Greathead </PERSON>, first assistant state attorney general, at a news conference following McClease's detention hearing. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> continued the hearing until Monday afternoon after Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Federico </PERSON> <PERSON> Virella </PERSON> asked for time to gather witnesses. <PERSON> Virella </PERSON> charged that <PERSON> McClease </PERSON>, 26, of <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, had `` played games with the government'' and was a `` very, very serious risk to flee.'' In a complaint signed by <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> special agent <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, the government charged that <PERSON> McClease </PERSON> turned over two reels of reel-to-reel tape and eight cassette tapes, all of which were blank. The two reels appeared never to have been used, Ms. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. On Saturday, <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> said he was n't surprised that the tapes were blank. `` I think what this does is confirm what we've been saying all along,'' <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> said. `` There's a concerted effort to discredit black leadership in general, me in particular, for the last few months. This man being exposed as a liar shows that.'' According to the government complaint, McClease first appeared before the federal grand jury on Wednesday and refused to produce the tape recordings. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Wohl </PERSON> <PERSON> Kram </PERSON> then ordered him to do so, and gave him a highly limited form of immunity solely for the act of producing the tapes for the grand jury. The complaint said <PERSON> McClease </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> technician, appeared again on Thursday and turned over what he said were original tapes of conversations among the <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> advisers. The tapes were turned over to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> for duplication, the complaint said. `` During the course of duplication, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> audio technicians determined by observing the audio level that all of the original tapes produced by <PERSON> McClease </PERSON> were blank and that in their opinion the two reels looked fresh and never ... used.'' <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> have disavowed knowing <PERSON> McClease </PERSON> and suggested he is a government agent. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said the investigation into <PERSON> McClease </PERSON>'s allegations would continue, but he refused to say whether the government believes any recordings exist from wire-tapping of <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> and <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON>. `` I think it's appropriate at this point to say that any suggestion that the Rev. <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> was involved would be unfair,'' <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> is under investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> for failure to file income taxes and reportedly by a state grand jury for alleged personal use of charitable donations.

 Three more workers died Saturday from burns suffered in a fiery explosion at a gasoline supply depot, bringing to seven the number of confirmed dead in the fire, hospital officials said. The government petroleum monopoly <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the tank farm, confirmed that seven men died and said five were injured. It said the blaze may have started when gasoline `` spilled into an area where soldering work was being done.'' Neighborhoods surrounding the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rafael </LOCATION> sales agency in <LOCATION> Guadalupe </LOCATION> filled up once again as thousands of twice-evacuated residents returned home. Firefighters thought they put out the blazes early Friday and most residents went home, only to flee again in panic a short time later when a tank reignited. The <PERSON> Constructora </PERSON> <PERSON> Quiroga </PERSON> y <PERSON> Villarreal </PERSON> company was doing maintenance work on a fire prevention system Thursday when a 2.2 million-gallon gasoline tank exploded and ignited two other tanks. It was the second major fire at a <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION> gasoline storage depot in a month. Two men died Saturday of burns at the Hospital 21 in <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>, a shift assistant. A third man died Saturday at the city's <LOCATION> Uiversity </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Medellin </PERSON>, an official at the hospital's morgue. Company clerk <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Salas </PERSON> said 13 workers were accounted for after having been reported missing after the blast. A <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION> news release Saturday said the fire was extinguished at 3 a.m. and `` the security of the area has been totally re-established.'' Across from the explosion site, life began returning to normal. Young boys rode bicycles outside the depot's cement walls. Others peeked through gaps in the wall to see the charred remains of the tanks. `` It's good to be home,'' said 28-year-old <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Reymundo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delgado </PERSON>. He said he spent two nights at one of the emergency shelters set up after the disaster. `` The first night I stayed in a cattle stall so I did n't get much sleep. But last night was better,'' he said. One shelter was at the <ORGANIZATION> Guadalupe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exposition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ground </ORGANIZATION>, which houses an annual cattle show and fair. <PERSON> Silvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, 30, who lives across the street from the tanks, said she came home to find milk was sour and meat was spoiled in the refrigerator. `` The electricity was off the whole time and did n't come back on until just after we got home,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> said she was trapped in her house with her mother, sister and nephews for several minutes after the explosion as smoke and fire billowed toward her house. No damage to homes was reported. <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION> said it set up a special blast investigation team. The tank farm was temporarily closed for the investigation. Its 23 tanks supplied gasoline and diesel fuel to area gas stations and other users. Witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they saw the top of one tank rupture outward and then collapse. They said gasoline gushed down the side of the tank and across the ground. The witnesses said they suspected the tank may have ruptured because it was filled far beyond capacity. <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION> has said only there was a gas leak in a tank. <LOCATION> Guadalupe </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Adan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> said in an interview that it was his `` obligation'' to ask the state government to relocate the tank farm because it posed a constant hazard. <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION> closed down a similar tank farm in <LOCATION> Chihuahua </LOCATION>, capital of the northern state of the same name, a month ago following an explosion and daylong fire. No one died in that accident.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, the last major men-only club for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s elite, has followed in the tracks of the <ORGANIZATION> Cosmos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> and voted to accept women as members, its president said Saturday. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D.H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> said the vote by the club's 15-member governing board was taken Wednesday and members were notified by letters that arrived in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> on Saturday. `` We thought it was an idea whose time had come,'' <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> said. `` The board made a policy change to accept ladies in membership for all categories.'' The vote was taken just four days after <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s private <ORGANIZATION> Cosmos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> voted to accept woman and two days after the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> upheld a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> law aimed at requiring the admission of women to big, private clubs where important business dealings often occur. <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> refused to discuss any specifics of the vote or the procedures for acceptance into the exclusive 2,200-member club. He said the club's decision to admit women was not based on the <ORGANIZATION> Cosmos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> precedent or other pressures. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Banzhaf </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, a professor at <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and an opponent of sex discrimination at private clubs, disagreed. `` Once the <ORGANIZATION> Cosmos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> made its decision, it was almost preordained that the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> would have to go the same way,'' <PERSON> Banzhaf </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Banzhaf </PERSON>, who filed a complaint against the <ORGANIZATION> Cosmos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>'s men-only membership policy last year, had taken similar action against the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday based on a <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> ordinance stating that any club with a liquor license may not discriminate in its membership <PERSON> Banzhaf </PERSON> said his next targets under the anti-discrimination law will be three local clubs that admit only women to full membership.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON>, who won praise for recent convictions he obtained against a top Colombian drug czar, plans to resign and run for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, a magazine reported.

<HEAD>Group Acquires Braniff in Buyout; Appoints Former Piedmont
Executives</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A group led by the investment bank <ORGANIZATION> Paine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Webber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday it agreed to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in a leveraged buyout that valued the money-losing airline at $ 111 million. The investor group, <ORGANIZATION> BIA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acquisitions </ORGANIZATION>, also appointed five top executives who resigned from <ORGANIZATION> Piedmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> Friday to manage <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>. `` We intend for <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> to become a strong competitive force in our nation's air travel and hospitality industries,'' <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chodorow </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> BIA </ORGANIZATION> official, said in a statement. <ORGANIZATION> BIA </ORGANIZATION> did not elaborate on its plans for <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> and officials in the investor group could not be reached for comment. But in recent weeks, the group has pledged to expand the Dallas-based airline and protect the jobs of its employees. <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> _ once the country's eighth-largest carrier before it declared bankruptcy in 1982 and laid off thousands of workers _ employs 1,300 people in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and 2,600 total. <ORGANIZATION> BIA </ORGANIZATION> agreed to buy <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> from <ORGANIZATION> Dalfort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which is owned by the <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON> family of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> BIA </ORGANIZATION> is paying $ 7 a share in cash and a pro rata share of 20 percent of the restructured airline for each share of <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> common stock. The agreement capped two weeks of negotiations between <LOCATION> Dalfort </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> BIA </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Dalfort </ORGANIZATION> turned down a previous offer from the investor group about four months ago. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGee </PERSON> will take over as chairman, chief executive and president of <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> McGee </PERSON> was chairman and chief executive of <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> and helped build that airline into the nation's ninth-largest carrier, and one of the most profitable airlines, before it was acquired by <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> last year <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>'s departing vice chairman and chief executive officer <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> was quoted as saying that the company's new board of directors and management would be in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> Monday. `` I believe those who are coming in know the business,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> was quoted as saying in early Sunday editions of the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>. `` If you analyze what <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> is today and what <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> was 10 years ago, you can see very similar airlines.'' The newspaper quoted <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> as saying part of the financing for the buyout would come from the sale of some of the company's assets. <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> posted a net loss of $ 8.1 million in the first quarter of this year. Reports earlier said Fort Worth-based <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> was considering the purchase of $ 40 million of <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>'s assets, including terminal gates at <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> primarily serves the <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>, but analysts have speculated that it may try to reduce its operations at <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, where there is strong competition between Fort Worth-based <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, and expand operations at its second hub at <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> airport, where competition is less severe. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> was quoted as saying he believes the group will keep <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> but expand its <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, hub. <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>'s new board includes <PERSON> Chodorow </PERSON>, a real estate investor who is a principal in the Philadelphia-based investment firm <ORGANIZATION> CoreGroup </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Other new board members include <ORGANIZATION> CoreGroup </ORGANIZATION> principals <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Broker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yogel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> real estate investor <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> and one of his associates, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Terk </PERSON>, attorney <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Tepper </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Steuert </PERSON>, managing director of <PERSON> Paine </PERSON> <PERSON> Webber </PERSON>'s investment banking <PERSON> Paine </PERSON> <PERSON> Webber </PERSON> will control a majority of the airline, the <ORGANIZATION> BIA </ORGANIZATION> statement said. <LOCATION> Dalfort </LOCATION> owned 64 percent of the airline's common stock and all of its Series A preferred stock, which gave it more than 90 percent of the stock voting rights.

<HEAD>Third Baltic Republic Makes Demands For More Autonomy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALISON SMALE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Intellectuals and Communist officials in the Baltic republic of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> have followed two other republics in demanding more autonomy from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> as this week's party conference approaches, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> indicated Saturday. The Communist head of the republic of <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, meanwhile, criticized intellectuals who made radical demands for sovereignty at a stormy meeting of hundreds of writers, artists and scientists this month. A brief report by <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said a rally of about 10,000 people called by a group of intellectuals, The Movement To Support Perestroika, was held in the <LOCATION> Lithuanian </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION> Friday night. Perestroika refers to <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of economic and political reforms. Several intellectuals and delegates to the party conference addressed the crowd, paying `` great attention to the questions of national culture, language, history and ecology,'' and instructing delegates what to say in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The 19th All-Union Conference of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, scheduled to open Tuesday, will be the first since 1941. Five thousand delegates will attend. A similar meeting in the Estonian capital of <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION> June 17 is reported to have attracted 150,000 people, who cheered speeches demanding the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> turn into a federation of sovereign republics. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> did not say if similar demands were raised at the <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION> meeting. But the <ORGANIZATION> Lithuanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, an emigre group in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said it had learned that a Communist official in <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Algirdas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brazauskas </PERSON>, addressed the meeting, calling for a sovereign <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> and for Lithuanian to be made the official language of the republic. The issue of preserving indigenous language and culture in the Baltic republics has evoked strong emotions as a large number of ethnic Russians and other ethnic groups migrate into the area. The Lithuanian Writers' Union demanded April 4 that dual-language schools be abolished in the republic and that Lithuanians outside the republic's borders be taught in Lithuanian. Ethnic Estonians are now in a minority in their own republic, a fact that is fueling concern about the economic, ecological and other consequences of more than 40 years of Soviet rule. The presence of leading Communist party officials at the rally in <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, as in that in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, indicates that demands in both republics for more genuine autonomy from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> have the official backing of the party hierarchy. However, the head of <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Pugo </PERSON>, condemned some unofficial groups he accused of taking their cue from the West. In an interview published Saturday in the daily <ORGANIZATION> Sotsialiticheskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industriya </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, <PERSON> Pugo </PERSON> said: `` We can not close our eyes to the fact that on the background of perestroika and democratization, recidivists of nationalism and chauvinism are appearing.'' `` Some of the so-called ` informal groups' are trying to draw citizens into various actions under speculative, provocative actions written with the help of Western radio stations,'' <PERSON> Pugo </PERSON> said.

Few details of that meeting have been published in the state-run media. A report in the weekly <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> made clear that debates had been stormy. <PERSON> Pugo </PERSON> said that much of the criticism at the intellectuals' meeting `` went ahead without the necessary political analysis. A resolution adopted by the intellectuals and published in <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>'s state-run media June 11 contained a demand to publish the secret protocol of the Soviet-Nazi pact of 1939. The pact ceded the three Baltic republics to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, which sent in troops in 1940.

 Precautions taken by health care workers to protect themselves from the AIDS virus have led to a shortage of the latex and vinyl gloves used in the medical profession. It is difficult to pinpoint the degree of the shortage because manufacturers are reluctant to release production figures and such numbers are not available from industry groups or the government. But there is general agreement that availability has sharply declined in the past year since federal health officials urged health care professionals to take increased care to protect themselves from disease organisms that can be transmitted through body fluids. `` There does seem to be a shortage of gloves in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said Dr. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, which regulates the medical glove industry. `` The glove industry is continuing to gear up the production and marketing of gloves to meet the increased demand.'' The sharp and relatively sudden increase in glove use put a pinch on manufacturers' capacity, said <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Baxter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Deerfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, a major producer of medical gloves. `` The immediate cause was probably the encouragement of the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, urging doctors and dentists to glove up whenever they come in contact with a patient's body fluids,'' <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> said. `` For many health care workers, that was all the motivation they needed to glove up. `` Our demand has doubled in the last two years.'' <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Leebaw </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, said his company's glove manufacturing plant in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, has been operating 24 hours a day for more than a year and is planning to add more production equipment. Also, he said, the company has canceled glove orders from non-medical customers. `` The demand has increased quite a bit in connection with the AIDS problem and the concern in general with disease transmission,'' <PERSON> Leebaw </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> said the shortage is mainly a matter of production capacity, rather than a shortage of the materials needed to make the gloves. Latex, the glove of choice for surgeons, is made from rubber, while vinyl gloves are totally synthetic. <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON> last year constructed a new glove plant in <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> and is planning another facility there, <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> said. The company also has four <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plants and three in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Emory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, said the hospital has felt the shortage, though it has not reached the point where medical service would be threatened. Instead, she said, it has more often been a problem of convenience, with <ORGANIZATION> Emory </ORGANIZATION> personnel sometimes not able to get the type or size of glove they want. `` But we have not had any problems that would have resulted in a slowdown or shutdown in service,'' she said. Because <ORGANIZATION> Emory </ORGANIZATION> is an established hospital, its list of vendors is long and thus the facility has several sources of gloves, Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. But its purchasers have had to work hard to make sure the hospital is adequately stocked. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said gloves should be used whenever an individual might come in contact with a patient's blood, which poses the greatest threat for transmission of the virus that causes AIDS and the hepatitis B virus. Gloves also were advised for protection from numerous other body fluids. <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> said he expects demand for gloves to remain high, though it probably will level off at some point. `` I do n't think we'll get the sudden, sharp increase again,'' <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> said. `` Everyone who needs to know about gloving up knows now.''

 <PERSON> Marta </PERSON> <PERSON> Abba </PERSON>, a leading Italian stage performer of the 1920s and ` 30s and the favorite actress of Sicilian playwright <PERSON> Luigi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pirandello </PERSON>, died on her 88th birthday Friday, her family announced. The family said Saturday that she died at a <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> rest home after suffering a stroke. <PERSON> Abba </PERSON> entered <ORGANIZATION> Milan </ORGANIZATION>'s drama school when she was 15 and began her career in 1923 with the stage company of director <PERSON> Ettore </PERSON> <PERSON> Paladini </PERSON>. She drew acclaim the following year in <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Talli </PERSON>'s production of <PERSON> Chekhov </PERSON>'s `` Gabbiano.'' In 1925, she became the lead actress for <PERSON> Pirandello </PERSON>, who won the 1934 Nobel Prize in literature and is considered a top figure in 20th-century European theater. She also became his lifetime companion. After spending years in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> performing such plays as `` Six Characters in Search of An Author,'' <PERSON> Pirandello </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Abba </ORGANIZATION> went on tour in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and abroad, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pirandello </PERSON> wrote several plays specifically for <ORGANIZATION> Abba </ORGANIZATION>, including `` Come Tu Mi Vuoi'' -LRB- As You Desire Me -RRB- in 1930. In 1928-29, <PERSON> Abba </PERSON> formed her own company of young actors, mostly performing plays of her mentor. In the 1930s, she expanded her repertoire to include <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> and others. <PERSON> Pirandello </PERSON> died in 1936. Two years later, <PERSON> Abba </PERSON> married an American, <PERSON> S.A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Millikin </PERSON>, grandson of a <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> steel baron; retired and settled in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. After the marriage broke up, she moved back to <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> in 1953, returning briefly to the stage with a company in her own name. She had been on the board of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pirandello </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> and Contemporary Italian Theater since 1962. Two years ago, <PERSON> Abba </PERSON> donated to <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> the 560 letters that <PERSON> Pirandello </PERSON> had written her. Funeral services were set for Monday in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Scientists Predict Effects Of Magnetic Storm Will Be Less Intense</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOULDER, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A magnetic storm expected to affect global communications and electric power transmission on Monday may be less intense than originally thought, scientists said Saturday. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> warned Friday about the storm after the largest solar flare in four years exploded from the sun. But <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION> duty forecaster <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Doggett </PERSON> said Saturday he had amended his forecast. `` We had expected the arrival of energetic protons from the flare and they did not arrive yet, which makes me suspect that the amount of energy put out by the flare was not as great as previously expected,'' he said. `` Based on that, I'm not expecting as large of a geomagnetic disturbance.'' Mild proton radiation associated with the solar flare had been expected to reach orbiting spacecraft Saturday. <PERSON> Doggett </PERSON> said the level of flare activity was expected to remain high, but its effects on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> probably would be felt less strongly than initially predicted. For instance, the magnetic storm had been expected to push <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s auroras away from the poles, making the northern lights visible as far south as the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Doggett </PERSON> said Saturday, however, that `` the likelihood of seeing aurora displays wo n't be very high, in the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at least.'' He said disturbances to electrical power transmission also probably will be less than expected. Officials ca n't forecast the magnetic storm with certainty, <PERSON> Doggett </PERSON> said, and the possibility for a strong storm remains as hot gases and electrically charged particles emitted by the solar flare hit Earth's magnetic field. The phenomenon does not directly threaten life on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. However, it can disrupt shortwave and other communications, including contact between airliners and ground controllers and long-distance phone calls. The magnetic storm also could cause errors in the orbits of some satellites.

 <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, the American-Palestinian deported from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> two weeks ago, urged Democrats on Saturday to call in their platform for `` a two-state'' solution in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. That would be `` a great victory,'' <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> said at a luncheon hosted by <PERSON> Margot </PERSON> <PERSON> Kidder </PERSON>, the actress and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> activist, at the hotel where the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Platform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> was meeting. Awad, an advocate of civil disobedience, urged the Democrats to address the Palestinian plight in the party platform. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> deported <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> on June 13 after 40 days in custody and accused him of fomenting unrest on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, a Christian, said he was thinking of converting to <LOCATION> Judiasm </LOCATION> if that is the only way for him to get back into <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and his native <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has sought to have the Democrats support a Palestinian homeland in their platform, but <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the likely nominee, has resisted. The draft platform speaks of `` maintaining the special relationship with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'' while exerting `` new leadership to deliver the promise of peace and security through negotiations that has been held out to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and its neighbors by the Camp David Accords.'' Platform committee member <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Zogby </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> adviser and executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, offered an amendment calling for `` peace based on mutual recognition, territorial compromise and self-determination for Israelis and Palestinians.'' However, the proposal was rejected on a voice vote after Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, speaking for the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> side, said the party should `` not succumb to the temptation ... of wishing to impose on other parties what we think the solution should be'' in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, 44, who took out <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizenship while a student here because of visa problems, said he was not discouraged by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' refusal to accept the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> position <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> said it was `` kind of a political game'' and involves risks that a President <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> could not be expected to take in his first or second year in office. `` I think if at least the platform would say ` two-state solution,' that will be a great victory,'' <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Zogby </PERSON> said nine state Democratic parties adopted platforms endorsing Palestinian self-determination or a homeland. He said they were: <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Zogby </PERSON> noted before the vote that in 1984 a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> amendment on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> drew just 17 votes of support in the platform committee. Saturday's action was by voice vote, but there were clearly far more than 17 in favor of the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> amendment. The luncheon drew Reps. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, D-N.M. and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, as well as <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>, former mayor of <LOCATION> Gary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Anaya </PERSON>, former governor of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Japanese officials announced an agreement Saturday aimed at expanding sales of a range of American-made consumer products in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, a market that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies hve found difficult to penetrate. The agreement would affect American sporting goods and leisure products, furniture, jewelry, processed foods and pet foods, which together accounted for nearly $ 1.6 billion in exports to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> last year. Of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' $ 170 billion trade deficit in 1987, $ 60 billion of the shortfall was with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. American government and business officials have long complained that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> products are not allowed to compete fairly in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` This is a first attempt to really penetrate the Japanese consumer market by getting access to consumers,'' Commerce Secretary <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Verity </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s minister of international trade and industry, <PERSON> Hajime </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamura </PERSON>, announced the pact at a news conference and said they hoped that additional industries would soon be added to the initiative. <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> said that officials from the two countries had discussed the eventual inclusion of about 20 products, including medical and computer equipment. Under the agreement, trade officials from both countries will help American companies locate potential customers in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> said he would soon meet with executives of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industries involved to discuss the program. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> will help remove obstacles that have hindered <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sales in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the officials said. `` <ORGANIZATION> MITI </ORGANIZATION> will work with them in opening opportunities to get the products on the shelves,'' <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> said. `` In department stores, all products are Japanese.'' Japanese banks and trading companies will also try to spur sales of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods. <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Tamura </PERSON> declined to estimate what effect the agreement would have on sales of the American products in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. They acknowledged, however, that the initial results would not be dramatic. `` We do n't have flowers immediately when we try to sow the seeds,'' <PERSON> Tamura </PERSON> said through a translator. `` We have to sow the seeds first.'' <PERSON> Tamura </PERSON> said that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s international trade surplus, which peaked in 1986, has been dropping in recent months while domestic demand has been growing sharply. He said that in the first five months of this year, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imports to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> increased 43 percent over the same period in 1987. `` Now is the best possible opportunity for market entries,'' he said. `` The Japanese consumer is finally coming into his own,'' <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> said. `` For our part, we want the Japanese consumer to be able to buy <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s best.'' <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> exports to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> last year totaled $ 204 million in sporting goods and leisure products, $ 34 million in furniture, $ 217 million in jewelry, and $ 1.1 billion in processed foods and pet food. This is the second trade agreement between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in a week. Last Monday, the two countries reached a trade pact that would result in large increases in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imports of beef and citrus fruits to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> by phasing out or reducing quotas and tariffs.

 State Republican leaders Saturday named conservative foreign policy expert <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keyes </PERSON> as the party's candidate for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat held by Democrat <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarbanes </PERSON>, who is seeking a third term <PERSON> Keyes </PERSON> replaces businessman <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Blair </PERSON>, who won the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination in the March primary but surprised party officials earlier this month when he announced he would withdraw from the race because of unspecified personal and business pressures. The special convention of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> selected <PERSON> Keyes </PERSON> over <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Zarwell </PERSON> by a vote of 106-4. <PERSON> Zarwell </PERSON> had finished well back in a crowded Republican primary this spring. In an acceptance speech, <PERSON> Keyes </PERSON>, 37, pledged a vigorous campaign that would carry a message that `` freedom works.'' In earlier remarks to the convention, <PERSON> Keyes </PERSON> outlined a philosophy that government programs are only effective when they empower individual citizens to solve their own problems. <PERSON> Keyes </PERSON> decried what he said was the emergence in the 1960s of a new liberal philosophy that encourages `` the lie that freedom is a choice with no responsibility.'' <PERSON> Keyes </PERSON>' remarks were well received by the party faithful and seemed, at least for a time, to heal a bitter split in the party. `` Keyes' inspiring vision for <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>'s future, plus his rousing pledge to campaign hard to capture the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat, really fired up the convention,'' said <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> state Chairman <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>. `` With <PERSON> Keyes </PERSON> on the Republican ballot this fall, the Democrats better not take any voters for granted.'' <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> was an earlier backer of <PERSON> Keyes </PERSON> in the days following <PERSON> Blair </PERSON>'s sudden withdrawal announcement. However, other party leaders mounted a last-minute drive to recruit a better known candidate. The effort ended late last week when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON> and a `` mystery'' potential candidate decided not to get in the race. <PERSON> Keyes </PERSON>, a former assistant secretary of <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION>, said he would take an immediate leave of absence from the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, where he is a resident scholar. <PERSON> Keyes </PERSON>, who has a doctorate in government from <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, left the foreign service to serve as an adviser to the presidential campaign of Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N </LOCATION>. Most political observers say <PERSON> Keyes </PERSON> faces a long-odds race to unseat the popular <PERSON> Sarbanes </PERSON>. Following his nomination, <PERSON> Keyes </PERSON> held a news conference in which he supported further aid to the rebels opposing the leftist government of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and funding for the Strategic Defense Initiative, the `` Star Wars'' space shield proposed by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. <PERSON> Keyes </PERSON>, who is black, said he opposed sanctions against the white-ruled government of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the administration's policy of constructive engagement, policies that he said were a choice between `` doing the wrong thing or doing nothing at all. Instead, <PERSON> Keyes </PERSON> argued for `` democratic empowerment.'' He proposed spending $ 100 million to support black institutions in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, such as trade unions and professional associations, to increase the power base of blacks. He criticized the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s decision that legalized abortion, saying that issue should be left to the public to decide.

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Public indifference to the recent military coup in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> will soon wear off and be replaced by renewed agitation for democracy, according to prominent Haitians and diplomatic observers. `` We are living in the shadow of a volcano,'' said one Western diplomat. `` Volcanos sometimes erupt and sometimes they stay dormant for a long time. <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> has been volatile and probably will continue to be volatile.'' Also commenting was the Rev. <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Trieste </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> station <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soleil </ORGANIZATION>, which mobilized opposition to dictator <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> in the months preceding <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON>'s flight to exile in February 1986 `` I have to think we still are on the path to democracy, but that path has taken a strange twist,'' Trieste said. Last Sunday evening, Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> broke out of house arrest, forced his way into the National Palace and expelled President <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON>. He proclaimed himself president, dissolved the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, appointed a military <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> and announced he would rule by decree. Haitians went about their business as if nothing happened. These same Haitians took to the streets by the thousands to demonstrate against <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> when he led the junta that ruled after <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> left, and registered by the hundreds of thousands to vote in last November's aborted elections. An opposition leader, trying to explain the indifference, said most residents of this impoverished, overcrowded <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> nation of 6 million did not feel the change of government directly affected their daily struggles for food and shelter. Also, many Haitians felt <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON>'s presidency was tainted by his acceptance of elections last January that were flawed by low voter turnout, a boycott by more popular candidates and alleged manipulation of the tally by the <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> junta. The political opponent spoke on condition of anonymity. The <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s most influential institution, issued no statement on the coup. Most political and labor leaders who did issue statements chose not to put themselves in open confrontation with the army. But the stage is set for renewed conflict. The 7,000-man army may not be so united as it seemed when leaders from all major units stood behind <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> during a short speech he delivered last Monday on state-run television. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>, the 55-year-old former commander-in-chief, is in poor health and may be a figurehead, said one high-ranking government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. `` They -LRB- officers -RRB- are gorillas,'' the official said. `` They ca n't run a government. They proved that and will prove it again.'' Haitians are not expected to stand by idly while the army restricts freedom of the press, rules by decree rather than by law, and tolerates corruption and human rights abuses as it did during the two years <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> led the junta. Already last week, aides and followers of <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> were arrested and held without charge, and the 1987 constitution was repeatedly violated. <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> provoked his own downfall by siding with Col. <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, commander of the army's second-biggest unit, in a dispute with <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>. He then retired <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> and put him under house arrest. <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> felt the army was his biggest obstacle to reform. He attempted to seize the opportunity of an apparent rift in the ranks to exert civilian control and consolidate his own political power. He almost carried it off. The army appeared to accept <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>'s ouster, and also <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON>'s reorganization of the army in which about three dozen officers _ many of them <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> allies _ were ordered transferred to lesser posts and assignments Ironically, <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> may have been thwarted by a handful of privates and sergeants of the presidential guard. These men, acting out of apparent loyalty to <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>, appeared at the military leader's walled-in compound on the outskirts of the capital with an armored personnel carrier and carried him back to the National Palace.

 Amid flashing sabers and swirling dust, about 380 men on horseback staged a Civil War cavalry skirmish Saturday as part of a three-day reenactment of the Battle of <LOCATION> Gettysburg </LOCATION> on its 125th anniversary. It was the largest Civil War cavalry reenactment ever staged, said <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Holien </PERSON>, a historian with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> of Military History. Previously, no more than 100 horses took part in a mock engagement, he said. `` Cavalry outfits do n't get a chance to show their stuff very often,'' said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Niero </PERSON>, vice president for <ORGANIZATION> Napoleonic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tactics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which organized the event on 700 acres of farmland five miles south of the actual battlefield. `` All you see is soldiers and dust and sabres,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>, a 27-year-old copy machine technician from <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, who took part in the action. <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> rode with the 1st Platoon of the 7th <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cavalry </ORGANIZATION>, a unit he said played Afghani freedom fighters in <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallone </PERSON>'s `` Rambo III.'' Close to 9,000 men in uniform and more than 75,000 spectators were expected for the three days of reenactments ending Sunday with a restaging of <PERSON> Pickett </PERSON>'s charge. Cannons boomed, bugles sounded and pistols crackled as horses charged and withdrew several times in Saturday's portrayal of a cavalry skirmish on the third day of the Battle of <LOCATION> Gettysburg </LOCATION>. At one point, a <ORGANIZATION> Confederate </ORGANIZATION> soldier grabbed the Union flag and headed back toward his line. He was chased by several `` blue coats,'' who retrieved the standard. `` When you go up and grab somebody else's flag, you're asking for trouble. Some of the people get their adrenaline going a little too high and are a little too eager to get into hand-to-hand combat,'' said <PERSON> Holien </PERSON>, who announced the action for a local radio station. One Confederate `` soldier'' who did n't give his name said men in Union uniforms were a little rough with their sabers. At least two riders required hospitalization after falling from their mounts during the fray, authorities said. One suffered a fractured skull and another had a leg injury, said <PERSON> Roseann </PERSON> <PERSON> McGlade </PERSON>, nursing supervisor at <LOCATION> Gettysburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. She said the hospital treated about 24 other reenactors Saturday morning with problems ranging from heat stroke to eye injuries from the dust to stomach pains from eating genuine Civil War food. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> McCutcheon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kennesaw </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, said the danger of riding a horse in a battle reenactment is worth the enjoyment. <PERSON> McCutcheon </PERSON>, another member of the 7th <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, said he has served in the infantry and as an artillery unit. Neither compared to the cavalry, he said. `` The exhilaration of the charge. They're the biggest crowd pleasers. We can ride the wrong way and the crowd will applaud,'' said <PERSON> McCutcheon </PERSON>, a 42-year-old saddle maker and antique dealer. The Battle of <LOCATION> Gettysburg </LOCATION> took place from July 1-3, 1863, and cost a total of close to 50,000 dead and wounded. On July 3, 1863, Confederate General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> ordered Major Gen. J.E.B. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON>'s cavalry to try to break through the Union's line <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> came up against several Union cavalry units including one led by Brig. Gen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Custer </PERSON>, three miles east of <LOCATION> Gettysburg </LOCATION>. A total of 11,000 cavalry soldiers took part in the actual engagement, <PERSON> Holien </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Cuban Production Fell in 1987</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Domestic commercial production in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> fell by 3.2 percent in 1987 because of depreciation of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar, reduced imports and a poor sugar crop, the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> government news agency <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latina </ORGANIZATION> reported Saturday. In monetary terms, mercantile production was $ 491.8 million less than in 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cuba </ORGANIZATION> said in a report cited by the news agency. The dispatch, monitored in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, cited the depreciation of the dollar against other currencies and government restrictions against imports from free-market economies for the decline in the mercantile sector. It also blamed a drought that for the third straight year reduced the sugar harvest, severely affected other crops and lowered cattle production. Sugar production, which <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> <PERSON> Latina </PERSON> called `` the basis of the life of the country,'' fell 3.9 percent last year. The sector's poor performance accounted for 13 percent of the drop in economic production, it said Non-sugar production suffered a 3.1 percent drop in 1987 because of a shortage of foreign reserves needed to purchase supplies from abroad, the bank report said. Imports dropped 20 percent from 1986, it said. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s total foreign trade in 1987 was unchanged from the previous year. The Prensa Latina dispatch did not provide a figure. The country's foreign trade deficit shrank by 1.5 percent, it said. A severe dollar shortage forced the government to ask Western creditor nations this year to reschedule its foreign debt over 15 years and ask for a 5-year grace period, according to a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> document made public in March. The document, released by <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, a conservative human rights group, listed <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s debt to Western creditors at $ 5.5 billion. World oil sales are conducted in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollars. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has been sending proceeds of Soviet oil export sales to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, and so the dollar's decline in value has hit <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s foreign reserves. The decline in mercantile production `` did not affect the quality of life of the population,'' the National bank report said. Life expectancy for men on the island nation was 72.66 years, and 76.1 years for women in 1987, <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latina </ORGANIZATION> said.

<TEXT>
 The foreign ministers from seven leading Latin American nations opened a weekend meeting Saturday aimed at increasing regional economic and trade ties. The Group of Eight _ including <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> _ also will draw up an agenda for a summit meeting of their presidents in the fall at the beach resort of <LOCATION> Punta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Este </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>. Only <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is absent. Its role will be discussed Monday at a continuation of the meeting in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, 300 miles north of <LOCATION> Oaxaca </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> was suspended from the group at its last meeting in February, shortly after military leader Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was indicted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug trafficking charges. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> engineered the ouster of President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> after <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> tried to fire him. A <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> statement confirmed that Foreign Minister <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> will be present at the <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> session, which also will include a review of the Central American situation. The meeting in <LOCATION> Oaxaca </LOCATION>, a picturesque colonial city in southern <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, is intended mostly to explore ways of trying to build a Latin American common market, a project which has been discussed for more than two decades. Recent efforts by <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> indicate a renewed interest in a common market or free trade zone. The three countries last year signed accords breaking down trade barriers and increasing trade among them. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> have shown signs of interest in the idea of reviving Latin American trade partnership, spurred mostly by their huge foreign debts which are making dollars increasingly scarce. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is building a huge pipeline for the Argentine government. `` Integration is one of the issues we will discuss with great confidence and a great sense of realism,'' <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON>, secretary of the Latin American Economic System, told reporters upon his arrival in <LOCATION> Oaxaca </LOCATION> on Friday night. `` We are convinced that the solution to our problems will not come from outside, we have to seek it ourselves.'' His multigovernment regional organization has been doing studies on the project. <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Londono </PERSON>, a representative from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, called the meeting `` very important, because for the first time the directors of the organizations of Latin American integration -LRB- studies -RRB- will be among us.'' <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> formed the Contradora group in 1983 in a so-far unsuccessful effort to find negotiated solutions to the Central American conflicts in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> joined the Contadora group three years ago. They since have become known as the Group of Eight and met in the most extensive presidential summit in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in more than 20 years last November in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> coastal resort of <LOCATION> Acapulco </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Thousands Converge on Site Where Apparition Was Reported</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Tens of thousands of Roman Catholics from many lands converged on <LOCATION> Medjugorje </LOCATION> on Saturday to celebrate the seventh anniversary of a reported apparition of the <ORGANIZATION> Virgin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. <LOCATION> Medjugorje </LOCATION>, a village in central <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, has become a religious shrine since 1981, when six children _ four boys and two irls _ said they saw the <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> while they were tending sheep on nearby hills. Although the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> never formally accepted the <LOCATION> Medjugorje </LOCATION> shrine, the pilgrims, including sick and disabled people, have been gathering each day in the village to watch for the <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> to reappear. They also want to listen to the six Yugoslavs, now adults, communicate with the <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>. About 10 million people from <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> and abroad have visited the site. `` A large number of today's visitors came from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>,'' said the state-operated <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> agency. Communist <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> has a reputation for relative liberalism, but the idea of thousands of Christians turning the village into a religious shrine initially caused great apprehension among authorities. After six years of hesitation, however, state-run companies decided to try to capitalize on the influx of foreign visitors. A modern hotel complex, along with hundreds of private inns, were built to accommodate an unprecedented tourist boom in the region.

 <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>'s governor asked people Saturday to pray for rain to end the drought, <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> officials considered whether to forgo Fourth of July fireworks because of fire danger and barges moved again on the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. Temperatures hissed to record highs, but not in the same places as over the past week. Thanks to a cold front, temperatures across the <LOCATION> northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> were 15 to 25 degrees cooler than Friday, and most of the records were in the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, with relief there expected Sunday. The depleted lower <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> was blocked to shipping again Saturday by barges running aground. Showers and thunderstorms were widespread Friday night and early Saturday across eastern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and southern <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> into the central Gulf coast. `` I ask that God-fearing people across our state put aside time next Wednesday to pray that God will send life-giving rain to our state and our nation,'' <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, a Primitive Baptist lay preacher, said Saturday in his weekly radio address. A few locations in the middle <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> never left the 80s overnight, including <LOCATION> Ottumwa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, at 80 and <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, at 82. High temperature records started falling early. It was n't even noon when the temperature at <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> passed the previous record of 95 and kept on rising to a high of 100. <LOCATION> Flint </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, tied its record of 94 at 10:45 a.m. and continued on to 101. The mercury hit 100 by noon at <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, and reached a record 103, making this June the first there with three 100-plus days since records began in 1873. <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, hit a high of 105 and <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, hit 106, the second highest reading in the country behind 110 at <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz </LOCATION>. The heat wave has been blamed for six deaths. <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> public health officials said people could use air-conditioned public libraries and centers for the aging as cooling shelters Saturday. `` We are monitoring the situation and will open more shelters if needed,'' said Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Marder </PERSON>, a health department official. Fires fanned by hot, dry winds burned at least 1,200 acres in south-central <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, destroying rural homes, chasing campers from state parks and forcing the temporary closure of a 20-mile stretch of Interstate 90-94. Several <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> communities already have decided to do without fireworks this year because of the fire threat, and <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> officials planned to decide by Monday whether to cancel the aerial displays, said parks director <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brigid </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>. One show will go on because the rockets will be shot over <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. `` This is the first time they have been canceled,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, city clerk in <LOCATION> Monroe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, said of the fireworks. `` It's sad. But it would be kind of sad to see your house burn up too.'' A forest fire exacerbated by the heat and lack of rain burned at least 34,000 acres of grass and forest in southeastern <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and a small area of western <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. The blaze burned out of control on its northwest perimeter despite the efforts of 650 firefighters, and <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> officials dropped earlier forecasts that the fire might be contained by Sunday night. A grass and forest fire in northeastern <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> was contained Saturday after burning more than 6,000 acres. Shoshone National Forest officials in northwest <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> said a fire in prime timberland had burned about 550 acres. At <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, a 30-mile-long towboat and barge traffic jam on the dwindling <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> was clearing up Saturday. The river was closed there from Tuesday until a dredge finished clearing a channel on Friday. Southbound barges were cleared during the night before northbound traffic was allowed to start through. However, the increasingly shallow lower <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> was blocked again when barges ran aground near <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Helena </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, and about 20 miles north of <LOCATION> Osceola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Chief Petty Officer Dean <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said Saturday. On Sunday, <ORGANIZATION> Assistant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Secretary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> W. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Page </ORGANIZATION> is to make an aerial inspection of the river `` because we have continued groundings that have blocked traffic,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>. Some shippers are switching to the relatively new Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway that runs from Mobile, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, to the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> which connects to the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Barge traffic on the waterway has increased by 50 percent during the past few days because of low water on the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, a spokesman with the <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> in Mobile, said the Tenn-Tom is `` pretty well drought-proof,'' and has been unaffected by the lack of rain. However, it adds distance and is too narrow to accept the large tows of barges common on the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and has never met original predictions of how much it would be used. More than 5.75 inches of rain was reported overnight at <LOCATION> Leakey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and a flash flood warning was issued in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> for southern Real and northern <LOCATION> Uvalde </LOCATION> counties. Some parts of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> got more than an inch of rain. `` We need an inch of rain every week for the next three or four weeks, just to put the moisture back into the subsoil where it should be,'' said cotton grower <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cheneyville </LOCATION>, La. <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, got its first measurable rain in 30 days and nearby <LOCATION> Childersburg </LOCATION> had torrential rain that beat down cornstalks, covered streets and lawns and overflowed from ditches. A line of intense thunderstorms blew into <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, sent temperatures plummeting and spawned four tornadoes, including one that took the roof off a farm building near <LOCATION> Loveland </LOCATION>. Heavy rain flooded some intersections in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. The heat has been blamed for four deaths in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>.; one in <LOCATION> Thomas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>; and one in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, Ill.

 Some days, <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> works for the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>. Other days, she opposes it. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> and other attorneys at <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s big law firms have been moving back and forth across that fence for two decades. On one side, they butter their bread. On the other, they soothe their souls. The committee, which celebrated its 20th anniversary Saturday, assigns lawyers to represent black, Asian and Hispanic clients in discrimination cases. The lawyers volunteer their time, and 26 <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> law firms donate most of the committee's $ 400,000 annual budget. Those same firms, however, also represent many of the powerful organizations and individuals that the committee sues. To be sure, the lawyers follow ethical guidelines intended to prevent conflicts of interest, and no firm represents both sides in a single case. But the irony of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s top lawyers and law firms donating time and money to take on their establishment clients is obvious _ and the committee's staff is n't shy about discussing it. `` We've been successful by being part of the establishment, but at the same time being an organization that continually challenges the establishment,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnwine </PERSON>, the committee's executive director `` It has its awkward and also its amusing moments,'' said <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, who is simultaneously suing the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> on behalf of the committee and defending the city's <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sewer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> against a suit filed for the committee by another lawyer. A <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> graduate and partner in the firm of <ORGANIZATION> Sullivan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Worcester </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said she likes taking cases for the committee because they are often class-action suits involving `` meaty'' constitutional issues. `` Twenty-five years ago, there was no Civil Rights Act, no Voting Rights Act, no Fair Housing Act, and precious little civil rights,'' Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., told the group at its anniversary dinner Saturday night `` The Lawyers' Committee can point with pride to your indispensable role in the writing of these laws _ and your equally indispensible role in securing their strong enforcement.'' The committee's best-known suit was probably the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> school desegregation case of 1972, which resulted in the court order for racial integration of the city's schools. But the group also has challenged hiring practices in the police and fire departments.

But, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said, most of the city's big law firms also recognize that it is `` in everyone's interest'' to keep <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> `` the most civilized city in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' and that `` part of being civilized is not discriminating on the basis of race.''

<HEAD>Newspaper Probe Finds Elderly Are Victims of Prescription Blunders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two million elderly Americans become ill or die each year because of reactions to drugs often prescribed unnecessarily and sometimes taken in potentially deadly doses, a newspaper reported Sunday. The <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> said it found through a five-month investigation in 13 states that many institutionalized elderly are given mind-altering drugs, that thousands have died after getting wrong dosages and that others were used as guinea pigs in drug experiments. The newspaper said in the first installment of a seven-day series it had found that about one in every seven doses of medicine the elderly receive are in error. Of the $ 9 billion people over 65 spend annually on prescription drugs, about $ 2 billion is considered unnecessary, the Republic said, citing federal records. Officials have estimated the total health-care bill for wrongly medicating the elderly at $ 21 billion a year, the newspaper said. Rep. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Aging, called the problem `` a national outrage. ` Those figures are staggering,'' Pepper said. `` It shows how callous some people are regarding the elderly. All they want to do is placate them until they pass away.'' In <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, some nursing homes have made medication errors more than half the time they give drugs, the Republic said. The national <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> considers a 5 percent error rate acceptable. The newspaper said it also found that: _ Some doctors and drug companies around the country used elderly patients as test subjects for experiments, sometimes involving new, unlicensed drugs, without obtaining the patients' informed consent _ Numerous medical studies conducted since the mid-1970s show the aged have been improperly given tranquilizers, hypnotic drugs and potent antipsychotic drugs that left thousands severely ill, hospitalized or dead. _ Many thousands of elderly who are overmedicated fall, suffering debilitating, sometimes fatal injuries. _ Most medical schools have inadequately trained doctors, particularly in geriatric pharmacology and geriatrics. _ Many doctors do not want to treat the elderly, nor do they find it financially desirable to care for them in nursing homes because of strict federal limitations on Medicare reimbursements. _ Despite congressional orders five years ago to do so, many drug manufacturers still have not tested most of their drugs on the elderly to determine effects and have failed to recognize the need for a category specifying geriatric doses in labeling and package inserts. The Republic also said doctors are ignorant of the extent of medication-related deaths partly because autopsies are rarely performed on the elderly, leaving physicians often to guess the cause. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Goddard </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, who founded the senior citizens segment of the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Luke </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> chemical-dependency unit in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> in 1974, estimated that 30 percent of the patients he met in 10 years directing the program were addicted to prescription medications. Most were women. `` That is the drug problem with older people,'' said <PERSON> Goddard </PERSON>, 84. `` We do n't take heroin or cocaine. It would be a news story if we did.''

 The Democratic Platform Committee rebuffed the <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign on taxes, defense and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> as it approved a succinct, middle-of-the-road platform Saturday tailored to the stands of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. The panel turned aside repeated efforts to amend the platform with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign planks as it approved a document of barely 4,000 words _ one-tenth the size of its 1980 and 1984 platforms. The decisive vote came on the first amendment, when the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> forces sought to append their basic budget plan to the Democratic blueprint. The <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> budget plank was rejected by a 108-44 margin and turned out to be the only issue decided by a standing tally. Later, on voice votes, the Democrats rebuffed the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> forces on attempts to put a call for no-first-use of nuclear weapons in the platform, and on a call for `` self-determination for Israelis and Palestinians.'' The committee did make some changes on issues ranging from child care to the environment, but only when the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaigns were in accord. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>, who chairs the platform committee, praised the final draft as `` a truly unique document. ... I believe we're going to have a victorious year for all Democrats.'' The meeting ended on a note of unity, with the delegates unanimously adding even tougher language to their plank labeling <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> a terrorist state. The final amendment says the next administration will `` determine a date certain by which <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporations leave <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> <PERSON> Norton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s representative on the platform committee, said, `` We feel we have achieved our goal to get <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s views into the platform.'' She said she did not know whether <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would press any floor fights on the platform in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. The meeting lasted 11 hours and, despite the rebuff to the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> forces on key issues, remained harmonious throughout. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' platform chief, said, `` It's a great sign of unity. ... What was demonstrated here is that the Democratic party really has matured and is ready to take the reins of government.'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>, former mayor of <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, offered the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> amendment to freeze the military budget and `` return taxes on the very richest Americans to their 1977 levels and restore corporate taxes to their pre-Reagan levels.'' <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> said raising taxes on those making more than $ 200,000 a year would raise $ 20 billion `` for investment in education, job training and housing for homeless -LRB- and -RRB- other critical domestic needs.'' But Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsui </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> backer, replied, `` I have never believed that the Democratic party's principle and goals and values is to tax Americans. We have never said that was part of our heritage.'' <PERSON> Matsui </PERSON> defended <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s insistence that the government should step up collection of taxes from scofflaws before looking to higher taxes to reduce the deficit. On the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Zogby </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, urged the party to seek `` peace based on mutual recognition, territorial compromise and self-determination for Israelis and Palestinians.'' <PERSON> Zogby </PERSON> said that while Democrats have a commitment to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, `` Palestinians, too, need security. Palestinians want what any other people want: the right to live in peace in their own land, free of occupation.'' But Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, speaking for the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> side, said, `` We should not succumb to the temptation ... of wishing to impose on other parties what we think the solution should be.'' On the no-first-use of nuclear weapons amendment, <PERSON> Claire </PERSON> <PERSON> Greensfelder </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> delegate and anti-nuclear activist from <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, was near tears as she argued, `` Let us remember we are the only people who have ever dropped a nuclear weapon on other people in the world.'' But the delegates rejected the amendment after hearing Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bevill </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> say, `` Certainly this would be weakening a strong defense.'' The Platform Committee also rejected, by voice vote, an attempt to include in the platform the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign's promise to double the federal education budget. The platform does promise to give education `` our highest priority'' and to expand pre-school programs and create a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teacher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> to recruit teachers through scholarships. The 44 <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> votes on the budget plank were nearly a quarter of the <ORGANIZATION> Platform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s full membership of 186, ensuring <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s right to force a fight on the issue on the convention floor in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> next month if he wishes. <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told her by telephone from <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> Friday night that she should press the issues on which they were unable to reach consensus `` in a spirit of collegiality and respect for his opponent, Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.'' She said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> wanted his delegates to remember `` that what counts is the final victory we shall achieve in November.'' <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> told the 153 members at the meeting, `` It's my hope that our work will help elect Democrats from court houses to state houses to the White House.'' Earlier, the governor told reporters, the document was short enough to be put on posters and mailed out, `` read at the convention and posted on the walls of government classes.'' The document, titled `` The Restoration of Competence and <PERSON> Hope </PERSON>,'' pledges that <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> will `` restore competence, caring and incorruptibility to the federal executive branch and get it working again fairly for all Americans.'' As <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> wanted, it terms <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> `` a terrorist state.'' Although it does not mention President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> or Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by name, it derides `` voodoo economics.'' It says Democrats will `` promote peace and prevent war'' but `` not by trading weapons for hostages, not by sending brave Americans to undefined missions in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> ... -LRB- and -RRB- not by toasting a tyrant like -LRB- former <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> as a disciple of democracy.'' It promises the Democrats will seek `` significant reductions'' in nuclear weapons. It urges `` more stable defense budgets'' and `` maintaining the special relationship with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'' while pursuing peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> along lines of the Camp David accords.

 Incumbent Vigdis Finnbogadottir gained an overwhelming victory over another woman candidate in Saturday's presidential election in her bid for a third four-year term Poll officials said early Sunday that with 47.3 percent of the ballot counted, Mrs. <PERSON> Finnbogadottir </PERSON> won about 95 percent of the vote and her rival, <PERSON> Sigrun </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorsteinsdottir </PERSON>, had the remaining 5 percent. The officials said about 75 percent of <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>'s 173,800 eligible voters cast ballots. In conceding defeat in a television interview, Mrs. <PERSON> Thorsteinsdottir </PERSON> said the election had been a great victory for all `` democratic and freedom-loving people in <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>'' as opposed to the `` autocratic and monarchist'' supporters of the establishment. She did not congratulate the 58-year-old president on her victory but offered herself as a presidential aide, saying it was `` obvious that -LRB- the present -RRB- aides are unfit for the job.'' Sources close to the president, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they could hardly envisage a situation where Mrs. <PERSON> Thorsteinsdottir </PERSON>'s advice would be sought. President <PERSON> Finnbogadottir </PERSON> said in a TV interview she was delighted b the results and that any incumbent president would be satisfied with such overwhelming support. Final results were expected later Sunday. Vigdis, as the president is popularly known among the 250,000 Icelanders, was the world's first democratically elected woman state president, when she defeated three men in 1980. She was re-elected unopposed in 1984 and was host at the <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION> superpower summit in October 1986. Mrs. <PERSON> Thorsteinsdottir </PERSON> has been active within the <ORGANIZATION> Humanist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which so far has failed to get a representative elected to the Althing, the world's oldest parliament. Mrs. <PERSON> Thorsteinsdottir </PERSON>, 46, ran on a platform of giving the presidential office a more active role. Mrs. <PERSON> Finnbogadottir </PERSON> maintained that the presidency was created as a ceremonial post and should remain so. The president refused to run an active campaign and repeatedly refused an invitation from her rival to a public debate. Real power in <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION> rests with the prime minister, <PERSON> Thorsteinn </PERSON> <PERSON> Palsson </PERSON>. Saturday was the first time an incumbent president has faced a re-election challenge since <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>, formerly under Danish rule, became a republic in 1944. Icelandic women recently won greater political power. The left-wing Women's Alliance _ which made history in 1983 when it became the first feminist movement in the world to win parliamentary seats _ doubled its representation to six seats in last year's general election. The <ORGANIZATION> Independence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>'s largest political party and a dominant force in the three-party coalition government. Mrs. <PERSON> Finnbogadottir </PERSON>, a divorcee, was formerly director of the <ORGANIZATION> Reykjavik </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>. She had no formal involvement in politics when she was first elected, but was generally regarded as being the preferred candidate of the Icelandic left, notably because of her opposition to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' military presence in <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> base at <LOCATION> Keflavik </LOCATION>. The president is traditionally a non-political figure.

 Angolan rebel leader <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> received an award named for a slain black civil rights leader Saturday but was criticized by anti-apartheid protesters and the civil rights leader's widow. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>, 53, the president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, accepted the Medgar Evers Humanitarian Award from Fayette Mayor <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Evers </PERSON>, brother of the civil rights leader. The award ceremony had to be moved inside city hall from the steps outside to avoid heckling by people protesting <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>'s ties with white-ruled <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, which supports <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>'s struggle against <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s Marxist government and has a policy of racial segregation known as apartheid. `` The Angolan people are not asking for pity, they are asking for understanding because they have proven themselves good fighters. We want freedom in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> said. `` We are going to do it. We need your support. Give us that support.'' `` On behalf of all of us freedom loving people in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Fayette </LOCATION>, whether they like it or not, we feel that you are our hero,'' <PERSON> Evers </PERSON> said in presenting the award. <PERSON> Myrlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Evers </PERSON>, <PERSON> Medgar </PERSON>'s widow, who is remarried and living in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said Thursday that the choice of <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> was politically motivated and that her late husband would not have approved. <PERSON> Medgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Evers </PERSON> was field director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> when he was gunned down in front of his <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> home in 1963. Earlier Saturday, about 40 protesters shouting anti-apartheid and anti-Savimbi epithets gathered outside a <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> motel where <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> had scheduled a news conference. They were met by a Bible-toting, pro-Savimbi group shouting, `` We are against communism.'' <PERSON> Evers </PERSON> failed to calm the protest and eight uniformed <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> police officers forced both groups out of the hotel without incident. `` I hate apartheid because apartheid is the black people being oppressed,'' <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> said during the news conference. He added, however, that he believed `` progress in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> depends on peace in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has refused to withdraw from neighboring <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, in defiance of a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> resolution, because of the presence of <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> that support the government there. `` I am not fighting a South African struggle. I am fighting the struggle for freedom, for dignity of the black people in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Evers </PERSON> compared <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>'s struggle with that of American blacks in the 1960s and said his brother would have approved of the award. `` Dr. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> is a man who has fought for freedom,'' <PERSON> Evers </PERSON> said. `` He fought the Russians, the communists and the Cubans. I've been there. I've seen the work he's done.'' <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> will go to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> next week and meet with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Thursday.

 About 30 women removed their shirts in a city park and bared their breasts for several hours to protest a state law allowing men, but not women, to remove their shirts in public. It was the third year in a row for the protest, which is becoming an annual rite of summer. `` We intend to continue this until the law is changed,'' said <PERSON> Ramona </PERSON> <PERSON> Santorelli </PERSON>, a protest organizer. `` This is a day to celebrate the acceptance of women going shirtless.'' Bare-chested women played softball and volleyball, and lounged in the sun at <LOCATION> Genesee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Santorelli </PERSON> launched the effort three years ago after a security guard ordered her to put a shirt on while she was sunbathing in an uncrowded city park. The first protest in 1986 attracted a large crowd of gawkers and hecklers who taunted the seven women who removed their shirts and were arrested. The women were acquitted of misdemeanor charges, but their victory was a partial one. Judge <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Walz </PERSON> ruled it was permissible for the women to remove their shirts in public as a form of protest, but said it would be illegal for any other reason. Last year, about 25 women bared their breasts and enjoyed their picnic without interruption from onlookers or the police. Saturday was a repeat of that experience. The event was a bit befuddling for <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Massaquoi </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION> attending a family reunion in a picnic shelter near the topless women. `` Looks to me what you have over there is Western society degenerating,'' <PERSON> Massaquoi </PERSON> said. `` In <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, this is the custom and native way and you can understand it.

<HEAD>Dukakis, Jackson Reach Compromise on Rules Changes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> gave in to <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> Saturday on changing Democratic rules for 1992, but the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor stood firm on keeping the party's platform short and non-specific. Meanwhile, Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> savored a victory in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, where his campaign had been sent into a spin by his third-place finish in the caucuses back in February. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, campaigning in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> on Saturday, hailed the proposed rules changes as `` a victory for the people ... a victory for democracy.'' If the rules changes, approved Saturday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> by the party's <ORGANIZATION> Rules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, are adopted by the national convention next month, the number of `` super delegates'' to the 1992 convention would be cut nearly in half. In addition, all states would be compelled to award delegates to presidential candidates in proportion to their support in the primaries and caucuses. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had complained that current provisions for super delegates and the rules in a few state primaries and caucuses unfairly kept him from getting as many delegates as he should have. The rules being changed were the very ones that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had used to his advantage in clinching the Democratic presidential nomination. But <PERSON> Tad </PERSON> <PERSON> Devine </PERSON>, the campaign's director of delegate selection who led the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> negotiating team, said the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor would have won the nomination even if the rules had been changed. The Democrats' Platform Committee, meeting in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, was winding up work on a statement of party principles that <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>, the committee chairman, said would be short enough to print on a poster and mailed out. A 4,000-word draft of the document is one-tenth the size of the 1984 platform. But unlike the Rules Committee, which convened to rubber-stamp the deals worked out in private negotiations between the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaigns, proposals from the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> camp on taxes, defense, the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and other issues were roundly rejected by the Platform Committee. The panel turned aside repeated efforts to amend the platform with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign planks as it approved a document of barely 4,000 words _ one-tenth the size of its 1980 and 1984 platforms. Nevertheless, the mood throughout the 11-hour meeting was harmonious. The first <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> amendment, calling for higher taxes and a freeze on <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending, was defeated 108-44. Later, on voice votes, the Democrats rejected <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign proposals opposing first use of nuclear weapons by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, calling for `` self-determination for Israelis and Palestinians,'' and urging a doubling of the federal education budget. <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> <PERSON> Norton </PERSON>, who heads <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s platform effort, said he told her by telephone that she should press the issues on which they were unable to agree `` in a spirit of collegiality and respect for his opponent, Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.'' One other issue the Democrats need to settle before the convention is the selection of a keynote speaker, and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Treasurer <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> said she is on the short list of candidates being considered by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and party Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>. `` I'm sure the fact that I have been a Democrat all my life and active in the party, and the fact that I am the first female in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to hold public office statewide in 50 years'' played a part, she said. An announcement of who will deliver the convention's keynote address is expected this week. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> spent Saturday in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, where he tried to pry loose some <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> delegates that he said should be his. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> won the state's non-binding primary, but <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> came away with almost all the delegates, who were picked separately. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was taking a breather in his schedule with a weekend on <LOCATION> Nantucket </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. No public events were planned. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke by telephone to state GOP convention delegates in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> Saturday, saying `` the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are going to see the clearest-cut choice in an election since the McGovern-Nixon race in 1972.'' In the February caucuses, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> finished behind <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> recovered from the defeat with a victory in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> primary eight days later. The vice president no longer has any opponents for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nomination, and on Saturday he collected all 37 of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s delegates to the national convention.

<TEXT>
 Turkish officials on Saturday ordered rescue workers to stop digging for survivors of a landslide because of the danger of a new slide. The decision came as West German volunteers said they were `` within a few meters'' -LRB- yards -RRB- of reaching the debris from a crowded coffeehouse engulfed in Thursday's landslide. Up to 100 people were buried in the slide, which also swallowed up a restaurant and an empty high school. `` We are angry. We should have been permitted to go on ... there is a slight chance that people are alive in the coffeehouse basement,'' said <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhl </PERSON>, a deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dog </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Rescue efforts were halted while a new causeway was built to carry off excavated earth. `` There is constant danger of new landslide and of a cave-in and flooding if the West Germans continue. We are engineers, we know the dangers,'' said <PERSON> Erkan </PERSON> <PERSON> Omarbeyoglu </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Trabzon </LOCATION> regional highway director. Three West Germans who were in the coffeehouse were among the missing, along with 43 Turks, according to regional officials. There were reports that two British tourists also were in the coffeehouse, but some witnesses said the two had left before the disaster. `` It is my opinion there's little chance now for finding anyone alive and it lessens every hour,'' said <PERSON> Ruhl </PERSON>. Officials said it could take a month to clear 500,000 tons of earth, rock and uprooted trees blocking the road from the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Trabzon </LOCATION> to eastern <ORGANIZATION> Anatolia </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Geologists were surveying the hillside that collapsed but it was not clear whether they would blast away another chunk that might be dislodged. `` This is a great calamity for our village. We had 10 buses and 300 trucks coming through every day,'' said <PERSON> Riza </PERSON> <PERSON> Yavuz </PERSON>, the village headman. Catak lies 19 miles from <LOCATION> Trabzon </LOCATION> among hazelnut and cherry orchards in the shadow of spectacular mountains. <LOCATION> Trabzon </LOCATION> was famous as Trebizond in medieval times as the capital of a breakaway Byzantine state and later birthplace of the Ottoman Sultan Suleiman Magnificent. Villagers blamed the landslide on what they said was shoddy construction when the highway was widened three years ago to handle increasing truck and tourist traffic. The construction workers blasted the hillside and then failed to shore up a 139-foot-high escarpment, the villagers said. `` I knew it would eventually collapse,'' <PERSON> Yavuz </PERSON> said. He said the villagers appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ankara </LOCATION> just brought `` promises they would deal with the problem eventually.'' The landslide hit the coffeehouse when it was full of bus passengers and truck drivers who had waited all night for bulldozers to clear an earlier rock fall blocking the road. `` It was standing room only in the coffeehouse and people had been watching television there through the night,'' said <PERSON> Nizamettin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozturk </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ozturk </PERSON> said his house was flooded when a fast flowing stream running through the village jammed with rocks and soil and changed course.

 Investigators in the Pentagon bribery probe videotaped meetings in which <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials allegedly took payoffs from consultants, sources close to the two-year investigation said Saturday. The sources said that two key figures in the investigation, <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, deputy assistant secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> for tactical systems, and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON>, a deputy assistant secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, appear on some of the videotapes. However, the sources declined to say whether alleged bribes turned up on the recordings of those two <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials. The consultants shown on the videotapes also include <PERSON> Melvyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>, the former procurement chief for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> whose office was searched on June 7 by federal authorities in the investigation, the sources said. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday night that <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> would leave the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> whenever a defense consultant would call, that his meetings with consultants were recorded and videotaped and that money changed hands. The sources, meanwhile, said that <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON> also was videotaped at meetings with consultants in which highly confidential documents relating to <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> contracts allegedly changed hands. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported that <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, deputy assistant secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> for tactical systems, is among those cooperating in the investigation. Sources close to the case said this past week that <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON> is cooperating in the investigation. Those sources continued to make that assertion Saturday, while other sources and the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said that while <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON> gave a statement to investigators earlier, he is not cooperating with prosecutors at this point. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported in its June 27 editions that <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>, when he was the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s procurement chief under <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON>, initiated a change that effectively eliminated all but one company from a key procurement program in 1986. The change was to drop plans for separate competitions on all six components of the Aegis weapon system and instead go with a winner-take-all scheme. The system protects ships from airborne, surface and underwater missiles. The result of the change, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> quoted several unidentified industry officials as saying, was that hundreds of millions of dollars in <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> contracts for the Aegis system went to <ORGANIZATION> Sperry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, now <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, one of the firms involved in the Pentagon bribery investigation. Defense News quoted sources as attributing the shift that favored <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> to <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>'s close association with <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON>, a consultant to the company. The publication quoted several sources as saying that <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> had boasted about having `` wired'' the Aegis competition in <LOCATION> Sperry </LOCATION>'s favor. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in Sunday's editions that investigators probing <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s involvement in the alleged fraud appeared to be concentrating on the company's contract to build a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> target drone, known as the BQM-74C. The drone is one of two major projects at <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Ventura </LOCATION> division, whose offices in <LOCATION> Newbury </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, were searched earlier this month by <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents as part of the procurement investigation. The Times, citing unidentified sources, said the other <LOCATION> Ventura </LOCATION> project, a missile known as Tacit Rainbow, was not the object of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> search as had previously been reported. In related news, Rep. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Boxer </PERSON> said Saturday that the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, defense contractors and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration `` howled'' about congressional attempts to reform the procurement process, such as a ban on military procurement officials quitting and immediately going to work for the defense industry. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, defense contractors and the administration `` were unabashed in their contempt toward congressional reforms,'' Boxer of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> said in the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> response to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s weekly radio address `` Now, in this terrible scandal, there has apparently been the ultimate contempt _ as many as 50 consultants buying secret information to destroy competition and cheat all of us.'' Inside information allegedly obtained by consultants, including <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>, was in some cases classified and was in other cases proprietary information about specific companies, the government has said in a search warrant for one company involved in the probe, <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell-Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The information was sold to various defense contractors to give the recipients an advantage in competing for contracts worth billions of dollars. About 75 to 100 Pentagon contracts may have been tainted, according to prosecutor <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> <PERSON> Glanzer </PERSON>, declined to comment Saturday about any aspect of the investigation when asked about the videotapes of alleged payoffs to his client and whether his client was cooperating with the government. <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON>' attorney, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Schatzow </PERSON> said Friday night that he had no comment on the videotapes, but added: `` I'll just wait and allow everybody who's been reporting these stories to wait and be embarrassed later.'' <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Barcella </PERSON>, denounced the leaking of information on videotaping. `` This is just a further example of the government trying their case in the press rather than waiting for specific allegations to try in court,'' <PERSON> Barcella </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON> have been temporarily reassigned to non-procurement duties because of the investigation, along with four other <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> employees. The others include <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> official in the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command; <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Berlin </PERSON>, an executive with the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON>, who works in the equipment and service acquisition section of the contracts division, installation and logistics department.

<HEAD>Military Refuses Comment on U.S. Smuggling Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Egyptian military on Saturday refused comment on allegations that two Egyptian army colonels were involved in a plot to export illegally <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> technology for sophisticated missile and other systems. <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> newspapers reported the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> charges in their Sunday editions, but did not mention that two of the suspects were army colonels. The state-run media ignored the story. `` All I have is, no comment,'' <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Col. <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Tohamy </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> by telephone. The <ORGANIZATION> Al-Ahram </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, a frequent conduit for government policy statements, was the only paper with editorial comment on the case. It characterized the suspects as innocent victims swept up in an attempt to damage relations between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wisner </PERSON> said U.S.-Egyptian ties were too vital to be damaged by the affair. `` I think there is a very important relationship between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and problems can be managed,'' <PERSON> Wisner </PERSON> said. The state-run <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> did not report the story for 15 hours after it broke. Its eventual dispatch from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> quoted the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> for its information, but did n't mention the army colonels or a military transport plane the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Justice Department charged was being used to smuggle contraband out of the country. The official <ORGANIZATION> Cairo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> ignored the story all day Saturday, as did Egyptian Television in its evening English, French and Arabic newscasts. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Levi </PERSON> told a news conference in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, Friday night that the two Egyptian officers and three Americans illegally routed sensitive military material to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> without required export licenses. One of the Americans cited is an Egyptian-born rocket expert who allegedly received $ 1 million `` from <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> sources'' for his role, a fact also omitted from Egyptian press reports. Neither of the military men were arrested. <PERSON> Levi </PERSON> said Col. <PERSON> Hussam </PERSON> <PERSON> Yossef </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, and Col. <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdella </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> was detained but released after claiming diplomatic immunity. Egyptian press reports did not name the men but said one worked in the purchasing office of the Egyptian Embassy in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. In its front-page commentary, <ORGANIZATION> Al-Ahram </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announcement of charges was unclear, imprecise and incomplete. `` There is a serious attempt aimed at harming the Egyptian-American relations in the first place,'' <ORGANIZATION> Al-Ahram </ORGANIZATION> said. `` We all know that the American market is open, where people buy and export all strategic items and other things ... Some people may not think of getting prior exporting permission, since the goods could be bought freely.'' The smuggling ring was charged Friday with illegal export and money laundering, and conspiring to ship hundreds of pounds of a substance called carbon-carbon, or carbon composite, to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. The special carbon material, developed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, is used extensively in high-speed aircraft, missiles and rockets because it has a low visibility level to radar and is heat resistant. The carbon is on the federal restricted list, and requires special licenses to be exported. `` It is not the manner of Egyptian institutions to violate the rules, carry out espionage operations or steal secret military documents from the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> or anywhere else,'' <ORGANIZATION> Al-Ahram </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Al-Ahram </ORGANIZATION> denied a plane was flown to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to bring back contraband. `` Many Egyptian planes arrive in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to carry military equipment that <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> gets from <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' the newspaper said. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> receives about $ 1.3 billion a year in military aid from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Five prisoners at the <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correction </ORGANIZATION>, including a convicted murderer, overpowered a guard in the recreation yard to escape Saturday, prison officials said. One inmate was shot as he ran by a guard tower outside the fence and was recaptured immediately, but four others were still at large late Saturday, said <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Marable </PERSON>, a prison spokeswoman. Ms. <PERSON> Marable </PERSON> said the men briefly held a guard hostage about 2:30 p.m. and then cut through a chain-link fence, scaled another fence and a large air conditioning unit before fleeing into nearby woods. The fifth escapee, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, 42, was recaptured when a guard in a tower shot him in the hand during the escape, Ms. <PERSON> Marable </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Marable </PERSON> said those at large Saturday were: <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Edgerton </PERSON>, 21, serving a 20-year sentence for second-degree murder; <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goins </PERSON>, 26, serving 12 years for rape, kidnapping and robbery with a deadly weapon; <PERSON> Irvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, 28, serving 45 years for two counts of assault with intent to murder; and <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, 33, serving 25 years for robbery with a deadly weapon and attempted robbery. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> was serving 15 years and 9 months on robbery charges. `` Shots were fired by two guards as soon as the officers saw them,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Marable </PERSON>. `` We're still not sure if the inmates were all in this together'' or whether they took advantage of a spontaneous opportunity. At least one of the inmates who overpowered the guard was armed with a homemade knife. It was not known Saturday night how they cut the hole through the wire fence. The escape is the largest from the 1,600-inmate medium-security institution since 1979 when 30 men escaped, Ms. <PERSON> Marable </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Report: Boeing Warned Aloha Of Corrosion Problems Prior To Breakup
Incident</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> was warned five months before the in-flight breakup of one of its jets that the airline had 10 planes with significant corrosion problems and needed a new maintenance program, according to a published report. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported in its Sunday editions that the Seattle-based <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> urged <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> to replace corroded fuselage panels on its four most heavily flown jets, including the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 involved in the April 28 accident. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> also urged the airline to take the planes out of service in the spring for permanent repairs, inspections and to complete all deferred maintenance, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said, citing documents that it said are part of the government investigation into the incident in which a section of the plane's roof ripped off during flight. In a Nov. 13 letter, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> advised the airline: `` <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> has a high-frequency flight schedule and operates in a highly corrosive environment. These factors certainly contribute to the corrosion and fatigue damage observed on the two airplanes surveyed. `` This as well as the practice of repainting the airplane before and during inspections, deferring repairs and @ or making temporary instead of terminating -LRB- permanent -RRB- repairs, contributes to our mutual concerns,'' wrote <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>. The manufacturer also urged <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> to develop a new maintenance program that would assure thorough and frequent inspections as well as preventive maintenance on <PERSON> Aloha </PERSON>'s aging planes, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. The recommendations were made after a team of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> engineers visited <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> last fall to collect data for its aging fleet research program, the newspaper said, quoting from a 150-page document. The document consists of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s November maintenance evaluation and dozens of recommendations, as well as listings of the highlights of September, October and January inspections of three older <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> jets. The report also includes material describing <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s findings in the aging fleet survey program. <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said of the documents, `` By their very nature, these documents would be expected to be critical and to recommend changes.'' He told the newspaper that <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s engineers had overlooked many aspects of <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION>'s operations, which led them to draw erroneous conclusions. The document has become part of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s investigation of the accident. The agency's hearing into the cause of the accident will focus not only on <PERSON> Aloha </PERSON>'s maintenance program, but also on <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s responsibility <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> did not share the information with the government until after the accident even though the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> had asked to be apprised of progress on the research at <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> report, the newspaper said, seven of <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION>'s 10 jets were more than 15 years old and three of <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION>'s jets had flown beyond the 75,000 flights originally envisioned as the lifespan of the 737

 An armored car's crew left the keys in the ignition while servicing an automatic teller machine, and returned to find both the van and its cargo of about $ 750,000 missing, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday. Although the van was recovered Friday, about 11 hours after it disappeared, the cash was not, said an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman who spoke on the condition he not be identified. No arrests had been made Saturday, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said. The theft occurred just after 9 a.m. Friday in front of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Building </ORGANIZATION> in downtown <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> and the van was recovered about 8 p.m. in front of a supermarket in neighboring <LOCATION> Anne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arundel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, police said. The driver, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, 29, told police he left the keys in the ignition, according to company policy, and closed his door. With the keys in the ignition, the doors of the van are supposed to lock automatically.

<TEXT>
 A security guard accused of shooting up the warehouse where he worked mumbled complaints about his job as he fired on co-workers, killing two and wounding four, police and witnesses said. <PERSON> Sebron </PERSON> <PERSON> Flenaugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 45, was arrested without incident at his home by <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> police Friday night about three hours after the rampage at the <ORGANIZATION> Micropure </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> warehouse. The company distributes household water purifying kits. Witnesses told police that a man dressed in a guard's uniform and brandishing a handgun had followed an employee through a door and into the warehouse, where he started shooting on the shipping dock. There were 21 telemarketing people working in the building at the time. The gunman used .357 - caliber revolver carrying six rounds, <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION> police `` I was sitting at the break table,'' said <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Patton </PERSON>, 19, `` and he just walked in and started shooting my friends. I ran and called police.'' ` Everybody was screaming and running,'' said 17-year-old <PERSON> Germaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON>, who was in the shipping room when the shooting started. `` I hit the ground and went under the table.'' Throughout the shootings, workers said the gunman uttered barely audible curses, several times complaining of either a `` lousy job'' or a `` crummy job.'' After the shootings the guard went out the back door, got into his car and drove away, witnesses told police. Seventeen-year-old <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollis </PERSON> of <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, who was hit in the chest and abdomen, died Friday night on the operating table at <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Muir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Walnut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Disney </PERSON>, 19, of <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION> died about five hours later at the hospital after surgery on stomach wounds. <PERSON> Flenaugh </PERSON>, who was not authorized to carry a weapon on the job, was an employee of <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Danville </LOCATION>, which had assigned him to the Micropure warehouse, said <ORGANIZATION> Concord </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>. Micropure worker <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said <PERSON> Flenaugh </PERSON> `` always carried a gun'' while he was working. <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said the guard did not conceal the weapon. Micropure employees said <PERSON> Flenaugh </PERSON> had worked at the company about 18 months and was a loner. Police Lt. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> on Saturday said <PERSON> Flenaugh </PERSON> had a `` casual but congenial'' relationship with the victims. <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> added that `` indications at this point are that he aimed at these specific people. Why? ... I do n't know.'' <PERSON> Flenaugh </PERSON> had n't provided police with any motive, <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> said. `` Possibly he was depressed, but we're not sure what set him off,'' he said. He said <PERSON> Flenaugh </PERSON> would be booked for investigation of murder and five counts of assault with a deadly weapon. Micropure workers described <PERSON> Flenaugh </PERSON> as `` friendly'' in the past, and said they liked him enough to ask him to join them for beer and pizza. He always declined, however, they said. One of the injured was taken to <PERSON> Muir </PERSON> with a superficial back wound. The other three victims were taken to <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diablo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION>, where all were reported in stable condition Saturday. Micropure employs about 45 people in the one-story building where the shootings occurred.

<HEAD>Veterans Waiting Days For Tickets Home</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Soviet soldiers returning from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> are forced to wait days and pay black market prices to get home as the summer vacation rush pushes the country's transport system to its limits, it was reported Friday. Two reporters of the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> recounted trips around railway stations in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and airports in different regions where Afghan veterans were standing in long lines to get home. One group waited three days at a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> station trying to get to <LOCATION> Simferopol </LOCATION>, the main town in the <LOCATION> Crimea </LOCATION>, one of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s prime vacation regions, <ORGANIZATION> TASS </ORGANIZATION> said The reporters quoted the group as saying cashiers in the <LOCATION> Uzbek </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Tashkent </LOCATION>, where many soldiers land on their way home from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, were asking for the equivalent of $ 170 or demanding foreign currency coupons to sell airplane tickets to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Some veterans then have to wait in the capital penniless, leaving only once they are sent money from home, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. A soldier identified only as <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Pavlov </PERSON> told the reporters he was lucky enough to have a commander who made return reservations in advance for his unit. But he complained bitterly about a three-hour wait in 113-degree heat at the <LOCATION> Tashkent </LOCATION> airport to clear customs. `` I'll admit, we expected some other kind of welcome,'' <PERSON> Pavlov </PERSON> was quoted as saying. The <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> report quoted a senior <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official as saying the situation had improved in recent days. The official said the army was doing everything it could to clear the backlog at railway stations and airports. The jam is worsened by regular soldiers returning home on summer leave and conscripts finishing their two-year compulsory military service, the official was quoted as saying. Domestic flights on the state-run Soviet airline, <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION>, are almost always sold out, even in winter. In summer, trains to the south where many of the country's 284 million people take vacation are jammed full. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is estimated to have had about 115,000 troops in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Under an accord negotiated in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, Soviet troops began pulling out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> May 15. Half the force is scheduled to be back home by the end of August, with the withdrawal completed by next Feb. 15.

<HEAD>Joint European Gulf Minesweeping Task Force Formed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 British, <LOCATION> Dutch </LOCATION> and Belgian ships will form a joint minesweeping task force to keep the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> clear for merchant vessels, the British government announced Friday. The flotilla is the first joint European task force in the region since the Iran-Iraq war began in September 1980. It will not increase the number of mine sweepers the three nations already have in the gulf. <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, armed forces minister of state, notified <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in a written message Friday that five minesweepers already in the gulf _ three British, one Dutch, one Belgian _ will begin joint operations July 1. Their movements will be controlled by a separate British vessel under command of a <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officer, a <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. The commander will be assisted by a Belgian or Dutch staff officer. `` The arrangements for cooperation between the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and other Western navies in the gulf remain unchanged,'' <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said. Naval units from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> also patrol the region, offering protection to their own flag merchant vessels. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> recently broadened its role to allow its warships to intervene in attacks on neutral shipping. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> attacks neutral vessels in retaliation for <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> raids on its own shipping lanes. The Iranians have also been accused of sowing mines. The Western navies have co-ordinated their efforts in recent years to keep the strategic waterway open, but have retained separate commands. Last month, <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said Soviet proposals to form a single U.N.-sponsored task force in the gulf `` would be very difficult to put together ... in practical terms.'' The British, Dutch and Belgian governments have been engaged in discussions `` for some time'' about bringing their minesweepers under joint control, the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said, speaking on condition of anonymity in keeping with British practice. The planned withdrawal of a Belgian command vessel from the area July 1 `` strengthened the case for full co-operation,'' the spokesman said. The new task force will patrol the area north of <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, the spokesman said, under the protection of a destroyer and two frigates from the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s Armilla patrol. The operation is code-named `` Calendar'' after the successful mine clearance of the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>' Scheldt estuary after World War II. A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Jane </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which produces the authoritative `` <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s Fighting Ships,'' said vessels from the Western navies in the region currently number 52. There are 27 American vessels in the gulf and north <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>, the U.S.-backed leader of a guerrilla war against <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s Cuban-supported government, on Friday defended taking help from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` When you are fighting for your country, you must get help from even the devil himself,'' said <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, also known as <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> spoke here before a group of anti-communist Cuban exiles as peace talks continued to end the 13-year civil war. Democratic presidential contender <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and American black leaders have denounced <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> for taking arms from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, but he says he is misunderstood. `` I condemn apartheid, but I support freedom,'' <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> told a news conference. `` I'm not here to discuss the policies of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, which I condemn. I'm fighting for freedom and you must do it any way you can.'' <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> said the current buildup of 57,000 Cuban troops in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> clouds the peace talks that began this week in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, the third round of discussions in two months. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which also helps arm the Angolan guerrillas, is mediating between <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and a joint Angolan-Cuban delegation to resolve the war and end South African rule over neighboring <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s Marxist government is demanding an end to South African military aid to the <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> rebels, while <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is is demanding that <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> withdraw its troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> as a precondition for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s independence. `` There were 45,000 Cuban troops in March, and now there are 57,000,'' <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> said. `` They're not withdrawing, they're increasing tremendously `` We do n't want to be recolonized by <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>, who once fought to help free <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> from colonization by <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>'s one-day visit to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> was sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Cuban-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 Three peace groups planned an all-night prayer vigil as about 250 <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops gathered Friday for a national conference to consider AIDS, women's issues and the morality of nuclear war. On Saturday the bishops are to debate and vote on a report about the morality of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear policy. <PERSON> Pax </PERSON> <PERSON> Christi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Benedictines </ORGANIZATION> for Peace from <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joseph </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Collegeville </LOCATION>, and Franciscans for Peace of Little Falls planned the vigil to coincide with discussions on the morality of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear policy. The report on nuclear policy is the result of two years of work by a bishops' committee commissioned as a follow-up to their 1983 peace pastoral. The committee is recommending that its `` conditional acceptance'' of nuclear deterrence be retained, according to a pre-conference news release. The bishops received a letter Friday from Gen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrahamson </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, who wrote of his fears that some of conference's recommendations might be based on inaccurate information. `` Specifically, I wish to challenge some of the arguments which attempt to substantiate the final recommendations ... which, if left unchallenged, will certainly perpetuate the cloud of misunderstanding that surrounds SDI and its promise of a moral deterrence to nuclear war,'' he said. The session at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in south-central <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> is the fourth meeting in six years of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION>. About 280 of the bishops also discussed Friday the first draft of a pastoral letter on the concerns of women in church and society. `` It is one thing to read a report on the reactions of women to the first draft of this pastoral,'' the Most Rev. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Imesch </PERSON> told the conference. `` It is quite another thing to hear women voice their concerns personally. `` The mere fact that men were writing a pastoral letter about women caused considerable skepticism for a number of people,'' said <PERSON> Imesch </PERSON>, bishop of the <LOCATION> Joliet </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, diocese. `` We dared not presume what women thought or felt.'' The 100-page document is the result of three years work by a committee of six bishops and seven women. The committee met with 25 national <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> women's oganizations and heard from 75,000 women who participated in forums in 100 dioceses, and at 60 colleges and 45 military bases across the country. The document also explores <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> tradition and proposes ways of addressing the concerns within the framework of the teachings of the church. A majority of women love the church, the report said. Many are comfortable with their treatment in the church, but many others want more participation. Some saw their exclusion from the priesthood as unjust. The document does n't address the issue of the ordination of women to the priestood, but it calls for a study of allowing women to become deacons. The majority praised the church's stance on abortion, but many questioned its teaching on contraception. The document, which calls sexism a sin, also insists that men take their responsibility in the areas of sexuality, procreation and parenthood seriously. After hearing the concerns of other bishops, <PERSON> Imesch </PERSON> said the document might need a major revision but he still hoped the bishops could act upon it as scheduled for their November 1989 meeting.

<HEAD>Parched Farmland and Withering Crops Spawn Search For `Drought
Stocks'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After viewing the drought as a reason to shun stocks, some strategists see it as a chance to buy into companies that could profit by selling products ranging from hybrid seeds to well-drilling rigs. Food processors, fertilizer makers, seed distributors, farm equipment manufacturers and irrigation companies are getting increased scrutiny as possible investment opportunities because of the drought, which has withered much of this year's crops and sent corn, wheat and soybean prices soaring. The thinking is that farmers will have to invest heavily for the 1989 harvest and that food companies will enjoy better profits from higher prices. For example, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, one of the largest hybrid seed-corn producers, has attracted some attention as a possible beneficiary, partly because of its advanced research into drought-resistant strains. `` These people have been through this before, and are exceedingly familiar with drought conditions,'' said <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON>, a stock strategist at the <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, office of the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Newhard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` They are by far the superior company in this business.'' Freight-hauling companies, especially railroads and truckers, also appear well-positioned to exploit the barge backups on the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, which have drastically reduced the amount of grain shipped to food processors. `` Certainly the transportation aspect of the agriculture market is going to be a winner here, because most farmers are going to be very quick to get their product to market,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbanel </PERSON>, a futures expert at <ORGANIZATION> Gruntal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` If somebody has a better system for transporting grains, it's certainly a moneymaking situation.'' A projected shortage of soybeans also has some Wall Street analysts puzzling out the profitable opportunities. Soybeans are getting heavy attention because they are used in a wide range of products unrelated to food, from unleaded gasoline to cosmetics. A few strategists are even recommending poultry companies. Their argument goes like this: Cattle farmers will be forced to slaughter their herds this year because they ca n't afford to feed them. This will create a short-term beef and pork glut, but by next year acute shortages are certain. With meat prices soaring then, more consumers may switch to cheaper chicken. Others are focusing on large fast-food chains that will likely benefit from higher food prices. <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, for example, has been touted by some brokers recently, because it is expected to get increased royalties linked to higher sales revenue from its franchised restaurants. Wall Street initially seized on the drought as a sell signal because it implies sharply higher inflation, which theoretically raises pressure on the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to hike interest rates and thus erodes the comparative value of stocks. But as other evidence has emerged that inflation remains tame, the drought theme has been transformed into an obscure form of good news in the stock market. Some investment strategists see it as the vehicle for companies to lock in greater profit margins by raising prices now. `` In classic supply-demand fashion, commodity prices could fall next year,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bierbusse </PERSON>, an analyst who follows cereal companies for the investment firm of <ORGANIZATION> A.G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Sons in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. `` But you and I both know that cereal prices do n't go down.'' Others, however, have n't flocked to the drought theme. They say the drought could hurt food companies, especially those lacking long-term commitments to buy grain at pre-drought prices. They also say the disaster could ruin fragile rural economies and will clearly spill into other areas. `` There's going to be some impact,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiritilli </PERSON>, vice president and director of research at <ORGANIZATION> Rodman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Renshaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` Retailers and banks could get hurt. A farmer who does n't have crops ca n't pay loans back. Whatever the ultimate outcome of the drought on Wall Street's collective thinking, some believe it will be short-lived, soon to be displaced by another significant economic event `` The attention span on Wall Street is about 30 minutes,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sobel </PERSON>, a market historian and author. `` If it rains tomorrow, they'll forget about it completely.''

<HEAD>Child Labor Again a Problem in China</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Child labor, widespread in old <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, is on the rise again and is worrying Communist authorities. The official media report the problem is most severe in the countryside, where the government's new economic reforms encourage private farming and small rural factories. Young children, mostly girls, often are taken out of school to work on farms or factories to add to family incomes. Another reason cited is a lack of funds for rural education. When they took over <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1949, the Communists sought to eliminate child labor and raise literacy rates. They claim to have lowered illiteracy rates from 80 percent when they took over to 20 percent now. The seriousness with which child labor now is viewed is indicated in a series of recent articles in the official press. The weekly Liaowang -LRB- Outlook -RRB-, for example, recently published a pictorial essay featuring a 12-year-old girl from the countryside, <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhangrong </PERSON>, who dropped out of school to work 12 hours a day in a privately run paper-dye factory. She was shown in photographs carrying a bucket of what was described as noxious, smelly dye on her first day of work. <PERSON> Liaowang </PERSON> and other Chinese reports have expressed alarm at the trend. `` An increasing number of children from rural <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> are missing out on the opportunity to go to school, and the situation is getting worse,'' the official newspaper <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> said. Chinese laws state that children under 16 should not work at all. A 1986 law calls for nine years of education, but the government acknowledges this wo n't be possible until the year 2000 because of a lack of facilities. Ironically, the education laws are being ignored in part because of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s much-praised economic reforms. `` The development of the commodity economy has left a deep mark on the hearts of children,'' <PERSON> Liaowang </PERSON> said. `` It is a popular slogan in coastal areas that primary school pupils make big money while college students make little money.'' A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> survey recently found that only 71 percent of school-age children were attending classes in southern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Guangdong </LOCATION> province, the nation's most advanced in adapting a market-based economy. The People's Daily, which is the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, reported the inland province of <LOCATION> Hubei </LOCATION> had 1.5 million dropouts last year. The province had about 9 million primary and middle school students in 1985. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> says 96 percent of Chinese children complete the six grades of primary school, but only about two-thirds go on to three-year junior middle school, which is theoretically compulsory. A heavy proportion of the dropouts are girls, who traditionally have received little education in rural <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and are now in demand to work in the thousands of small textile and light industry plants springing up in the countryside. The official Guangming Daily, blaming `` wrong parental attitudes'' for the dropout problem, said an investigation of four construction teams in <LOCATION> Jiangxi </LOCATION> province, southern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, found that nearly a quarter of the workers were children. In <LOCATION> Hebei </LOCATION> province to the north, it added, a third of the peddlers in one village market were junior middle school dropouts. `` My mother told me to quit,'' one 12-year-old candy seller was quoted as saying. It quoted the mother as saying she thought school fees were a waste of money since the boy had little chance of getting a higher education. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has only about 2 million university students, compared to 180 million primary and middle school students out of a population of 1 billion. Although <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> spends a respectable 3 percent of gross national product on education, 20 percent of that goes to higher education. Primary schools, particularly in rural areas, face financial problems that have discouraged school attendance. One report from coastal <LOCATION> Fujian </LOCATION> province said 148 rural schools in one region had been closed and 2,800 pupils had no place to go to school because so many teachers, among the lowest-paid workers in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, had resigned to take other jobs. The Fujian Daily quoted <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Quanbao </PERSON> as saying he quit his teaching job, which paid 33.5 yuan -LRB- $ 9 -RRB- a month, to make as much in three days selling tea leaves as he did in a semester of teaching. Although schooling is supposed to be free, financially strapped schools have slapped on various maintenance fees. Some poor families say these have forced them to withdraw their children.

<HEAD>Heat Wave Coping</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The stifling heat baking much of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> threatens more than crops, weather experts warn. Heat kills people too. The 1980 heat wave claimed the lives of an estimated 1,265 Americans, according to an analysis prepared for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. Many of the victims were elderly and poor, living in homes or apartments that lacked air Hot weather places greater stress on the heart and blood vessels, warns the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. Thus, when temperatures rise, so do the number of heart attacks and strokes. And high humidity just makes it worse, by interfering with the body's ability to cool itself. The human body is cooled by evaporation of sweat and by circulating blood closer to the skin to allow the heat to dissipate. The problem is that when the air temperature gets close to the body's 98.6 degree Fahrenheit normal, heat does n't dissipate outward as readily. Sweating does nothing to cool the body unless the moisture is removed by evaporation into the air, and humid air is n't as willing to accept that liquid as is dry air. As the body tries to cope with increasing heat it begins pumping a torrent of blood through the dilated circulatory system, while the sweat glands pour out liquid, including dissolved chemicals that the body may need. What follows can be a heat-related illness when the body can no longer shed enough heat to keep its temperature near normal levels, or when it can not cope with loss of liquid and chemicals. These illnesses include heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heatstroke. Heat cramps are painful spasms, often occurring in the muscles of the legs and abdomen. <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION> experts in weather and health recommend firm pressure on the cramping muscle followed by gentle massage. Give the victim water to drink. Heat exhaustion, they point out, is more serious. Symptoms include heavy sweating, weakness; cold, pale, clammy skin. The victim may faint or vomit. Treatment includes getting the victim out of the sun to a place where they can lie down and loosen their clothing. Get them to a fan or air conditioned area if possible, and apply cool, wet cloths. Give water to drink. If vomiting continues, seek medical attention. The most dangerous condition is heat stroke, also known as sunstroke. In this case the body temperature can rise to dangerous levels, skin is hot and dry, pulse rapid and the victim may become unconscious. Heat stroke is a severe emergency; summon medical assistance or get the victim to a hospital, <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION> warns. Delay can be fatal. While waiting for help, get the victim to a cooler environment, use fans or air conditioner and cool sponging, but do not give fluids, the agency says. Here is a list of summertime suggestions from <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION> aimed at preventing heat-related illnesses: _ Slow down Strenuous activities should be reduced, eliminated or rescheduled to the coolest time of the day. _ Dress for summer Lightweight, light-colored clothing reflects heat and sunlight and helps maintain normal body temperature. _ Eat less Foods like proteins increase metabolic heat production and also induce more water loss. _ Drink plenty of water Your body needs water to keep cool, so drink plenty of fluids even if you do n't feel thirsty, but avoid or reduce use of alcoholic beverages. Persons with fluid restrictions or with epilepsy, heart, kidney or liver disease should consult their doctor. _ Do not take salt tablets unless directed by a physician _ Do not get too much sun Sunburn reduces the skin's efficiency at cooling the body. _ Spend time in air conditioned places If you can not afford home air conditioning, spend some time in another air conditioned environment such as a shopping center or other commercial building.

The bra is festooned with multi-hued bows. The gloves are covered with buttons of every size and color. Her fingernails are painted a vivid orange. Her earrings are tiny, multi-colored abacuses. <PERSON> Ortelli </PERSON> laughed. `` I play <PERSON> Lupe </PERSON> on the show, and <PERSON> Lupe </PERSON> is just an extension of myself,'' she said. `` She's the cook, but she's a little weird.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Computer companies face an awful dilemma each time they introduce a new product _ to bore the audience with bits and bytes, or gag it with glitz. This past week, just when cool and dry seemed to be the trend, a pair of multimillion-dollar events showed that computer companies still love show biz. On Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> unveiled two personal computers by filling a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> stage with electronic music and athletic ballet dancers in shiny, multi-colored body suits. A day later, <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> announced new mid-sized computers with an Academy Awards-style show beamed by satellite to 100,000 people across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ the biggest such broadcast ever by a private company. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> executive, gamely followed a script that had him receiving a lollipop, a loan approval and a toy soldier's hat from actors portraying grateful <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> customers. At first it seems incongruous for computer makers _ the vanguard of the rational age of high technology _ to be falling back on pyrotechnics and emotional appeals. But then again, people are people, and no one gets a big charge out of hearing someone in a suit drone on about 48-bit addressability or 82385 cache memory controllers. `` We punctuate the straight business message with a little glitter, like the machines rising out of the floor, to make it a little more warm and a little less formal,'' said <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Reisman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s assistant group executive for the <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. Glitter is second nature to <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION>, which in 1985 hired the Pointer Sisters to dance on a huge model of its Portable 286 singing, `` I'm So Excited.'' Still, the Houston-based computer maker wants to be taken seriously. `` It's not just that we're interested in throwing a party,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Arezzo </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for corporate marketing. `` The bottom line is, you're trying to capture mind space: of the press, the analyst community and most of all your authorized dealers.'' Yes, but how much glitter is too much glitter? `` We've got event-inflation, I think,'' complained <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>, editor and publisher of Release 1.0 newsletter and a veteran of uncounted product introductions. `` I really hate the ones where they give you 10 minutes of rock music in the dark,'' she said. `` My basic feeling is, if I want to see dancing I'll buy a ticket and go with a date.'' <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, with more than $ 50 billion in annual revenue, must be doing something right. But some people who attend its shows say they have gone from dull to slightly embarrassing. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Machrone </PERSON>, editor-in-chief and publisher of <ORGANIZATION> PC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION>, cringes in memory of an event last year at which <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> executives fumbled through a supposedly impromptu and humorous interchange with <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> <PERSON> Farr </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON>, the former `` M-A-S-H'' characters. `` It's painful to watch, but <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, I think they think they're really rocking and rolling when they do this,'' <PERSON> Machrone </PERSON> said `` People are afraid to tell them otherwise.'' That's a slightly harsh assessment, said <PERSON> Nora </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gildea </PERSON>, director of marketing for <ORGANIZATION> Ideassociates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Billerica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, a company that does business with <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>. `` It was OK. Everybody sort of laughed wryly in our group You're talking about seasoned customers who've been to a lot of these things.'' <ORGANIZATION> Commodore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> introduced its Amiga three years ago by having <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> take a digitized image of <PERSON> Blondie </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> and use the computer to `` paint'' her picture live on stage at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Lincoln Center <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> once made its chief executive <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Canion </PERSON> appear from nowhere on stage in a blaze of light. It was especially entertaining because <PERSON> Canion </PERSON> is the ultimate straight man. `` I think he sleeps in his suit and tie. So that was a magical moment,'' Ms. <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has gotten quiet after a run of announcements that included lowering its Apple IIgs from the ceiling into a blaze of lasers and dry ice. Once Apple revved up a sales or dealer meeting with a version of `` Ghostbusters'' featuring dancers in radiation suits, Macintoshes strapped to their backs, singing `` Blue Busters.'' Apple spokeswoman <PERSON> Marlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> has been concentrating lately on networking and communications products that are n't suited to media blitzes. She vows <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> will be back with a splash when the time is right.

 Splashy product introductions are intended less for reporters than for customers, dealers, distributors and a company's own employees. For <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION>, which relies heavily on authorized dealers who are n't on the <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> payroll, an inspirational announcement is critical. `` We're trying to create an impression with the people that have to understand and believe in the product before they can sell it,'' said <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON>, president and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> MultiMedia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Culver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, which staged Monday's <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> show.

<HEAD>Is Dollar's Big Rise the Magic Bullet for Wall Street?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar's stunning rise this past week may have provided the psychological lift that some traders say the stock market needed to restart its widely touted summer rally, but others are n't so sure. It was on Wednesday, the first full day of summer, that the dollar leaped in value against key foreign currencies, inciting a strong rise in stock prices and propelling the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average to the highest point since the October crash. `` It's taking down some of the psychological and fiscal barricades,'' <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Peroni </PERSON>, a technical strategist for the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Janney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said of the dollar's surge. `` I think the market is better poised now to respond to good news and glad tidings.'' Asked if the market's behavior Wednesday may have marked a turning point, <PERSON> Peroni </PERSON> said: `` I think it could very well play that way, yes.'' Two weeks ago, many Wall Street brokers were talking about a pre-season summer rally that they say began at the end of May. Many predicted a further revival of enthusiasm for stocks despite any big change in the economic news. The following week, the Dow industrials hit two post-crash highs but tumbled on fear of rising interest rates. The summer-rally promoters said maybe the season had n't begun after all. But this past week, the rising dollar restored market confidence by doing two good things, optimists argue. First, it eased fears of rapidly rising inflation caused by a cheap currency, which makes imports more expensive. Secondly, it encouraged a return to the stock market by foreigners, whose post-crash absence had been sorely missed by Wall Street. Foreign buying was widely evident Wednesday. The most obvious sign was a surge in stocks such as <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, which historically attract overseas interest because they're so well-known. Skeptics argue the dollar's surge was n't a long-term trend and should not be the sole basis for buying stocks. Many attribute the market's rise to other transient causes, such as the end-of-quarter `` window dressing'' period when money managers buy stocks to make their client portfolios look better. As evidence for their argument, they say a fundamental market rally lasts for several days and is marked by heavy trading volume. It has n't happened. Stock prices weakened Thursday and Friday and the volume was moderate. `` I think it's a bear market, this is what happens in bear markets,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, a technical strategist and vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. International `` I do n't think this thing is the beginning of something long and sustainable.'' For the week, the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> industrials finished at 2,142.96, a gain of 38.94 points or 1.9 percent. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> averaged 170.99 million shares a day, compared with 201.64 million a day the previous week. Among the broader market barometers, the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> composite index ended the week 1.72 points higher at 154.56; the <ORGANIZATION> NASDAQ </ORGANIZATION> composite index for the over-the-counter market rose 4.70 points to 391.62; and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> market value index rose 2.79 to 308.49. By the end of the week, summer-rally skeptics offered another argument against putting too much faith in the power of the dollar's advance. They said talk had resurfaced that the dollar might get too expensive and hurt the nation's gradually narrowing trade deficit. `` The psychology in this market is crazy,'' said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Puccio </PERSON>, senior vice president and manager of institutional trading at <ORGANIZATION> Dillon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Read </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Before they liked the dollar where it was. Now the dollar is going up so they're starting to get worried. People are getting so analytical they're losing sight of the long-term. It's really putting the skids on this market.''

<HEAD>Bond Prices Follow Rising Dollar</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Bond prices danced to the dollar's tune this past week, and the results gave bondholders reason to smile. But what is going to happen when the upbeat music ends? `` The dollar is on a temporary run, and if you want to join the party, you had better belly up to the bar quickly before they quit serving free drinks,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON>, economist for <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. When the dollar stops rising, <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON> said chances increase that bond prices are going to slip and interest rates will edge higher. The dollar climbed sharply this week after the major industrial nations meeting in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> reaffirmed their support for stability of the dollar in foreign-exchange markets. As the dollar rose, foreign investors decided dollar-denominated securities looked even more attractive, and their buying ignited a powerful rally in <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> notes and bonds. On Wednesday, prices of the bellwether 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issue climbed $ 18 for every $ 1,000 in face value while its yield skidded to 8.91 percent from 9.08 percent the previous evening. By midday Friday, prices were up another $ 5 for every $ 1,000 in face value for the week and yields fell to 8.86 percent compared with 9.09 percent at the end of the previous week. But one question facing bond investors at the end of the week was what will happen if the dollar's climb runs out of steam? The analysts say it may force the market to focus again on economic fundamentals. And there is wide disagreement on what the fundamentals show. <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, said he finds evidence of solid growth in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and abroad that will generate gains in inflation to the detriment of bond prices. `` It's my belief that this rally is going to be short-lived and it's not a trend,'' he said. `` Rates will head generally higher with sporadic rallies like this last one creating volatility along the line.'' By the end of the year, <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> expects the 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> will yield about 9.9 percent, or a full percentage point higher than its current level. <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON> said he sees some negative signs for the bond market _ industrial production remains strong, factories are operating near full capacity and industrial commodity prices such as aluminum, zinc and nickel are rising. That could push inflation higher, possibly prompting the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to encourage higher interest rates. He expects the long <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s yield will rise to 9.75 percent before settling down to about 9.5 percent at the end of the year. But <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancorporation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, said he finds mixed evidence on the strength of the economy in the latest economic reports, and expects a slowdown is imminent. This past week, for instance, the government reported a 2.2 percent decline in durable goods orders for May and said the economy grew at a 3.6 percent rate in the first quarter after adjustment for inflation, down from its 3.9 percent growth estimate a month earlier. <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said he expects long-term rates to fall to 8.75 percent by the end of the year and 8 percent by the middle of 1989 as a reduction in capital spending leads to a broader economic slowdown. <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON>, research director for the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Jenrette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, is even more optimistic about chances for lower rates. He said he thinks a moderation in economic growth over the next few months will send long-term rates to the 8 percent to 8.25 percent range by fall. <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> worries about the impact that the drought may have on the economy, but it is n't the concern you might expect. While he expects the drought to push food prices higher, he does n't think the increase will add much to overall inflation. <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> is more concerned about the psychological damage that higher food prices may have on consumers' willingness to spend, a key factor in keeping the economy growing. `` Once they see food prices increase, we may have a break in consumer confidence,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 The consumer spending boom could slow this summer, some economists said after the government reported a modest increase in personal spending and personal income for the month of May. A rise in the dollar on Friday helped the bond market, but stocks slipped. Most grain prices retreated in response to scattered showers, while energy futures prices dropped. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 5.33 points to 2,142.96, finishing the week with a gain of nearly 2 percent. The dollar's rise carried it past key psychological resistance points to levels against many major currencies not seen in eight months.
