<HEAD>'60s Drug Guru Timothy Leary to Have Head Frozen After Death</HEAD>

 Sixties drug guru <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Leary </PERSON> said he's signed up to have his head removed and frozen after he dies for possible resurrection, but he admits the technology is `` a long shot. `` I do n't want to just go belly-up when my <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> runs out,'' said the 67-year-old former <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> psychology professor who once advised the youth of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to `` tune in, turn on and drop out'' with mind-altering drugs. <PERSON> Leary </PERSON> said Thursday he's formalizing a $ 35,000 agreement to have his head preserved for posterity in so-called `` cryonic suspension'' by the <ORGANIZATION> Alcor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Extension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION>. `` It's the second dumbest idea in the world,'' <PERSON> Leary </PERSON> said of cryonics, the practice of freezing the recently dead. `` The first is that you go to the worms. It's a long shot but it's worth a try.'' <ORGANIZATION> Alcor </ORGANIZATION> is best known for a long-running battle with authorities about whether an elderly woman client was actually dead when her head was surgically severed and immersed in liquid nitrogen. A judge backed <ORGANIZATION> Alcor </ORGANIZATION> in its refusal to turn in the head for tests, and the matter remains at a standoff. <PERSON> Leary </PERSON>, who recently has been appearing at colleges and nightclubs after years of relative obscurity, said he has followed developments in cryonics since 1976, when he wrote a paper on 22 alternatives to `` involuntary, irreversible death.'' `` He's been interested the last 30 years in any cutting edge technology,'' explained his agent, <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>. `` And this, if you'll pardon the expression, is cutting edge technology.'' For his $ 35,000, <PERSON> Leary </PERSON>, who says he is perfecly healthy, would become a member of the non-profit <ORGANIZATION> Alcor </ORGANIZATION> foundation. That gives him the right to have his head surgically removed after death and immersed in liquid nitrogen at minus 320 degrees Fahrenheit. <ORGANIZATION> Alcor </ORGANIZATION> also freezes entire bodies, but <PERSON> Leary </PERSON> said he could n't afford the $ 100,000 price Mainstream scientists scoff at cryonics, but adherents believe the essence of a person's mental or spiritual being resides physically in the brain. That essence could someday be transferred to a mechanically produced or biologically cloned body, said <ORGANIZATION> Alcor </ORGANIZATION>'s president, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondragon </PERSON>. `` There's about as good a chance that they'll be able to bring you back in 50 years than there is that we'll get a good president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, or that they'll find a cure for the common cold,'' <PERSON> Leary </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Leary </PERSON> does n't think his much-publicized drug use ruined his brain for revival, but is prepared: `` I'd be very happy, if they do n't bring me back, to have it turned over to the neurologists.'' <ORGANIZATION> Alcor </ORGANIZATION> has six heads and two complete bodies frozen in concrete vats of liquid nitrogen, <PERSON> Mondragon </PERSON> said. He said 109 members signed up to be suspended after they die. The controversy over the head of 85-year-old <PERSON> Dora </PERSON> <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> boosted interest in membership and <PERSON> Leary </PERSON>'s endorsement may do the same, said <PERSON> Mondragon </PERSON> `` A lot of people may have negative reactions to Dr. <PERSON> Leary </PERSON>, but people without open minds do n't generally come to us anyway,'' said <PERSON> Mondragon </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 Near the end of two days of scholarly talk about the ramifications of allowing intentionally aborted fetuses to be used for medical research, a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> advisory committee member sharpened the issue with a simple question: Will there ever be a medical benefit `` great enough'' for anti-abortionists to drop their opposition to using tissue from induced abortions? `` No,'' <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, public affairs director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, told <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, chief of neurology at <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. ` No,'' said <PERSON> Judi </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Stafford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. A few minutes earlier, <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, co-chairwoman of the <ORGANIZATION> Population </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crisis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, had acknowledged the strong opposition of anti-abortionists and said she wished there was some way to reach accommodation over the transplant issue. `` But to hold a nation hostage to a minority group who are opposed to abortion is a tragedy,'' she said. `` They must know that even if it -LRB- abortion -RRB- became illegal, it would still be done. It's just not going to go away It has been with us since the written word.'' Another member of the panel of witnesses, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorovitz </PERSON>, dean of the college of arts and sciences at <ORGANIZATION> Syracuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, told <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> he empathized with his effort to find common ground but suggested the `` intractable polarity'' of positions just outlined by his fellow panelists showed that would be impossible. In the end, <PERSON> Gorovitz </PERSON> predicted, the special advisory committee will simply have to settle on `` the position for which the arguments are best,'' with the realization that one group or the other will be unhappy. `` There is no way out of that,'' <PERSON> Gorovitz </PERSON> said. Retired federal appeals court judge <PERSON> Arlin </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, the advisory committee chairman, broke the 21-member committee into smaller groups for informal discussions Thursday night and again today. He planned to bring them together late today in hopes they could reach consensus on whether to recommend federal approval of using fetal tissue from induced abortions for research and, if so, what guidelines to recommend to guard against abuses. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said he hoped the committee could agree enough by the end of the day to allow a rough draft of a document that would be circulated for further discussion with an eye toward having a formal recommendation ready in time for presentation Dec. 1 to a standing <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> committee. Father <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, a Roman Catholic church leader from <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, drew a clear distinction between induced abortions and natural abortions in expressing his opposition to using tissue from the former. `` One might say that the American public becomes accomplices after the fact for these induced abortions'' if its institutions embrace policies that could tend to give a medical value to having an abortion, he said. Several committee members used the term `` custom pregnancy'' as a short way of raising the concern that some woman might become pregnant just to produce an aborted fetus for research _ either for financial gain or in an effort to help a sick relative. `` I do n't think people are as callous about abortion as that premise suggests,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Biomedical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> at </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Case </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` If we get to that point, I'm deeply worried.'' <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> said he was convinced that guidelines could be drawn to ensure that a woman's decision to have an abortion would be kept totally separate from the decision to allow the remains to be used for research. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> told the committee his institution has drawn its own guidelines that would exclude transplanting the tissue of a fetus into a relative of the mother. He said that was done out of safety considerations _ that whatever caused the disease in the relative might somehow be present in the offspring's genes _ but coincidentally also serves to negate concern about `` custom pregnancies.''

<HEAD>EPA Says Emission Controls May Be Better Than Planned</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> says regulations to control the volatility of gasoline and the recovery of gasoline fumes could be twice as effective as originally expected. As a result, cities close to complying with federal clean air standards will get a greater than expected reduction in ozone when <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> adopts the new rules. Implementation of the regulations had been expected to help anti-pollution efforts, but <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said Thursday the benefit would be much greater than previously believed. Earlier EPA calculations had indicated the gasoline regulations would reduce the emission of urban hydrocarbons to the atmosphere by 10 percent to 15 percent, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. `` It could be as much as twice that,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. Some cities are so close to complying with the standard that they had been expected to come into compliance simply through the retirement of older, more-polluting vehicles. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said he did not know how many cities would benefit from the new findings. But those helped the most will be areas where peak readings of ozone are `` in the 0.14 -LRB- parts per million -RRB- range'' and below, he said. Some cities may find that measures such as pollution inspections of cars will be unnecessary. There are 38 cities with peak readings of 0.14 ppm or below on <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s list of the 68 urban and rural areas that have failed to meet the nation's ozone standard. Gasoline fumes react in sunlight with nitrogen oxides from all fuel combustion to produce ozone, which is harmful to the lungs. Ozone is the constituent of urban smog that makes the chest feel tight. The federal standard calls for limiting peak ozone to 0.12 parts per million and limiting excursions above that to no more than one hour per year. Gasoline vapor emissions to the atmosphere will be reduced more than expected because the planned regulations will sharply reduce what analysts call `` running losses,'' or the evaporation of gasoline from the tank and other fuel system components while the car is moving. Current cars must meet strict standards for emission of unburned gasoline vapor out the tailpipe and for evaporation. Evaporation is controlled by a vapor recovery system which stores gasoline vapor in a cannister of activated charcoal until they can be recycled to the tank. It is tested by collecting vapor emitted when a car is stationary, and for this, the agency uses a test fuel whose volatility has remained unchanged since 1975. Actual volatility has increased sharply since then, and on hot days it can overwhelm the cannister. In such circumstances, the car can emit to the atmosphere 25 times more gasoline vapor than is permitted out the exhaust. The volatility standard will reduce these emissions and the vapor recovery regulation will ensure that more of them are captured, agency officials say. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> says this would remove a large source of urban ozone that the agency had not known was there.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> rejected student protests and issued strict new rules prohibiting students from having overnight guests of the opposite sex and reducing the amount of alcohol in dormitories. The rules were released Thursday, a day after 2,000 students converged on campus for a three-hour demonstration against the visitation policy. `` All of life after 11 p.m. has been banned at <ORGANIZATION> BU </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanbonmatsu </PERSON>, a senior at the <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION>, told the crowd. `` The administration is stunting our growth and development by denying us the right to make decisions.'' Under the new guidelines, some of which go into effect in late fall and others during spring, guests must display identification cards and leave the dormitory by 11 p.m. on weekdays and 1 a.m. on weekends. Overnight stays by members of the same sex will be allowed if roommates agree. But members of the opposite sex will not be allowed overnight. The amount of alcohol allowed into the dorms will be limited to a six-pack of beer and a liter of other alcoholic beverages for students over age 21. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Carleton </PERSON>, a university spokesman, said Wednesday's protest did not faze <ORGANIZATION> BU </ORGANIZATION> officials. `` I do n't think any demonstration would have an effect,'' said <PERSON> Carleton </PERSON>. `` What can have an effect is a reasonable discussion.'' Officials said they based their decision on `` concerns stated by students, staff and parents that residences too often have failed to provide the kind of environment where an individual can quietly study and have his or her right to privacy respected.'' <ORGANIZATION> BU </ORGANIZATION> officials cited problems such as parties, late-night group study and peer pressure to put up with overnight guests. There are 8,700 students housed in university residence halls. Parietal rules were dropped by many American colleges and universities, including <ORGANIZATION> BU </ORGANIZATION>, in the 1960s and'70s.

<HEAD>Engines Test OK From Delta Crash; More Scrutiny of Possible Pilot
Error</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal investigators say the engines from the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> jetliner that crashed last month in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> show no evidence of mechanical failure _ a finding that is focusing more attention on possible pilot error. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday the evidence shows `` that all engines -LRB- on the plane -RRB- were running as commanded and capable of producing full power at the time of impact.'' Early speculation after the Aug. 31 crash at <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, in which 14 of 108 people aboard <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> Flight 1141 died, was possible engine failure because witnesses reported fire coming from an engine. The cockpit voice recorder tape also included a reference by a crew member to `` engine failure'' seconds before the crash. But the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> said that after the three <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Whitney </LOCATION> JT8D engines were disassembled at the manufacturer's facilities in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> `` there was no evidence of pre-impact failure'' in any of the engines. The findings also seemed to rule out the possibility that an object or bird was sucked into an engine since that would have caused damage or been determined when the engines were disassembled. While the safety board is continuing to examine the possibility that there was a compressor stall because of improper air flow through an engine, investigators believe that would have to have been caused by some other irregularity. Proper air flow can be disrupted through an engine if a plane is in an unusual angle that restricts the flow of air across the wings or fuselage, according to aviation experts. Investigators have said the cockpit voice recorder tape includes at least five noises that could be engine compressor stalls, but all of them occur after the plane already was having serious problems remaining aloft. The engine findings, according to one source close to the investigation, have caused investigators to focus more closely on the possibility that an error by the pilots _ such as improperly configuring the aircraft for takeoff _ was the cause of the crash. Investigators, for example, have been puzzled by conflicting evidence as to the setting of the plane's wing flaps. According to the recording of cockpit conversation, the co-pilot acknowledged during the preflight checklist that the flaps had been set at the proper 15 degree extension. But investigators found that the flaps, which help provide more lift for takeoff, were almost completely retracted and that the flaps lever in the cockpit was in the retracted position. Further tests may show whether the crash impact might have contributed to the positioning of both the flaps and the lever or whether a mechanical failure caused the flaps not to slide into proper position. Meanwhile, the cockpit crew members, all three of whom survived the crash, have yet to provide information that might shed light on the cause of the accident. Earlier this week, Capt. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who was at the controls during the takeoff, told investigators he recalls one of the other pilots stating the flaps were properly extended, but does n't recall checking the flap indicators to verify if they indeed had been set. He said he recalls two `` loud bangs or explosions'' _ possibly engine compressor stalls caused by improper air flow _ seconds after liftoff and that the plane began to roll, according to <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> officials. The co-pilot, <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>, has told investigators he does n't remember anything after the aircraft left the gate, while the flight engineer, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Judd </PERSON>, gave only sketchy information.

 Former President <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> says the legal restrictions of the controversial War Powers Act never caused him to change any of the decisions he made during his presidency. `` I did what I felt had to be done,'' the former president told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s comment came Thursday in response to a question from Sen. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.D. </LOCATION>, about whether any of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s national security decisions were affected by the executive branch restrictions contained in the 1973 law. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> is a strong opponent of the law, as have been all presidents since the measure was enacted over President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s veto The law was a congressional attempt to check some of the power which legislators felt had greatly deepened the American role in the Vietnam War. The law directs the White House to send <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> a report within 48 hours after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel are sent to areas of imminent hostilities. Those forces must then be withdrawn within 60 days, or in some cases 90 days, unless <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> votes to allow them to remain. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> told the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> set up to study the War Powers Act that he and his successors sent 19 reports to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> under the law, although the documents were n't submitted under provisions of the act that could trigger the 60-day withdrawal period. He added, `` in the 15 years of the War Powers Resolution, it's never been implemented, never ... It's a dormant piece of legislation. It ought to be repealed.'' But <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> added that `` I'm practical, I do n't think it will be -LRB- repealed -RRB-. I support the kind of amendments'' proposed in a reform backed by leaders of both parties. The changes would eliminate the 60 - or 90-day automatic withdrawal period and would replace the reporting requirement with a requirement that a president consult with <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders about major national security decisions The latest War Powers fights have centered on President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s policy of protecting reflagged Kuwaiti tankers in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has refused to invoke the law. There have been seven votes in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on attempts to force the administration to comply with the law, but all have failed. <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> legal adviser, also argued that the law is unconstitutional. `` It incoporates a view of the relative powers of the political branches of our government, and of their proper roles, that is at odds with the Constitution's scheme and with over 200 years of relatively consistent experience,'' <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON> also objected to the 60-day restriction because `` the imposition of arbitrary and inflexible deadlines interferes with the effective and successful completion of the initiative undertaken by the president.'' `` Such limits may signal a divided nation, giving our adversaries a basis for hoping that the president may be forced to desist, or at least feel pressured to do so,'' he explained.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> had been drinking up to a fifth of Scotch whisky a day when he first sought treatment for alcoholism only several weeks after he left President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s staff, according to testimony <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON>, told a doctor that her husband drank `` bottles and bottles of wine'' the weekend before he was hospitalized on June 3, 1985, for alcohol detoxification, Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Argy </PERSON> testified Thursday at a court hearing on the former presidential aide's medical condition. <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> is trying to get a lenient sentence for lying under oath about his lobbying activities by presenting evidence that his memory was impaired by alcoholism when he gave sworn testimony before a grand jury and a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee in 1986. <PERSON> Argy </PERSON> said <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> was drinking as much as a bottle of wine or a pint of vodka a day when he was hospitalized in October 1986 for detoxification. The former deputy White House chief of staff and longtime friend of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> family faces a possible five-year term and a $ 6,800 fine for each of three perjury convictions when he appears Sept. 23 for sentencing by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Penfield </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> was found guilty of two counts of lying by telling the grand jury he could n't recall contacting former <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration colleagues on behalf of high-paying lobbying clients. The third conviction stemmed from his denial to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcomittee that he helped a South Korean trade envoy get an appointment to see the president. At Thursday's hearing, defense lawyer <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Turk </PERSON> told <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> that evidence would show that <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> was an alcoholic `` at all times relevant to the case'' and therefore his memory was impaired both during the events in question and when he was asked about them under oath. But independent counsel <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> argued that records of <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON>'s hospitalization for alcoholism in June 1985 and again in October 1986 show `` nothing to support any finding that his memory was impaired.'' `` Mr. <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON>'s ability to recall was absolutely functioning, it was just that he decided to select what he wanted to recall,'' <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> argued. Medical experts for both the defense and prosecution were expected to testify when the hearing resumed. A Roman Catholic priest who runs an alcoholism treatment center in <LOCATION> Havre </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grace </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> spent a month following his second hospitalization said the former presidential aide complained of memory blackouts when he was first admitted. Prosecutors showed the Rev. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> a treatment notation stating that during his stay <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> `` enjoyed a nightly game of Trivial Pursuits'' _ a game that challenges players' memory of facts about popular culture and other subjects. `` Many of us have a little storehouse of useless information, you can show it in a game like that,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> came to realize that his drinking problem occurred because he `` abused power and money.'' Argy, who had earlier treated <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> for kidney failure, testified that the former presidential aide called him on May 30, 1985, to seek help with alcoholism. On June 3, 1985, <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> was admitted to <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> for detoxification. The defense tried to use this testimony to show that <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> was not lying when he said he could n't recall telephoning then-Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> or White House aide <PERSON> Rogert </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> from his hospital bed on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. The calls were made `` while he was going through acute alcohol withdrawal and while he was sedated'' by tranquilizers, <PERSON> Turk </PERSON> argued. <PERSON> Argy </PERSON> said <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> received between 120 and 140 milligrams of Valium to counteract the effects of alcohol withdrawal during his three-day hospital stay. But <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> was able to show that <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> did not receive any Valium until 45 minutes after he had telephoned Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> on June 3. According to <PERSON> Argy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> was given his first tranquilizer _ a 25-milligram dose of <LOCATION> Librium </LOCATION> _ 45 minutes before the 5 p.m. call to <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, which was documented by a telephone log produced at the trial. The call to <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> was the next day. The medical testimony about <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON>'s alcoholism was not offered during the trial because defense lawyers rested their case without calling any witnesses.

<HEAD>Handgun Legislation Dropped From Anti-Drug Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Ignoring a lawmaker's plea to `` show how tough we are'' by opposing the firearms lobby, the House has likely killed for this year an attempt to force Americans to wait a week before buying a handgun. By a 228-182 bipartisan vote Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> eliminated from an anti-drug bill a seven-day waiting period along with an optional police background check of the purchaser. The vote substituted a plan _ to be devised by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> _ that would allow gun dealers to quickly identify convicted felons seeking to buy pistols. Sponsor <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> McCollum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Fla </LOCATION>., said the amendment was his own idea and the major pro-gun group, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assocation </ORGANIZATION>, came to him with its support The waiting period language was named symbolically after presidential press secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, who was shot along with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in the March 30, 1981, assassination attempt against the president by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON>, vice chair of <ORGANIZATION> Handgun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, called the vote `` disappointing and discouraging. She added, `` We came close. Twenty-four more votes would have made a difference.'' The <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>'s chief political operative, <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> LaPierre </PERSON>, predicted that any attempt to resurrect the waiting period in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> this year would fail because sentiment there was `` even stronger'' against the waiting period. To change the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> result, 24 members would have to reverse course _ a seemingly insurmountable number for such a politically sensitive issue. The three-million-member <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>, which once faced little opposition in its lobbying against gun control, was up against a formidable foe this time: a coalition of gun control groups and law enforcement organizations that was better organized than ever before. Supporters of the waiting period believed they had a better chance of winning their legislation by making it part of a popular anti-drug bill near election time. But they guessed wrong, and the coalition's predictions of a razor-close vote proved inaccurate. <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> supporters were able to muster backing from 101 Democrats and 127 Republicans. Opposing were 137 Democrats and 45 Republicans. The overall drug bill would add some $ 2 billion to the nation's $ 3.9 billion drug fighting effort A final <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote is expected next week. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> still has to consider its own drug fighting bill. In the closing moments of debate, waiting period supporter Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, urged members to `` show how tough we are when it comes to bucking the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the gun lobby.'' <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> backer Rep. <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Volkmer </PERSON>, D-Mo., said after the vote that those comments backfired `` Taking on the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> is one thing and taking on gun owners is another,'' <PERSON> Volkmer </PERSON> said. `` There's no question the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> had a lot to do with it,'' he said, but attributed most of the substitute's support to individual gun owners who contacted their lawmakers Both sides brought police officers to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to lobby for their positions. The McCollum amendment would order the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to develop _ within 180 days _ a system that would allow gun dealers to check whether the applicant is a convicted felon. <PERSON> McCollum </PERSON> has said the system, which would be submitted to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, could include a telephone check such as the one that stores use to verify that credit cards are valid. His language also requires that probation be revoked for anyone found in possession of firearms. <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Fraternal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Order </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` I do n't mind losing a fight when it's fair, but we were outgunned on this, and by outgunned I mean dollar bills. It's a shame when our congressmen have to listen to a single-shot issue group'' like the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>. Supporters of the waiting period had argued the device was effective in the 22 states that had it, citing figures that <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> screened out more than 1,500 ineligible gun applicants in 1986; and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> stopped an average of 500 felons each year from buying guns. But Rep. <PERSON> Harley </PERSON> <PERSON> O </PERSON>. Staggers Jr., D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> study `` says criminals actually avoid going through legal channels'' to obtain The institute is a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> research agency.

<HEAD>Administration Plans To Cut Security Force In Panama</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has decided to gradually withdraw small numbers of the servicemen sent to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> last spring on temporary security duty, administration officials say. The decision was made because a feared threat to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> has not materialized, according to the sources, who spoke Thursday on condition of anonymity. The sources said the move was recommended by Gen. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>. It was blessed by the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> after a review that focused on `` political sensitivities, not military requirements,'' the officials added. The sources declined to say exactly how many of the extra 2,200 security personnel sent to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> since last spring would be included in the first withdrawal. One source indicated the number would be fewer than 500, while another official said about 200 would be involved. `` This is a sensitive thing, because our opposition to the government of -LRB- strongman -RRB- Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has n't changed and we do n't want this to be misinterpreted,'' said one official. `` But there's no sense keeping extra soldiers in the country if you do n't need them. Separately, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials said Thursday the administration has decided to reduce the size of its diplomatic presence in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> because of what one official called a `` potentially confrontational situation'' in that country. The extent of the diplomatic cutback was not immediately determined, but one official said up to 160 jobs could be affected. Officials who disclosed the planned withdrawal of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> security forces from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> said the cutbacks will be carried out gradually. `` They will come out over a period of time,'' a source said. `` We do n't want to fly in empty aircraft and load them up all at once and have <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> claiming he won. `` The situation has not improved, but these people are n't needed for the mission they were sent in for.'' Said another official: `` Most of these security personnel were put on as guards at the military installations, and we have n't been experiencing harassment in that area. `` We've been having problems with other things besides gate security. So if you do n't have enough for them to do, there's no reason to extend their tour or to replace them with fresh units.'' The sources said the decision to begin drawing down the extra security personnel amounted to acknowledgement of a standoff with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> that features harassment but no direct threat to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> facilities. `` The Panamanian Defense Forces continue to hassle Americans when they travel off-base, and we still have occasional intruders at our -LRB- oil -RRB- tank farm,'' said one official. `` But the bases themselves have really not been threatened.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been pressing economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> for months now in a bid to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The Panamanian general has been indicted by two federal grand juries in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on drug trafficking charges. Last March and April, citing growing `` instability in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and the heavy-handed tactics of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in dealing with the situation,'' the Pentagon began sending <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> military police and security specialists to the Central American nation. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> _ besides being the site of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> _ is the home of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, the organization responsible for all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military forces in Central and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. About 10,000 American servicemen and a like number of dependents are stationed there permanently. Over the course of the two-month build-up this spring, the Pentagon moved an extra 2,200 servicemen into <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> on temporary duty status to augment the roughly 600 security personnel assigned there permanently. The issue of withdrawing those servicemen and replacing them arises now because under military regulations, a temporary duty assignment can not last more than 180 days.

 The incessant surf rolled in a little higher than normal and even though it was late summer, the peak time for tropical storms, people were n't too concerned. After all, this was <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION>, the largest and most prosperous town in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the Wall Steet of the <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>, and it had weathered storms before. In September 1900, in the days before radio and satellite photographs, people had no idea that out in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> a monster storm was brewing that would change <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> history and bring death and terror on a scale that never has been seen before or since in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. On Sept. 8, 1900, <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> was home to nearly 38,000 people. When the sun rose the next day, nearly one-sixth of the city's residents were dead, victims of buildings toppled by winds and waves, drowned in the 15-foot storm surge, mangled by flying debris or washed out to sea The death toll was put at 6,000, but it's uncertain how many thousands of others were lost. `` Nobody knows the complete story of what happened at <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION>; nobody ever will know,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Weems </PERSON> wrote in his classic account of the storm, `` A Weekend in September.'' Ironically, the book, written in 1956, was re-released this month to mark the 88th anniversary of the great <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> storm. `` Most of them wanted to talk,'' <PERSON> Weems </PERSON> says now, recalling his conversations with storm survivors. `` The tragedies were still with them, but enough time had passed so they could talk about them. `` I got the idea some of them might be paying respect to their dead friends and relatives by talking about them.'' Although <PERSON> Weems </PERSON> believes all the hundreds of survivors he interviewed have died since, <PERSON> Jennie </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Karboski </PERSON> is among the few still living who were there. And what she remembers most is the water, angrily rising _ and the bodies, floating everywhere. Mrs. <PERSON> Karboski </PERSON> is now 100 and lives with her daughter in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. She was 12 and growing up in <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> when the storm hit. `` They tried to have mass burials at sea, but the next morning many floated back in on the surf,'' she told the <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION> this week. `` The men had to dig trenches and burn them. My dad said they kept the work crews drunk. They had to.'' After a harrowing journey by rowboat and horse cart, Mrs. <PERSON> Karboski </PERSON>'s family found shelter in a Catholic seminary. Others who survived huddled in a lighthouse or a storm-tossed ship or crammed inside the upper stories of their homes. Others clung to wreckage until the waters receded. Perhaps the most lasting monument to the 1900 storm is the <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> seawall, a concrete embankment 17 feet above mean low tide built after the great storm to ward off future huge storm surges. It has helped to moderate damage from hurricanes since. A more significant effect, however, was that many businessmen who considered <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> the hub of activity for <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> decided they would not put themselves through another such storm. They moved inland about 50 miles to a mosquito-infested swamp town called <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, which 88 years later is the nation's fourth-largest city

 But for the summerlong writers' strike, the fall television season would have begun Monday with typically fervent competition among the three networks and an advertising blitz for their new shows. But network competition has been sidelined for the next couple of weeks as the 1988 Summer Olympics play in prime time on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, while <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> _ their new fall shows delayed for weeks by the strike _ basically twiddle their thumbs. CBS is even hoping the Olympics do well for <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. `` We face, absent the Olympics, an audience that's going to be more restless than usual,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Poltrack </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> vice president for marketing. `` If they're going to find a place to be diverted to while waiting for the season to be launched late, the Olympics is where I'd like to see them go, not to independent stations or cable networks. `` So at this point in time, we'd like to get the majority of the audience that the Olympics do n't get, but I'd like to see the Olympics do well.'' CBS is also hoping good <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> numbers will help when <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> sells advertising in the 1994 Winter Olympics. CBS is also seeking rights to the 1992 summer games. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> is counter-programming the Olympics with half-hour comedies, but it, too, has basically forfeited the lion's share of television viewers to <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. `` We tried to do it with a little bit of fun, a sense of humor,'' said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wurtzel </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for marketing. `` Recognize something comes along every four years, and we know we're not going to beat it.'' CBS is running movies and first-run sitcoms against the Olympics in an effort to draw as many kids and older people, the groups least likely to be avid watchers of the Olympics. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> has decided that if the Olympics are high drama, they'll counter-program with laughs The network has scheduled a month of repeats of top <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> sitcoms, plus comedy movies and specials. `` What we did was, we looked at basically what did best against us when we had the Olympics in the past, how our competitors fared,'' said <PERSON> Wurtzel </PERSON>. `` What we learned was people kind of dipped in and out of the Olympics. They do n't necessarily like every event. Programs that did best were half-hour comedies.'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> is predicting it will average about a third of the prime-time viewing audience with Olympics. Because of the strike delay, the networks are at odds over when the new television season should be declared open. Advertisers buy commercials based on viewership of individual shows, so they do n't care who wins the seasonlong horse race in the <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> ratings. But it is an image contest. Not surprisingly, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> believes the new season should begin Monday, since it will have undoubtedly big ratings for the Olympics which would count on the season. `` We did not have the start-time problem that some other people may have, so we're taking the traditional outlook and starting on the 19th,'' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Boehme </PERSON>, director of audience measurement at <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. `` Several broadcasters do n't have original programming. I'm sure they would prefer to start it at a later time. From our perspective, we have our programming in place, and we do n't think it would be fair to us to delete first-run programming from the season,'' he said. <PERSON> Wurtzel </PERSON> says <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> is marking the new season from about Oct. 24, the week in which it will have half its new programs on the air. <PERSON> Poltrack </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> would also have the season start Oct. 24 for the same reason. If the late start is confounding the networks, viewers could benefit. Even though the television season is starting late, the networks have nevertheless put in orders for a full season's supply of episodes for most series. That means fewer reruns next spring.

 With Yellowstone National Park's wildfires still burning, the famous tourist attraction's gateway cities already are planning ways to lure visitors to the charred landmark next summer `` The geysers are still there, the waterfalls are still there, the elk and bison and bears are still there, the streams and fish are still there,'' said <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, executive director of the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. `` Our job will be to get out the message that ` Yes, there is still the Yellowstone you love and remember, despite the forest fires.''' While the key landmarks are still there, so is a mosaic of charred trees as a dozen enormous fires have blazed across nearly half of <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s 2.2 million acres in the past two months. The flames forced frequent evacuations of campgrounds and lodging facilities, and blanketed thousands of square miles with smoke. The park's tiny gateway communities are vitally linked to the giant wilderness, which in a normal year attracts 3 million visitors. Towns with economies strongly dependent on <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> include <PERSON> Gardiner </PERSON>, Silver Gate, <ORGANIZATION> Cooke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cody </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>; and, to a lesser degree, <PERSON> Driggs </PERSON> and <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. Officials say that so far this year, tourist visits to <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> are down 12.5 percent from last year's figures, a loss of more than a quarter million visitors. Many merchants and innkeepers are wondering about the long-term economic impact of the worst fires in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> in 300 years. `` A month after the fires are out, or at least after they're off the TV nightly news, we want a market research firm to do attitude perception surveys to find out what people think about a vacation in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. `` Will they be interested? What will they expect to see? Our guess is that memory is short. Nobody can even remember a hurricane name from last week. My hunch is, people will want to come see what happened here.'' <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Tedder </PERSON> of park concessioner <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, which runs <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s lodging, restaurants and transportation services, expects sales to be down $ 4 million to $ 5 million _ a 25 percent drop from last year. `` It certainly has been an interesting summer,'' he said wryly. `` July and August traditionally are our biggest months, when we make up for the losses of our winter operation. It has been very dramatic _ devastating from a visitor standpoint and an operations standpoint. To date, we've had to give early release to about 800 employees. I think it was by the grace of God that we have not lost any major structures.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>' marketing director, said the fires have had a strong effect on the entire region. `` We have got a big job this fall just convincing the local people to come back,'' he said. `` Then we have to look at the national and international markets. I know we've got a heck of a problem.'' <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> is busy accumulating videotape and photographs showing that many areas of the park are unaffected by the fires `` so we can be sure we're telling the true story.'' He already has traveled to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to talk about <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> with key tour group operators and newspaper travel editors. In addition, some <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wyoming </ORGANIZATION> students are using computer lists to contact tourists who canceled their reservations at <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>, and find out why. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, executive director of the Cody, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, hopes the federal government will step in to help, noting that a portion of profit from concessions within the park goes for park improvements. `` We're not looking for a handout or a giveaway, but it's going to be very difficult to add on any extra expense,'' said <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>. `` The federal government is spending $ 100 million to fight the fires, so it does n't seem unrealistic to think an extra $ 2 million could be spent to get people to come back to <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>'s tourism promotion effort, said <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwinden </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> will be asked by their states' travel and tourism officials to seek federal disaster money for the park's gateway communities.

 Captain <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> of the starship Enterprise looks skyward from a lonely, wind-blown planet and says: `` Entapuraizu, riku kara tenso shite kure.'' For those listening to the English version of `` Star Trek,'' Captain <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> would have said `` Enterprise, beam me up.'' Dubbed in Japanese, `` Star Trek'' is just one of many vintage American TV programs boldly exploring the late-night <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> airwaves. During a typical week, insomnia-stricken viewers in the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> area can watch `` <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>'s Law,'' the 1960s adventure show starring <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> as a debonair <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> police chief; <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Serling </PERSON>'s `` The Twilight Zone,'' the acclaimed science fiction series; `` Bonanza,'' one of television's longest running Westerns, starring <PERSON> Lorne </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>; `` The Beverly Hillbillies,'' the antics of a backwoods family in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>' elitist neighborhood; `` Mission: Impossible,'' the acclaimed <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Geller </PERSON> adventure series; and `` The Addams Family,'' a sitcom based on <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Addams </PERSON>' bizarre magazine cartoon characters `` I do n't have any statistics on this,'' said <PERSON> Yoshihiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Mishima </PERSON> of the TV <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> network, `` but we think the people who stay up to watch these programs are looking for a bit of the good old days, when they might have been too young to watch the original broadcasts.'' <PERSON> Mishima </PERSON> said the viewers are mainly college students or adults in their 30s. `` It's part of the ` retro boom,''' he said, referring to a recent trend among some Japanese to seek out things from the past. But American TV shows are nothing new to the Japanese audience. `` There have been American programs on Japanese TV for decades, going back to ` <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>' and ` Rawhide,''' <PERSON> Mishima </PERSON> said. `` They've lost popularity to domestic programing, but people still watch them to get a look at <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Yuji </PERSON> <PERSON> Tagami </PERSON>, an editor with TV Station magazine, added, `` They can develop devoted fans, but ratings for late-night American programs in general are not very high.'' Limited viewership did not stop the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> Broadcasting System from putting the `` Nostalgic American TV'' series on its schedule last October. Since March, the series has included: `` <ORGANIZATION> Surfside </ORGANIZATION> 6,'' a'60s detective series set in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, starring <PERSON> Troy </PERSON> <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON> and <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>; `` Combat!'' the longest of the World War II adventures, starring the late <PERSON> Vic </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrow </PERSON>; and `` Superman,'' starring <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Reeves </PERSON>. `` Ratings are n't a good way to judge late-night television shows' popularity. In that time slot, viewership is small and more personal. Viewers are more attached to what they watch,'' said <PERSON> Masato </PERSON> <PERSON> Ueda </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> TBS </ORGANIZATION> producer of the series. To young viewers, the appeal of the rejuvenated old programs is in their `` newness,'' <PERSON> Ueda </PERSON> said. `` We decided to go with the series when we went on the 24-hour broadcasting schedule, and though the ` retro boom' was a part of the decision, we wanted to give young people something completely new, which to them these programs are.'' Many of the American programs also feature bilingual broadcasts, with the original English-language dialogue simultaneously aired on a subchannel available on specially equipped TV sets.

<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> switched the other day and decided to release overdue payments to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, it was another sign that as far as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign policy is concerned his views have undergone extensive alteration since he entered the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> nearly eight years ago. Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> explained the surprising switch on the dues as based on a determination by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> that the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> had `` reformed its operation.'' That does n't alter the fact, however, that one of the tenets of the political philosophy that nurtured <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and gave identity to his pursuit of the presidency was severe skepticism of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. Conservatives always have complained that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> paid a disproportionate share of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> bills while serving as a convenient target of the Soviet bloc and the so-called non-aligned countries. But <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to ante up, and another corner was turned. In his twilight months in the White House only his commitment to guerrillas trying to overthrow the Sandinista government in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> remains uncolored by the pragmatic fact that the Contras are not making much headway. On arms control, after campaigning in 1980 against all major accords with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and putting negotiations on a back burner for months, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> gradually adopted a stance that even diehard opponents grudgingly acknowledged was far friendlier to arms control than they had expected. They still are worried he may try to unravel the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty before heading home to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, but the new 1987 accord to ban intermediate-range nuclear missiles is safely on the books. It stands as the only U.S.-Soviet agreement to eliminate an entire category of nuclear weapons, and it was negotiated on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s watch. Meanwhile, four summit meetings with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> have produced a conciliatory stance in the White House that is in striking contrast to early <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> rhetorical flourishes that included castigating <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> as an `` evil empire.'' Until November 1985, he was the first American president since <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> not to have met with a Soviet leader. Now he has held more one-on-one superpower summits than any of them. Ironically, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has moderated his arms control policy to such an extent that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who is a liberal Democrat, suggested this week in outlining a nuclear missile strategy agenda that his views were not that far from the president's. The biggest difference is over <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Strategic Defense Initiative. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he would `` stop pouring billions and billions of dollars'' into the pursuit of a space-based defense against Soviet ballistic missiles. But he said he would continue a modest research program into possible missile defenses. The Republican candidate, Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who projected himself in 1980 as a moderate alternative to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s deep conservatism, is working overtime, meanwhile, to align himself with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s foreign policy initiatives His pitch essentially is that he would continue along the same course if he is elected. Having been part of the administration, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s job in lining up with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> policies is hardly as difficult as the task confronting <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. But the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate's agenda on weapons moved him closer to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has voiced concerns about the costs of the B-1 bomber and the Midgetman missile, but he endorsed production of the Trident II submarine-launched missile and four other weapons. More significant, perhaps, was his vow that `` We'll use force when it's necessary to protect our territory, our citizens or our vital interests; to meet our treaty commitments; and to deter or to respond to terrorist attacks.'' The words were <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s but if you close your eyes and let your mind drift back to 1980 they might just as well have been <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s.

 Ladies and gentlemen, sharpen your scalpels. The show that dares to comment on <PERSON> Patti </PERSON> <PERSON> LuPone </PERSON>'s diction, <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON>'s acting ability, <PERSON> Nell </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s figure and <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Brightman </PERSON>'s overbite has returned with malice and entertainment for all `` Forbidden Broadway 1988,'' which arrived Thursday at off-Broadway's Theater East, is the latest edition of <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Alessandrini </PERSON>'s vest-pocket musical revues that mercilessly spoof the Broadway theater. And it's the best version of the show yet. In more than 25 musical sketches, a hard-working company of four, plus pianist <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Fortenberry </PERSON>, takes aim at some of Broadway's biggest hits including `` <LOCATION> Les </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miserables </LOCATION>,'' `` The Phantom of the Opera,'' `` M. Butterfly,'' `` Speed-the-Plow,'' `` Anything Goes'' and `` Into the Woods.'' They score a bull's - eye nearly <PERSON> Alessandrini </PERSON>, who devised the show and supplied the new lyrics as well as the direction, is a master at deflating bombast. Consider his blitz of `` Les Miserables'' _ a mock mini-musical that deflates the big Broadway blockbuster. It's not easy simulating <PERSON> Trevor </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>'s turntable staging, but <PERSON> Alessandrini </PERSON> comes up with credible and hilaroius copy of it here. But then he also supplies a chandelier for something called `` The Phantom of the Musical,'' a duet for a masked <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Webber </PERSON> and a buck-toothed Miss <PERSON> Brightman </PERSON>. The author is equally effective at lancing big-time personalities. There's a narcissistic Miss <PERSON> LuPone </PERSON> mushmouthing a Cole Porter-style ditty called `` I Get a Kick Out of Me.'' Or an exasperated <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mamet </PERSON>, author of `` Speed-the-Plow,'' singing, to the tune of `` The Rain in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>,'' `` We strain in vain to train <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON>'s brain.'' The performers, particularly the two women, are superb mimics. <PERSON> Toni </PERSON> <PERSON> DiBuono </PERSON> does a terrific <PERSON> LuPone </PERSON>, and a powerhouse <PERSON> Ethel </PERSON> <PERSON> Merman </PERSON> who battles it out on stage in a duet with a relentlessly perky <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, played by <PERSON> Roxie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>. Miss <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> also lacerates <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Stritch </PERSON>, parodying her `` Ladies Who Lunch'' number in `` Company'' with a song called `` Ladies Who Screech.'' The evening reaches the height of demented lunacy when <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> DiBuono </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> take on <LOCATION> Kiri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Te </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kanawa </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Carreras </PERSON> and the practice of using opera stars to record famous Broadway scores. Here <PERSON> Alessandrini </PERSON> has them singing a song from the rock musical `` Grease.'' Equally effective is <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON>'s explanation of the bizarre plot of `` M. Butterfly,'' done to the strains of `` Poor Butterfly.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> lends his booming voice to an effective sendup of <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Papp </PERSON>, called `` Papp the Knife,'' and <PERSON> Papp </PERSON>'s practice of butchering the classics. He also leads the audience in a Sondheim sing-along called `` Into the Words.'' `` Forbidden Broadway'' seems to renew itself every season with the influx of new shows. Right now, you can imagine <PERSON> Alessandrini </PERSON> looking forward with glee to `` <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>' Broadway'' and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> in `` Legs Diamond,'' both big musicals scheduled to open this season. They should provide particularly good material for his special brand of merry meyhem.

<HEAD>Farming Town Resists Immigrants, Raising Questions Of Racism</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SJOBO, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's heartland is challenging <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s generous refugee policy, raising fears that latent racism may be bubbling to the surface. It's happening in <LOCATION> Sjobo </LOCATION>, a small southern farming town where the tallest building is three stories high, downtown is one street, and everyone knows just about everybody else. The 15,000 citizens of the town and the surrounding district are holding a referendum Sunday on whether to accept about 30 refugees. It is a local issue, but the question is drawing national attention and is dominating the final weeks of the campaign for the parliamentary election on the same day. Government figures say that from 1983 to 1987, 62,600 people sought political asylum in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, a country of 8.4 million people, making it the highest per capita rate in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Last year 245 of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s 284 municipal districts took in 18,000 newcomers as the government tried to spread them outside <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> and other cities where housing is scarce. When the request came to <LOCATION> Sjobo </LOCATION>, the town council balked. It voted last autumn by 25-24 to put the question to a popular vote. Residents say the issue has split families, friends and even the town's only church. Distrust and anger stop people from talking about it any more, and a sullenness has fallen on the town. `` A lot of people are very ashamed. It's terrible,'' said <PERSON> Madeleine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramel </PERSON>, head of the local <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. `` The town has changed.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Ramel </PERSON> said the fight in Sjobo may spread to other communities that have been reluctant to take in refugees but that have been too afraid of public scorn to refuse. `` It is dangerous to ignore signals, and what is happening in <LOCATION> Sjobo </LOCATION> is one of the signals,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Ramel </PERSON>. The immigration department has said <PERSON> Sjobo </PERSON> could have a say in which immigrants would be sent. The decision has been postponed until after the referendum. An influx of immigrants from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has spawned a right-wing backlash in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> and other European countries, but that has not happened in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. `` A lot of Swedes have a negative attitude toward immigrants. It is normally surpressed, but having a referendum is bringing it to the surface,'' said <PERSON> Anders </PERSON> <PERSON> Sonnerstedt </PERSON>, a political scientist at nearby <ORGANIZATION> Lund </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` Swedish people are afraid to speak about the refugee question today, because anyone who speaks out is called a racist,'' said <PERSON> Per-Ingvar </PERSON> <PERSON> Magnusson </PERSON>, a fertilizer dealer who favors keeping the immigrants out. <PERSON> Magnusson </PERSON>, chairman of the Sjobo branch of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, denied he is motivated by racism. He said the town lacks housing and jobs for its own young people who are moving away, and he professed astonishment at the attention the town has received. `` They make us out to be stupid, fools, farmers who live in isolation,'' he said in an interview. The town simply wants to take care of its own first, he said. Mrs. <PERSON> Ramel </PERSON>, whose welfare board would handle the immigrants if they came, dismissed <PERSON> Magnusson </PERSON>'s argument. `` It's a silly question. Why ca n't 15,000 people take care of 30 more people. I think they -LRB- the opponents -RRB- just do n't want foreigners here.'' The nay-sayers in <LOCATION> Sjobo </LOCATION> have been roundly condemned by national leaders, the media and the public. One waitress complained that a customer passing through asked rudely if the restaurant `` has racism on the menu.'' <PERSON> Magnusson </PERSON> said he gets hundreds of letters of support from other Swedes. Many of them `` do n't even dare to sign their names'' for fear of being branded as a racist. <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s few openly racist groups are dismissed as an insignificant fringe. But the fight in <LOCATION> Sjobo </LOCATION> involves farmers who represent <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s roots, and a political party with long and illustrious history. The issue was an embarrassment to the national <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> during its election campaign, and party leader <PERSON> Olof </PERSON> <PERSON> Johansson </PERSON> threatened to expel the Sjobo members. `` They have made their last mistake in the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said in a television interview. The center-right party governs the local council in a coalition with the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. On the national level, it is in the opposition against the governing <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> party. Set serenely among woodlands and wheatfields, <PERSON> Sjobo </PERSON> seems hardly the scene for a national confrontation. The town of 4,000 is laid out in neat rows of single-story homes with well-trimmed gardens. The <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has said the state would pay for housing and educating the immigrants. But <PERSON> Magnusson </PERSON> said the problem goes deeper. He said the government must curb an unchecked flood of immigrants. <PERSON> Magnusson </PERSON> cited police reports that more than half the refugees seeking to live in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> destroy their passports on their way here to make it difficult to deport them. Police say as many as 25,000 people may be in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> under false identities and that as many as 15 wanted terrorists move here every year. Among them were a Palestinian who was killed by a car bomb in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> in July, and a wanted terrorist from the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> who was arrested in August by Dutch police while traveling through the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. `` There are terrorists, drug dealers and criminals coming in,'' said <PERSON> Magnusson </PERSON>. `` If the government had more control of handling refugees, there would be no need for a vote in <LOCATION> Sjobo </LOCATION>.''

 <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowden </PERSON> of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> came to this <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> resort to get a tan. He ended up spending a dark day in a rented car, reading a horror story as he rode out <PERSON> Hurricane </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, the worst storm on record. `` There was a lot of corrugated material flying about all over the place,'' said <PERSON> Bowden </PERSON>, 35. `` It was like being in an aircraft in turbulence. You felt the wind was going to lift you away.'' Other tourists crammed into <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION>'s hotels and shelters were becoming impatient by Thursday, the day after <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> blasted the <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> with 160-mph winds and driving rain. Food was in short supply, power was still out, the airport was closed and roads out of the city nearly impassable. `` Hysterical,'' one hotel receptionist said of the stranded vacationers. About 6,000 tourists were trapped in <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION> when this normally idyllic resort of sandy beaches and warm, clear waters turned into a fury of waves and wind in the predawn hours Wednesday. <PERSON> Bowden </PERSON> drove into <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION> Tuesday, only hours before the storm hit. By then, tourists at the beachfront resorts were being moved into shelters and hotels in the old part of the city, about six miles away. As the hurricane neared, <PERSON> Bowden </PERSON> also sought refuge in the city, but was turned away by hotels already jammed with guests from the luxury resorts. As <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> roared into <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bowden </PERSON> said he curled up in his car with a book, a horror story involving a magic carpet. `` I got sick of it. If I'd had some postcards I would have written them to send to people, but I did not have any,'' he said. <PERSON> Bowden </PERSON> said he watched as airborne debris zipped past his car. But even worse was the sound of two support lines of a radio transmission tower twanging `` like a badly tuned guitar'' in the wind. Shortly after dawn, the storm still raging, he said left the car, looking for some place to get a cup of coffee. Unsuccessful, he returned to the vehicle. About 150 tourists who were given refuge at city hall had nothing but milk and cookies to eat. `` I think everyone's nerves are starting to get shot now,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Camuccio </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, who had arrived in <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION> Sunday. `` Everyone is going to the same bathroom,'' he said. `` There is no water or electricity. They -LRB- the toilets -RRB- do n't flush or anything. Everybody wants to get out.'' Some tourists said they were given virtually no warning that a dangerous storm was on the way. <PERSON> Maggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Petaluma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said she had just gotten dressed to go out for the evening Tuesday when there was a knock her hotel room door and a voice said: `` You're being evacuated.'' `` I started laughing thinking they were joking,'' she said. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Effingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, who speaks no Spanish, said the language barrier added to the confusion. He and his wife, <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON>, were in <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION> to celebrate their fifth wedding anniversary. <PERSON> Nabil </PERSON> <PERSON> Nachawati </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, said his two children, ages 3 and 5, took the storm well. When the sky began to darken, the two children curled up and went to sleep.

 A woman who said a wild dog snatched and ate her newborn child has been found innocent of murder. The court decision closes the book on an 8-year-old case that divided <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and captured headlines worldwide. The Northern Territory Court of Criminal Appeal in <LOCATION> Darwin </LOCATION> on Thursday overturned <PERSON> Lindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON>'s sentence of life imprisonment with hard labor. She spent about four years in jail. It also quashed the conviction of her husband, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, a pastor for the Seventh Day <ORGANIZATION> Adventist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, on charges of being an accessory to murder. Mrs. <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON>, who was born in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, became a household name in 1980 when she said a dingo, or native Australian dog, carried off her 6-week-old daughter <PERSON> Azaria </PERSON> while the family camped in the <LOCATION> Outback </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Ayers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, a sacred aboriginal site. Replete with rumors of black magic and a suicide that led to a break in the case, the <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON> story made Page 1 in newspapers across <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and elsewhere. All Australians seem to have an opinion on the woman's story. In 1987, she was pardoned but her conviction was not overturned. Thursday's innocent verdict finally sealed the case shut. Gasps filled the courtroom when the decision was announced. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON> clasped his hands to his head and wept. His wife, who had been staring at the judges, slumped in her seat. `` The law of the land holds the Chamberlains to be innocent,'' said the ruling. The <ORGANIZATION> Chamberlains </ORGANIZATION>' defense attorney had accused the Northern Territory government, which originally prosecuted the pair, of waging a `` modern-day witchunt.'' The lawyer, <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Tipple </PERSON>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Chamberlains </ORGANIZATION> were waiting to see whether the government would pay the couple compensation before deciding on any civil action. Earlier, he said the couple was seeking about $ 750,000. After the verdict, Mrs. <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON>, a tiny woman in high-heeled red shoes, was thronged by curious onlookers as she strode with straightened shoulders from the courthouse. The crowd clamored for a closer look as the couple made their way through the large crowd to their car. Construction workers nearby downed tools and whistled while others jeered. The Chamberlain drama began on a cold night in August 1980 when Mrs. <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON> cried out at the family camp side at <LOCATION> Ayers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, central <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, `` A dingo's got my baby!'' At first, the <ORGANIZATION> Chamberlains </ORGANIZATION>' story was believed. But when the couple went to court, Mrs. <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON> was accused of slitting her baby's throat. The baby's body was never found, but bloodstains were found in the couple's tent. On Oct. 29, 1982, the <ORGANIZATION> Chamberlains </ORGANIZATION> were found guilty and Mrs. <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON> was sentenced to life in prison, where she to gave birth to a second daughter, <PERSON> Kahlia </PERSON>. Her husband was sentenced to a suspended 18-month sentence. The couple has two other sons, <PERSON> Aiden </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Although the prosecution never alleged black magic as a motive, many Australians have linked the death of baby <PERSON> Azaria </PERSON> to witchcraft and satanic rites, believing the children have mystical names. The family denied rumors that the name <PERSON> Azaria </PERSON> meant `` sacrifice in the wilderness.'' Many Australians also thought it significant that the death occurred at <LOCATION> Ayers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, sacred to aborigines in one of the most remote parts of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. In February 1986, a remarkable breakthrough in the case came when a British tourist jumped off the huge monolith to his death. Aboriginal trackers investigating the suicide found the tattered remains of <PERSON> Azaria </PERSON>'s jacket, which Mrs. <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON> swore the baby was wearing the night she vanished. The discovery of the jacket proved that Mrs. <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON> had not been lying about at least one aspect of her baby's death and prompted officials to reopen the case. Five days after the jacket was found, Mrs. <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON> was released from prison. On June 2, 1987, a federal judge pardoned her and said Mrs. <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON> may have told the truth when she said the dingo snatched and ate the baby. `` Indeed, the evidence affords the view that a dingo may have taken her,'' federal Judge <PERSON> Trevor </PERSON> <PERSON> Morling </PERSON> wrote in his opinion. But under Australian law, the pardon was as far as <PERSON> Trevor </PERSON> could go and the <LOCATION> Chamberlains </LOCATION> returned to court to overturn the conviction. `` There is no satisfaction, no joy, knowing they still believe you are guilty,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON> said at the time. Although the court case is over, the <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON> story will continue. American movie star Meryl Streep recently finished filming a movie on the case based on a book titled `` Evil Angels.'' The American release is provisionally called `` A Cry In The Darkness.''

<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 With their currency losing ground rapidly in a spiraling inflation, Peruvians are buying up refrigerators and other durable goods not likely to lose value as fast as their paper money, the inti. After two years of prosperity, Peruvians are seeing an economic turnaround that is fueling the fastest increase in consumer prices ever seen here. Independent economists conservatively estimate that inflation will pass 500 percent this year. Two years ago inflation was 63 percent. `` The country is shipwrecked in a sea of paper money,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirinos </PERSON>, an independent. `` This is a horrifying perspective and never known before in our history.'' Consumer prices shot up 30.9 percent in July alone. Peruvians are trying to adjust. They say they eat less, work more and worry a lot. `` Now I have to buy less chicken. I use it first for broth and then stew. It's the only way,'' said housewife <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> Alegre </PERSON>, while shopping in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>'s working-class La <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION> market. Nearby, tennis shoes costing 500 intis early last year were selling for 3,000 intis, equivalent to about $ 25 or half the minimum monthly wage. Cigarettes, often sold singly because many Peruvians can not afford entire packs, cost 10 intis each or seven times the January price. Analysts are now concerned that <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s inflation could boil into four-digit figures next year. The middle class has begun renting spare rooms, tutoring, knitting and sewing piece work and selling home-cooked food such as meat-filled `` empanadas'' in streetside stands to make ends meet. But <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s poor, the vast majority of the population, have been affected the hardest. `` The poorest paid people in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> are earning less money than at any time since records have been kept,'' The Andean Report, an economic monthly, said in July. An old man begging in the shadow of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>'s downtown government palace complained recently that inflation was making him poorer. `` This fills up fast but the intis are worth nothing,'' he said, jiggling the dirty plastic cup he waves to passers-by. <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON>, manager of an appliance store, said he telephones wholesalers every day to get revised prices for the television sets, stoves and toasters he sells. But business has been good, <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON> said, noting customers have pulled cash from bank accounts where the annual interest is frozen at 130 percent to buy durable goods, whose value very well could rise in an inflation. `` The only option a saver has with his money is spend it,'' said the news magazine <ORGANIZATION> Caretas </ORGANIZATION>. `` Those who do not have the ability to save will simply have to seek a second job.'' <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, 42, a married accountant with three children, said he recently began moonlighting as a curbside money trader on `` Wall Street,'' the name given by Peruvians to <PERSON> Jiron </PERSON> <PERSON> Ocona </PERSON>, a narrow downtown street where thousands of people every day now buy dollars as a hedge against inflation. He said many of his competitors are also professionals seeking to supplement inflation-pinched incomes with the small but quick profits offered by the dollar trade. Analysts say <PERSON> Jiron </PERSON> <PERSON> Ocona </PERSON> is also a financial barometer, and the recent stampede for dollars reflects Peruvians' waning confidence in the government's ability to improve economic conditions. In a recent survey, Peruvians rated the economy as the No. 1 problem, replacing a vicious leftist insurgency that was ranked first a year ago. President <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> imposed a ceiling on foreign debt payments on taking office three years ago and then used the money owed creditors abroad to finance a consumption-based economic reactivation that pulled <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> from its worst depression of the century. But heavy government spending with an expected deficit of at least 12 percent and a growing shortage of dollar reserves to subsidize imports have plunged the nation into recession this year. Manufacturing has fallen sharply, while speculation in consumer and industrial goods is rampant. Prosperity reflected by well-stocked stores two years ago has now been replaced with repeated and prolonged shortages of medicines, auto parts and basic foods, such as milk and sugar. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, a populist whose term ends in 1990, recently installed a `` war economy,'' aimed at holding down wage increases while allowing prices to rise. But economists maintain the measures are not sufficent and predict inflation will continue to soar. `` When inflation hits 500 percent, it could very easily get out of hand,'' said one leading independent economist, <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Toledo </PERSON>. `` This is my biggest concern. There will be a very high social cost and <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> is not a stable country.''

 Thousands of coastal residents from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> fled to higher ground Thursday as fierce Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> sent the first of its storms against <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> after thrashing the <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>. `` This is a killer storm,'' said <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>. `` I feel sorry for anybody wherever this hits.'' The death toll from the storm's onslaught through the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> islands and the <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> was at least 47, and damage estimates reached $ 8 billion. Jamaican Prime Minister <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON> declared a one-month public emergency. By late evening, a torrential rain was falling in <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>. At 11 p.m. CDT, the storm center was near latitude 22.8 north, longitude 94.4 west, or about 275 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, moving west-northwest between 12 and 15 mph, with maximum sustained winds of 120 mph and accompanied by a 5 - to 10-inch rainfall, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> `` If this motion continues, the center of the hurricane will cross the coast near the <LOCATION> Texas-Mexico </LOCATION> border on Friday evening,'' the weather service said. `` If a northwest turn should occur, the landfall could be further up the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> coast.'' The weather service issued a hurricane warning for <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s northern coast and the southern half of the 370-mile <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> coast from <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> O'Connor </LOCATION>, including 250,000-resident <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION> A hurricane watch remained in effect for the remainder of the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> coast, from <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> O'Connor north to <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arthur </LOCATION> near the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> border. The weather service said warnings might be extended northward, depending on the path of the 450-mile wide storm. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> sent <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> units to <PERSON> Alice </PERSON>, <LOCATION> McAllen </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Corpus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christi </PERSON>, the first such deployment for the hurricane, to assist in communications and rescue duties. <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> also issued an emergency proclamation allowing local authorities to suspend laws `` to preserve the health, safety and welfare of the public,'' including such things as the direction of travel on highways. Grocery stores ran low on bottled water, batteries, canned tuna and bread as people laid in supplies. Homeowners covered windows and doors with plywood and shatter-proofing hurricane tape. Offshore oil workers left their rigs in the Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. On <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, City Manager <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON> recommended Thursday evening that the city's 62,000 residents start evacuating. `` We are dealing with people's lives therefore at 8 o'clock we are recommending evacuation of the island. We feel that we can not wait until the morning to make that decision,'' <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON> said, adding that roadblocks would be set up at midnight on Interstate 45 to limit access to the island. In <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' southernmost city, winds began to pick up around noon under overcast skies. Police said they were asking residents to consider evacuating, but were not ordering it. `` We've never evacuated the city and the point is, where are you going to move 100,000 people?'' said Sgt. Dean <PERSON> Poos </PERSON>. A Greyhound-Trailways bus spokesman said the company was doubling its schedule of outbound buses to accommodate those fleeing the storm. <PERSON> Lorena </PERSON> <PERSON> Curry </PERSON>, who has lived in <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> since 1935, said she plans to ride out the storm. `` I've been through them before. I'm going to stick around at my home. But she added, `` I could get along without a hurricane very well.'' <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> surged into the gulf after battering the <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> with 160 mph winds, forcing tens of thousands to flee. After crossing the peninsula, <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>'s winds weakened to 120 mph, but forecasters predicted the storm would intensify again as it moves over open water. `` The shower and thunderstorm activity that we see taking place around the hurricane itself is getting better organized, more vigorous, so we think it's starting to strengthen,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheets </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hurricane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. Sheets said the hurricane's sustained winds would `` certainly increase to 130, 140 miles per hour.'' In the coastal resort of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Padre </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, about 25 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, the mayor ordered its 1,000 residents to evacuate. `` We ca n't force them to leave, but it does n't make any sense to stay,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinkerton </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, adding that water and electricity would be turned off Thursday afternoon. Tropical storm force winds, at least 39 mph, extended outward up to 250 miles to the north and 200 miles to the south of the center. The storm's first landfall earlier this week left at least 26 people dead in <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, five in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, 10 in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> and the six in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. It also left a half-million people homeless in <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> and caused widespread damage to the <LOCATION> Cayman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. The storm barreled into the Yucatan coast at dawn Wednesday, thrashing beaches with 23-foot waves, uprooting trees, knocking out electricity and water supplies and severing telephone lines. In <LOCATION> Campeche </LOCATION>, the state capital on the peninusula's west coast, boats and seaweed littered the streets of hundreds of yards from the shore after <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> passed through. `` The whole city is flooded. Everything is dark,'' said <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON>, a watchman at the newspaper Novedades de <LOCATION> Campeche </LOCATION>. `` I've lived here all my life and I have never seen bad weather like this People are scared.'' Mexican officials reported six deaths, including two babies who drowned, and at least seven people were injured, but authorities were unable to reach many isolated villages. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> pounded the provincial capital of <LOCATION> Merida </LOCATION> and the gulf port cities of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Progreso </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Campeche </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Ciudad </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON>, closing airports and roads and knocking out communications and power and flooding streets and highways. About 20,000 people were evacuated from <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Progreso </LOCATION> and other coastal towns, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> said by telephone Thursday. Hundreds of homes were destroyed, he said. On <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s northern coast, people were evacuated from fishing villages and towns into shelters in <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>, a city of 400,000 about 12 miles inland near <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>. The hurricane center said <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> at one point was the most intense storm on record in terms of barometric pressure, which was measured Tuesday at 26.13 inches, breaking the 26.35 inches recorded for the 1935 hurricane that devastated the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION>. The storm, spawned Saturday southeast of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, appeared to have hit <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> the hardest. <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON> said it destroyed about 100,000 of <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>'s 500,000 homes. He estimated damage at $ 8 billion. <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON> said in a nationwide radio broadcast Thursday that the one-month `` period of public emergency,'' including a dawn-to-dusk curfew to prevent looting, was put into effect `` to enable normalcy to resume in the shortest possible time and to allow the rebuilding process to begin.'' On Wednesday, <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> was classified as a Category 5 storm, the strongest and deadliest type of hurricane. Such storms have maximum sustained winds greater than 155 mph and can cause catastrophic damage. By Wednesday night, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hurricane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> downgraded it to a Category 4 and to a Category 3 by Thursday morning.

 Vacationers fled <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> beaches Thursday, property owners boarded up homes and businesses, and emergenc workers filled sandbags and readied shelters as powerful Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> took aim at the southern tip of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.

In the coastal resort of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Padre </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, about 25 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, the mayor ordered the 1,000 residents to leave by 4 p.m. `` We ca n't force them to leave, but it does n't make any sense to stay,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinkerton </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, adding that water and electricity would be turned off Thursday afternoon. `` It sounds facetious, but people can stay as long as we can fingerprint them so we can identify them later,'' he said. The town's government workers were packing up and moving to higher ground, at a hotel in <LOCATION> McAllen </LOCATION>, about 75 miles to the west. `` Guests are checking out in an orderly manner, boats and trailers are leaving the island,'' said <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Bushnell </PERSON>, spokesman for the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Padre </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> Visitor and <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. On <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, City Manager <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON> recommended Thursday evening that residents start evacuating. `` We are dealing with people's lives therefore at 8 o'clock we are recommending evacuation of the island. We feel that we can not wait until the morning to make that decision,'' <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON> said, adding that roadblocks would be set up at midnight on Interstate 45 to limit access to the island. Even in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, north of the most likely landfall and about 50 miles inland, the threat of <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> had an effect. Residents who remembered the damage from 1983's Hurricane <PERSON> Alicia </PERSON> taped up windows, stockpiled food and water and removed tall billboards along freeways. While some Houstonians bought bottled water, tuna fish, canned fruits and bread, residents of the exclusive <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oaks </LOCATION> neighborhood stocked up on canned crab and lobster and jars of caviar to weather the storm in style. Promoters there even decided to postpone Saturday night's sold-out show featuring <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON>, <PERSON> Liza </PERSON> <PERSON> Minnelli </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> until Oct. 9 Military aircraft from bases along the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> were flown inland to wait out the storm at places like <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, ideal because it's `` high and dry,'' said airport spokeswoman <PERSON> Marcy </PERSON> <PERSON> Blauvelt </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> was given a 27 percent probability of being the spot where <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> will hit land Friday, though a hurricane watch was in effect along the entire <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> coast as well as the northeastern Mexican coast from <LOCATION> Tampico </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> estimated maximum sustained winds at 120 mph and said some strengthening was likely with <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> headed out over the open waters of the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The hurricane, spawned last week in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, caused at least 36 deaths in three island nations and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s Yucatan and left nearly one in four Jamaicans homeless. In <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, at least 30 emergency shelters were being set up, with the <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> boarded up and designated as the first to be used. `` We are getting some sandbags ready with some volunteers in case the agencies need them,'' said <PERSON> Timo </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinojosa </PERSON>, civil defense volunteer coordinator for <LOCATION> Cameron </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. A Greyhound-Trailways bus spokesman said the company was doubling its schedule of outbound buses to accommodate those fleeing the storm. In <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>, about 170 miles up the coast, residents seemed more prepared for <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> than for previous storms, officials said. <LOCATION> Nueces </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Commissioner <PERSON> J.P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Luby </PERSON> said workers removed heavy objects from open areas, and many residents were stocking up on emergency items. Many grocery stores in <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>, the largest city on the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, had run out of bottled drinking water and some canned food. Plywood was sold out in some places. <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> asked cellular phone customers in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to try to keep the airwaves clear to allow emergency and relief workers plenty of communication space. The company loaned 100 cellular phone units to <ORGANIZATION> Corpus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christi </ORGANIZATION> officials and 100 more to cities in the Lower <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> McGeeney </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>. Two people in <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> were arrested on charges of price-gouging, and Attorney General <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Mattox </PERSON> said he has a task force to prosecute people caught raising prices to take advantage of Texans preparing for <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>. `` They are doubling and tripling prices for the products. It is unconscionable for persons to take advantage of others who are in desperate need,'' he said. On Wednesday, Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> issued an emergency proclamation allowing local authorities to temporarily suspend `` applicable rules, regulations and statutes to preserve the health, safety and welfare of the public,'' including such things as the direction of highways.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has made law-and-order a centerpiece of his presidential campaign, finds himself on the opposite side of law enforcement officials on the controversial issue of a mandatory, national waiting period for gun purchases. Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' prescription for cracking down on crime includes tougher gun controls, including waiting periods for handgun purchases. A provision calling for the handgun waiting period was eliminated Thursday in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> from a bill calling for a multi-billion dollar increase in the federal war on drugs. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> already voted overwhelmingly last week in favor of a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign promise to seek the death penalty for drug killers. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> opposed the so-called <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> amendment to the drug bill which would have required a federal waiting period. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> waged a pitched battle against it. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a lifetime <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> member, told the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizations </ORGANIZATION> in a recent survey: `` I am opposed to federal waiting period legislation; as I have stated in the past, this is a matter for the states to decide.'' Twenty-two states have laws requiring waiting periods. The House amendment is being pushed by <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, wife of White House press secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, who was one of four people shot during <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON>'s March 1981 attempt to assassinate President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s lobbying group, <ORGANIZATION> Handgun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, wants a seven-day wait on handgun purchases from licensed dealers. Under the amendment, a dealer would have to send law enforcement authorities a sworn statement including the gun's serial number and description and the buyer's name, address and birth date. The police, at their option, could perform a background check. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told the police organizations: `` I support legislation that allows law enforcement officials adequate time to review the criminal record or competency of anyone applying for a handgun permit.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' record in support of gun control, including a proposed ban on cheap `` Saturday Night Specials'' used in many street robberies, has angered gun owners in his home state of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. Signs at the state's borders call attention to its mandatory prison sentences for illegally carrying a gun. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says government should respect the right of citizens to use firearms for hunting and target shooting, and `` to own firearms to protect their homes and businesses, subject to the regulation of state and local governments.'' But the governor says `` there are too many illegally owned handguns across this nation, and we must act strongly to control the use of handguns by criminals.'' He says homicides committed with handguns claim 22,000 lives each year. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in his campaign literature, says, `` I have always opposed federal gun registration or licensing of gun owners.'' But he adds that `` we must balance the legitimate interests of gun owners with the rights of society. ... We must do all we can to keep guns out of the hands of convicted criminals.'' In a debate with other Republican candidates before the <ORGANIZATION> Gun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Owners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> last Feb. 2, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I'm not only a hunter but I'm a lifetime member of the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>. I do have a deep appreciation for the Second Amendment rights'' to keep and bear arms. He assured the gun owners he would, as president, veto a bill drafted by Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, that would ban undetectable plastic handguns as a security hazard, but he urged gun owners to work with police organizations to fashion a compromise. `` I'm making a pitch here for reason on the part of hunters,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` The last thing you want to do is find yourself opposed by those that are on the cutting edge of fighting narcotics, fighting against international terror and trying to protect international safety.'' A compromise later was reached on the plastic gun issue. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passed separate but similar measures, now awaiting final action in a conference committee. Both candidates say they support restrictions on undetectable firearms. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> running mate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, in an example of his many policy differences with the top of the ticket, opposes a nationally-mandated waiting period for handgun purchases. `` I believe it ought to be done on a state-by-state basis,'' the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator said Thursday. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s No. 2, Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, also opposes legislation that would mandate the waiting period on the national level. <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters last month that letting states decide on waiting periods `` fails to recognize the immediate danger to our police posed by the drug gangs.'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` has taken a position that is diametrically opposed to the interest of law enforcement.'' `` We are particularly concerned because Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has attempted to make law enforcement issues a central plank in his platform. ... `` said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> can not equivocate or stand with both the police and the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> on this one.''

<HEAD>Singapore Crackdown on Porkers Benefits U.S. Poultry Producers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The tiny island nation of <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> has turned into a prime market for American poultry, particularly cut up parts of chickens, an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> trade analyst says. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurz </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, until recently the agency's trade officer in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, said the country's decision to eliminate pig farms is behind the poultry boom. `` In a drive for a cleaner environment, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> has increased the tempo in eliminating all pig farms,'' <PERSON> Kurz </PERSON> said. `` Since many <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> pig farms also have poultry operations, the number of poultry farms also has declined sharply.'' Consequently, poultry production has dropped, causing <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>'s poultry imports to rise to record levels. <PERSON> Kurz </PERSON>, who now is serving with the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> agency in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, writes about the <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> poultry boom in the October issue of Foreign Agriculture magazine. Imports of chicken parts were up 20 percent, with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> accounting for more than half, nearly 25,000 metric tons. That was about six times the level of imports from <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, the nearest rival. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>'s imports of frozen whole chickens dropped 14 percent last year, reflecting a local preference for live poultry imported from <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kurz </PERSON> said. Subsidized shipments of frozen whole chickens from the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> have held <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> competition to a minimum. `` However, export opportunities for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> suppliers may lie in the emerging market for breakfast meats, particularly turkey roll and <LOCATION> turkey </LOCATION> meat,'' <PERSON> Kurz </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shipments of chilled and frozen ducks, geese, turkeys and guinea fowl also have increased and `` occupied a commanding position'' in the <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> market in 1987, he said. Is there a future for American poultry producers in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, a country less than a fourth the size of <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and a population of 2.5 million? `` Everyone involved in this market, from breeders to retailers, believes that <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>'s poultry consumption _ especially chicken meat _ will rise, although prices appear to be headed upward,'' <PERSON> Kurz </PERSON> said. The price hikes and the conversion to a pig-free environment `` do not deter optimistic forecasts as more fast-food outlets and the restaurant trade boost the consumption of chicken,'' he said.

 Limited feed supplies could slow <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s ambitious drive to boost livestock and poultry production, an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report says The current five-year plan for increasing the output of meat 18 percent from 19.3 million metric tons in 1985 to 22.75 million metric tons by 1990 is meeting with some success, the report by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. `` The limiting factor in Chinese livestock and poultry production gains will be feed supplies,'' the report said. `` In turn, feed grain imports will be constrained in the next two to three years by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s ability to earn sufficient foreign exchange for these purchases.'' <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is an important but sometimes erratic market for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farmers, and the livestock sector is watched closely for signs that more grain and feed sales may be developing. One of the problems cited in the report, which was included in the October issue of Foreign Agriculture magazine, is this year's rise in world grain prices, caused by tighter supplies resulting primarily from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drought `` Should world commodity prices remain high, the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government is likely to squeeze exports of corn and soybeans out of the domestic market in order to earn badly needed foreign exchange,'' the report said. In 1985-86, it said, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> exported more than 6 million tons of corn from its northern provinces while importing 400,000 tons into the south. `` As in the past, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will continue to export soybeans for foreign exchange and barter with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION> and other <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> countries,'' the report said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is seeking permission from the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> to field-test a genetically engineered bacterium to control a serious disease of wheat. Officials said Thursday that the test, if approved by <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, would begin next month on a 1.5-acre site at <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unversity </ORGANIZATION>'s agriculture facility near <LOCATION> Pullman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash </LOCATION> The test would be conducted by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and the university. The test would involve a USDA-discovered strain of a bacterium, pseudomonas, which controls the wheat disease called `` take all.'' The bacterium was genetically altered by <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> so it can be tracked easily in the field. `` Before the bacterium can be turned into a commercial product for use by farmers to control take all, we need to know exactly what happens when it is released into a field,'' said <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said that among other things, scientists need to know whether the bacterium spreads into surrounding plants or water, or if it survives into the following season. <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> and his colleagues at the agency's Root Disease and <ORGANIZATION> Biological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pullman </LOCATION> discovered the bacterium strain and conducted seven years of tests to prove its ability to control the wheat disease, the department said.

<HEAD>Egg Producers Urge Mandatory Testing To Eliminate Salmonella</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A government proposal for a voluntary testing program for Salmonella enteritidis _ a bacteria responsible for at least 11 deaths from Grade A table eggs since January 1985 _ is drawing fire from the poultry and egg industries. `` I'm an egg farmer. I like my job and I do n't want to make anybody sick,'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Egg Marketers association, told a panel hearing comments on the program designed to wipe out the national increase in salmonella enteritidis. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Looper </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Egg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION> said voluntary programs do n't work because, `` One state might implement the program and the neighboring state would not. This creates marketing problems.'' Another problem, he said, was, `` One-half of the hens in a state might be tested and these birds could then be reinfected by untested birds.'' The federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> recently reported a sixfold increase in the cases of salmonella enteritidis infections in humans from 1977 to 1986, said Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tauxe </PERSON> of the Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>. He noted that between January 1985 and May 1987, more than 2,000 cases, including 11 deaths, were reported. Outbreaks this year in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> prompted health officials to halt sales of eggs from at least one supplier and the formation of a joint task force of the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> which issued a four-point voluntary program to reduce contamination, <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner Dr. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. Young and Dr. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilles </PERSON>, assistant secretary of agriculture for marketing and inspection services, conducted Thursday's hearing on the program. <PERSON> Gilles </PERSON> said that while the regulatory program was distributed `` in a voluntary form, federal agencies are prepared to adopt a mandatory alternative if the voluntary approach proves unsuccessful.'' <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> and <PERSON> Looper </PERSON> were among several industry representatives who pushed the government to make mandatory the testing and monitoring of egg farms, slaughtering of infected laying flocks and diverting of any healthy eggs from such flocks to breaking plants for pasteurization as dry eggs. The industry representatives also urged implementation of a compliance mechanism, research and public education. <PERSON> Looper </PERSON> noted the unprofitability of selling eggs for pasteurization, and said the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> should use its statutory powers to enforce the regulations by seizing and eliminating the infected flocks. However, he said he was not advocating the clause in the law which gives the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> the power to jail the non-complying farmers. `` Shell egg consumption has decreased in the second quarter of 1988 by 7 percent,'' <PERSON> Looper </PERSON> said. `` Our concern for the public safety and the confidence we need from the consumer has prompted us to take extensive action within our industry,'' he said, noting that one egg association invested $ 1 million into research.'' Egg industry representatives also expressed concern about the possible effect of news media coverage of the problem. Young replied: `` We ` re not saying not to eat eggs at all, but there is a problem at this time.'' `` The most susceptible are the very old, the very young, those ladies who are pregnant and people whose immune systems are compromised _ those people with AIDS and other acquired immune diseases,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. The bulletins advise high-risk consumers to avoid eating raw eggs, lightly cooked or runny eggs and food containing raw eggs such as homemade <PERSON> Caesar </PERSON> salad dressing, Hollandaise sauce, ice cream, eggnog and mayonnaise. Commercial forms of these products are safe because they are made with pasteurized eggs. Consumers seeking more information on handling eggs safely can call <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s toll-free meat and poultry hot line, 1-800-535-4555, between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. EDT. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> residents are to call -LRB- 202 -RRB- 447-3333.

 The cost of bailing out failed savings institutions has risen so high that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will have to provide regulators with more money, according to the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, director of the finance division of the congressional watchdog agency, said he now estimates the cost of eliminating insolvent <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls at $ 45 billion to $ 50 billion, up from the $ 26 billion to $ 36 billion estimated by the agency in May. Private analysts have estimated the cost will hit $ 80 billion or more. Moreover, <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s revenue projections are `` highly optimistic,'' adding `` there is a strong likelihood they will prove incorrect.'' He testified to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday as debate intensified over whether taxpayer money will be needed to bail out the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which is funded currently by an assessment on the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L industry. `` At this point, I would say flat out that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is going to have to do this. <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> resources under any conceivable scenario will not be adequate,'' he said. The latest estimate of red ink by the bank board, which regulates 3,000 S & amp; Ls, is $ 31 billion, well within the agency's $ 42 billion projection of its revenue over the next 10 years. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> board chairman <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> last week promised to release an updated cost estimate after the fiscal year ends Sept. 30. A private consultant, <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ely </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, told the committee that the bank board already has committed itself to spend more in aid to insolvent S & amp; Ls in the form of promissory notes or guarantees against loss than it can pay for through the premiums collected from healthy institutions. <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ely </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Fernand </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> St </PERSON> <PERSON> Germain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, chairman of the committee, called on the bank board to issue more realistic projections. `` There's no question that getting it all on the table is the first requisite to dealing with the problem. Until the bank board is more willing or able to lay out the problems, it's going to fester,'' <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> St </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germain </ORGANIZATION> said, `` The bank board's shifting tote board is doing nothing to enhance confidence.'' <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyle </PERSON>, a spokesman for the bank board, said, `` We will continue to be, as we have been, forthcoming with the numbers as we derive them.'' <PERSON> Hoyle </PERSON> also said bank board revenue projections are conservative because they do not include any return from the agency's ownership stake in rescued institutions. <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ely </PERSON> criticized many of the transactions in a spate of rescues _ $ 13 billion worth over the last month _ as thin deals that bring little new private money to ailing institutions. `` Merging several insolvent institutions into a larger entity which remains thinly capitalized does not necessarily represent a final resolution,'' <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said. `` Whether or not such institutions can become viable entities without further assistance remains to be seen.''

 Twenty-five years ago, a Sunday school lesson about forgiveness ended with the blast of a bomb planted by a <PERSON> Ku </PERSON> <PERSON> Klux </PERSON> <PERSON> Klansman </PERSON>, and four black girls lay dead. Since then, <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> has learned much about forgiveness. The bombing at the 16th Street Baptist Church sparked outrage that helped fuel the 1960s civil rights movement, which eventually eased the bitter racial divisions in this city, speakers noted at a memorial service on the anniversary Thursday night. `` There has been a turnabout in human relations in this city, which now has an improved image,'' the Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cross </PERSON> told a racially mixed congregation of 1,400 people gathered to remember <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Wesley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Addie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mae </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, all 14, and <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> McNair </PERSON>, 11. `` Twenty-five years ago the only blacks at <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> were elevator operators and janitors. Now we have <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Arrington </PERSON> as mayor,'' <PERSON> Cross </PERSON> said. Cross was the church's pastor on Sept. 15, 1963, when the bomb, planted beneath basement steps, exploded after a Sunday school lesson on the theme of a love that forgives. The girls were killed as they were preparing to take part in a youth day program. Twenty-two other people were injured. More than 40 earlier bombings had occurred in <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> during the civil rights struggles of the late 1950s and early 1960s, but no one was killed in those. In a service that featured freedom songs of the civil rights movement, <PERSON> Arrington </PERSON>, who is in his third four-year term, said `` the torch that we raise tonight is raised by two hands _ one black and one white.'' `` We have the power to transcend that tragic event,'' he said. `` We are determined it will have a redeeming quality.'' Cross told the audience that he has never preached the sermon he prepared for the morning of the bombing, and does n't intend to. He said he had planned to tell young people at the church to `` anchor their lives to the solid Rock _ <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> _ the same yesterday, today and forever.'' A plaque in the church contains pictures of the four girls with the inscription: `` May men learn to replace bitterness and violence with love and understanding.'' All lower-level windows of the church now are covered with steel mesh, a sharp contrast to 1963, when glass shards from the windows covered virtually every square foot on the side of the building where the bomb exploded. Prior to the memorial service, black and white church congregations served food to people gathered in <LOCATION> Kelly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ingram </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, a rallying spot for civil rights marches led by the Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> in the early 1960s. Nearby is the site of a civil rights museum planned by the city under <PERSON> Arrington </PERSON>'s impetus. All visible racial barriers are gone in <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, which has six blacks and three whites on its City Council. The current pastor of the church, the Rev. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, said <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> `` has provided spiritual and moral leadership to the world for the past quarter century.'' A retired automobile mechanic and <PERSON> Ku </PERSON> <PERSON> Klux </PERSON> <PERSON> Klansman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambliss </PERSON>, was convicted in 1977 of murdering Miss <PERSON> McNair </PERSON>. He died in prison after eight years. Miss <PERSON> McNair </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> McNair </PERSON>, a former state legislator and now a <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> commissioner, said he still is not satisfied. Although segregation in politics and business has ended, it bothers him that most churches still are either white or black. `` Mankind needs the church or the synagogue,'' he said. `` This is part of man's inner being. If they ca n't come together at that time, then how are they going to come together in genuineness at any other occasion? I have to doubt it.''

 From <LOCATION> Aruba </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Zanzibar </LOCATION>, from <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>, the 1988 Olympic Games will be a television event. Pictures of the Games will be beamed from <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> to virtually every country on the globe and are expected to be seen by an estimated 80 percent of the world's population, officials of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Satellite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> said. `` With just about every country participating in the Games and picking up the feed, the summer Olympics from <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> will be the most watched event in world history,'' said <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Trujillo </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Intelsat </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Intelsat </ORGANIZATION> is a non-profit international consortium whose global satellite network will provide pictures of the Olympics to all 161 countries that will be represented at the Games in the next two weeks and several others not participating. <PERSON> Trujillo </PERSON> said nine of <ORGANIZATION> Intelsat </ORGANIZATION>'s 15 satellites will be used to carry the feeds of hundreds of broadcasting companies and organizations back to their home countries, where the pictures will distributed through domestic networks. `` We started about seven years ago planning the international coverage of the Games, shortly after the site for the'88 Games was announced,'' said <PERSON> Arnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyers </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Intelsat </ORGANIZATION>'s manager of broadcast services. And plans likely will be changing throughout the Games as broadcasters from countries whose athletes are doing better than expected request additional feeds on the satellite network, he said. The last event of such international viewing proportion was the 1984 summer Olympic Games in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, when <ORGANIZATION> Intelsat </ORGANIZATION> carried pictures of the competition on eight satellites to about 150 countries, <PERSON> Trujillo </PERSON> said. Technological advances this year will permit a transmission to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> carrying the opening and closing ceremonies in high definition television, which produces superior picture quality and sound. Japanese officials plan to use the feed to demonstrate the technology, called HDTV, at locations in about 50 cities throughout <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. HDTV broadcasts are scheduled to begin in 1990 in that country, beamed via satellite to small receiving dishes in viewers' homes All of the pictures from the 19-day competitions that are sent outside <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> will use the <ORGANIZATION> Intelsat </ORGANIZATION> network, including the pictures sent by <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>, which plans to telecast 179 -LCB- hours from <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> viewers.

<HEAD>White House Sets Out Priorities for Regulatory Changes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, claiming credit for eliminating or easing thousands of federal regulations over the past 7 -LCB- years, has 451 more `` significant'' changes it wants before leaving office. But White House officials do not expect a repeat of the flurry of new regulatory proposals that sprang from federal agencies in the last days of President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s administration in January 1981. `` You wo n't see any midnight regulations, I do n't think,'' White House Budget Director <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said Thursday. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> made the comment after unveiling a 603-page report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on the status of `` rules'' that federal agencies write and enforce for assuring everything from pizzas having enough cheese to encouraging pharmaceutical companies to come up with a vaccine for AIDS. The largest areas of anticipated regulatory activity concern environmental and work place matters, with 98 of the proposed actions in the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and 91 in the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, most of them in the <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the departments of <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> account for about 60 percent of the anticipated regulatory activity this year, the report said. Of the 451 actions listed the report by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>, 87 have congressionally or court-mandated deadlines. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> officials could not say how many would cut regulatory burdens and how many would increase them. `` Some of it is deregulatory in the clear sense, but that is a relatively small part this year,'' said <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Plager </PERSON>, the new administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs at <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION>. In an opening statement at the front of the report, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> bragged that he and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> have `` weeded out and eliminated wasteful, unnecessary and intrusive'' federal environmental, safety and other regulations costing American consumers tens of billions of dollars. Unlike a year ago when the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> report on the same topic never mentioned <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> this year shared credit with his vice president and a task force that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> chaired for eliminating `` unnecessary regulatory costs.'' `` The steady but enormous progress the vice president and I have made over the past 7 -LCB- years to improve the way government regulates has been one of our administration's proudest achievements,'' the president said. <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> officials quipped Thursday that the omission of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s name in last year's report `` probably was an oversight.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Plocher </PERSON>, an attorney for <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> Watch, a research and advocacy group that tracks the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> budget office's role in federal regulations, said most of the work by the Bush-chaired task force was accomplished between 1981 and 1983. `` It was resurrected in 1987 to give <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> something else to put on his resume,'' <PERSON> Plocher </PERSON> said, `` but there has been virtually no evidence that the resurrected task force has accomplished anything. He got the title but he actually has n't done the work.'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> acknowledged that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> task force had been relatively inactive until the past year. But he said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been the key player in making the more than 100 agencies that issue and enforce regulations carry out <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s policies. `` While <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> carries a great deal of clout,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said, `` it was really the vice president whose clout mattered in getting things done, getting agencies to turn around and look at regulatory matters in ways they had n't looked at them before.''

<HEAD>Ecologists Say `Let It Burn' Policy Is Sound</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 You do n't preserve a forest by putting out all fires, ecologists observe in defending the `` let it burn'' policy of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The forest will keep changing as plant and animal species kept down by periodic natural fires establish themselves, and, `` You're going to culminate in a few species that can out-compete the others,'' said <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Roughgarden </PERSON>, professor of biological sciences at <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> `` It must be understood that nothing is preserved by stopping burning,'' said <PERSON> Roughgarden </PERSON>, who was a member of a panel for reporters organized by the American Association for the Advancement of Science on Thursday. The panel was trying to call attention to ecology, the science that studies the relationships of organisms with their environments. Today's issue of Science, the weekly scientific journal of the association, has a special section on the subject. The word `` ecology'' is not properly a synonym for `` environment,'' <PERSON> Roughgarden </PERSON> observed at one point: `` It is not something you should be for or against. It is simply there.'' Others on the panel _ who were quick to point out they were not specialists in fire ecology _ said government agencies should not return to the days of trying to put out all fires and the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> was widely using its anti-fire cartoon symbol of Smoky the Bear. However, they said revisions in the `` let it burn'' policy might be desirable in light of the burning of half of <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> this summer. `` A backlash returning us to Smoky the Bear would be a larger disaster than the fires,'' said <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilbur </PERSON>, professor of zoology at <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` The worst possible thing that could happen would be to go back to a total fire-suppression policy,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, a research ecologist at <ORGANIZATION> Oak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. Fire suppression brings `` reduced landscape diversity, which can cause the transmission of disturbances such as fire, or a pest,'' said <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>. The loss of diversity is `` a brand-new problem ... a new area of research.'' `` There remains a good ecological basis for the plan of controlled burning'' that government agencies follow, said <PERSON> Roughgarden </PERSON>. `` Without fire you simply obtain an entirely different vegetation type.'' Though the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has been using controlled burning in some parks, it had not been used in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The carefully choreographed steps by the government and opposition toward a broad-based national dialogue represent the most significant opening in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s political impasse since the 1981 martial law crackdown. But serious obstacles remain before any ompromise can be reached that would bridge the chasm dividing Polish authorities from the East bloc's largest and best-organized opposition movement. After their second working meeting in 16 days Thursday, Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and Interior Minister Gen. <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> indicated that efforts toward round-table talks _ broad-based discussions on <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s future _ were on track. Another meeting today involves for the first time other Solidarity representatives and members of the official trade union alliance OPZZ. Opposition activists appeared satisfied that authorities are willing in principle to re-legalize Solidarity in a form yet to be negotiated. `` I would say that both sides are not terribly far apart as far as basic things are concerned,'' said pro-Solidarity journalist <PERSON> Krzysztof </PERSON> <PERSON> Sliwinski </PERSON>. What remains to be seen, he said, is how different the new Solidarity would be from the mass social movement of 1980-81. <PERSON> Ludwig </PERSON> <PERSON> Krasucki </PERSON>, an editor of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> monthly <PERSON> Nowe </PERSON> <PERSON> Drogi </PERSON>, said in an interview there was a better than 50 percent chance that union pluralism would be allowed. `` It can not be easy,'' he said. `` It needs some time. And then I think we will open a process'' of negotiation. The government overtures after seven years of deadlock comes amid signs that communist authorities are psychologically prepared to accept the permanent existence of an organized political opposition. Some officially published commentaries have even gone so far as to praise the effects of an active opposition movement. `` States having a strong political opposition keep developing, while the socialist states are sinking in crisis,'' said one particularly startling commentary in the officially published weekly Odrozenie. After struggling without marked success to govern alone, the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> -LRB- </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- Party led by Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> is hoping through round-table talks with <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> to tap the energy of the opposition that it crushed in 1981. But there is a catch: whatever formula is devised, it must somehow guarantee that the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> keeps the dominant role. Proposals have been floated in the press, such as reserving a significant minority of parliament seats for the opposition, or creating a new upper chamber of parliament with limited powers which would not have a guaranteed majority of communist deputies. But it is highly uncertain whether <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s skeptical and pragmatic opposition would ever accept anything that smacked of tokenism or being co-opted by the system. <PERSON> Krasucki </PERSON> said the majority of party membership is ready for a `` big compromise'' in political reform, and that he thought <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> would bring about the changes. But a grand old man of the Polish opposition movement, Socialist <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Lipski </PERSON>, said he was skeptical of any speedy promises of reform. `` The direction of changes will get deeper, that's for sure,'' he said. `` But it will take much more time.'' The government's decision to enter into talks, taken in the midst of last month's strikes and signs that <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s downward economic spiral is worsening, gives the appearance of a country coming full circle. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> was also in dire economic straits in 1980 when strikes lifted the then unknown <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> into the role of spokesman for an entire society's grievances. A tide of social unrest forced authorities then to deal with <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, but over the next 15 -LCB- months it was confrontation, not acceptance that characterized government actions toward the union. The December 1981 martial law crackdown was merely the final blow. Outlawing Solidarity and detaining thousands of its supporters only exacerbated the government's problems. The economy continued to falter and the government had little domestic support to draw upon when mounting foreign debt forced it into unpopular austerity measures. Solidarity in turn has been frustrated by its outlaw status, which has hampered its effectiveness as a trade union by subjecting members to legal reprisals and preventing them from working openly to organize factories. Both sides, tired and fed up with the status quo, would like to see a change. Possible outlines of a compromise emerged in the first interview with <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> published in the official Polish press since the martial law crackdown. Since authorities will not totally abandon the official trade unions set up after Solidarity, a major question is how both Solidarity and those unions can exist in the same workplaces.

 Textile-state lawmakers, racing to gain approval of their embattled import-limiting bill before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> adjourns, confess anxiety over fresh delays being threatened in the House. `` They could outdistance us, we just do n't have that much time in this Congress,'' Sen. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, said Thursday after the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved the bill 59-36 in a rerun of action it took last week. Designed to protect American industry from foreign competition, the bill won approval last week only to remain bottled up in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> when opponents seized on a technicality to delay it. Thursday's vote freed the bill from that snarl and sent it to the House. The bill would freeze textile and apparel imports at 1987 levels and limit growth to 1 percent annually starting next year. It would hold nonrubber footwear imports to 1987 levels and ban further increases in foreign producers' share of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has been fighting over new import curbs for three years, with sponsors saying they are needed to save both American jobs and an industry that is vital to the nation's defense. Critics concede apparel companies have problems but say the textile industry is flourishing. Indeed, opponents credit stepped up competition from overseas with prodding the textile industry to modernize. They attribute a wave of layoffs since the early 1980s to increased automation. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> vetoed an earlier version of the bill in 1985, saying it would narrow consumer choices and cost more jobs than it would save. The current version is moving slowly forward amid threats of another presidential veto. `` The president's going to veto it, fortunately, and I hope that we have the votes to sustain the veto,'' Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>, R-Ore., told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> `` America can not turn its back on the world. It's going to be part of it, and, frankly, I'd rather participate in it. Textile forces had hoped that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would give swift approval to the four changes that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> made since the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed the bill a year ago. But the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> voted Wednesday to negotiate the differences in a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> conference committee. `` A conference just delays the time,'' <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> complained to reporters Thursday after the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s action. The Ways and Means action Wednesday appeared to dash textile supporters' hopes that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> changes would get a stamp of approval and a quick trip to the White House. But House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said it was not certain the measure would go to a conference committee. The president can prevent a bill from becoming law when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is not in session merely by not signing it. This is called a pocket veto. Textile forces are trying to avoid one, saying it would lower the political price paid by the administration with elections coming by keeping the spotlight off the issue. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> have set an adjournment target date of Oct. 5. Avoiding a pocket veto and forcing <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to actually use his veto pen also just could give textile forces a chance to try for an override and pass the measure into law over the president's objections The bill has not demonstrated that it can gain the two-thirds support needed for an override, but <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> said that he could produce enough votes in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> if it came to a showdown. There are only four differences between the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> versions. _ The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill would freeze imports at 1986 levels and textile forces already have said they are prepared to change that to the 1987 levels specified in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version _ A provision of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill would set up a one-year pilot program under which the government would auction off import licenses to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> importing firms _ To muster farm support, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> attached a provision that would guarantee textile-exporting nations greater quotas in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market if they increased their purchases of American farm goods _ The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill would establish a special quota for imported silk neckties; the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> version has no such provision

<HEAD>Mystery Solved: The Wishbone Is a Spring</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> scientist wanting to know why birds have wishbones believes he has found the answer. `` The wishbone turns out to be a spring,'' said <PERSON> Farish </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>'s biology department. In a report published today in the journal Science, <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> described a new way of studying the inner mechanics of birds in flight by taking movies of them with X-ray cameras. And he detailed his first discovery with this tool _ the function of the wishbone. At the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION>, researcher <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Raikow </PERSON> was as impressed by the possibilities of X-ray movies as he was by their initial revelation. `` It's a pioneering new method of studying birds,'' he said. `` We can actually see the movement of the skeletal elements during flight. That's pretty exciting.'' <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> and two colleagues, <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dial </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goslow </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, took X-ray films of starlings flying in place against 20-45 mph winds in a wind tunnel. The movies allowed the scientist to look at the birds' insides and see how the various bones work during flight. Until now, researchers have tried to figure out such functions by looking at the skeletons of dead birds or the outsides of live ones. In their report, the researchers described the way the wishbone bends each time a bird flaps its wings. At rest, the upper ends of the starling's wishbone are 11 or 12 millimeters apart. But when the wings descend, that distance stretches to 18 to 20 millimeters. Just why it bends this way is not clear. <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> said the spring does n't seem to help the bird beat its wings more efficiently. Instead, he theorized that it helps the bird breathe in more air during flight so it can burn the extra energy it needs to stay aloft. When a bird breathes, air flows first into air sacs scattered throughout its body and then into its lungs. Among these sacs is one between the two arms of the wishbone. The researchers speculate that as the bird beats its wings downward, the wishbone spreads apart, opening the air sac so it fills with air. Then, on the upswing, the bird's sternum squeezes the air out again. `` What we suspect is that there is an alternating bellows mechanism drawing air in and out of the sac and possibly in and out of the lung,'' said <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>. Not all birds have wishbones _ hummingbirds and some parrots are among the exceptions _ but <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> believes that the starling's wishbone spring is typical of most feathered creatures, including the turkey Until now, scientists had assumed that the bone was simply a strut between the bird's shoulders. However, <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> conceded that the wishbone's springiness is obvious to Thanksgiving Day wish makers. `` This is well known to everybody in the world,'' he said. `` It's only scientists who discover the obvious.''

<TEXT>
 Credit-repair companies, little known before the 1980s, have increasingly become the target of law enforcement agencies because of their deceptive practices, say federal officials. The companies promise to help remove derogatory information from individuals' credit files, and charge as much as $ 2,000 for the service. Ms. <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Noonan </PERSON>, an official in the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>'s bureau of consumer protection, told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee Thursday `` it appears that a substantial segment of the industry engages in deceptive advertising and sales practices.'' <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON>, inspector-deputy assistant director of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s criminal investiative division, told the panel of a recent case involving <ORGANIZATION> Credit-Rite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Palmyra </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, which defrauded at least 9,000 consumers of $ 2.3 million in a credit-repair scheme in 15 states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. The investigation resulted in three convictions with the founder-president, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, being sentenced to seven years in prison, <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, former director of franchising, receiving a prison sentence of 15 months, and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, credit-repair manager, receiving three years probation. The clinics take advantage of the law that gives consumers the right to challenge the information about them that credit bureaus have on file. This provision requires a credit bureau to verify the information upon request, generally within 30 days. If verification is not completed on time, the disputed data must be deleted. Under the law, individuals who feel their credit records have inaccuracies can go directly to a local credit bureau and ask that they be corrected. However, accurate derogatory information can remain as part of an individual's credit history for seven years or, in the case of a bankruptcy, for 10 years. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurth </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureaus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a trade association representing over 1,200 consumer credit bureaus, said, `` The wrong being committed by credit clinics is the promise held out to intimidated consumers, that by some magic a credit clinic can accomplish things that the consumer can not accomplish and that false promises, rooted in half truths, will cost the consumer several hundred dollars or more. `` The illness of a poor credit history can only be cured by time and careful reconstruction of a consumer's payment history with creditors in the future,'' <PERSON> Kurth </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Banking consumer affairs subcommittee.

 The nation's first college croquet court will be dedicated next week to the professor who raised $ 16,000 to build it, despite what he described as <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>'s embarrassment by the playing field `` My level of enthusiasm -LRB- for the dedication ceremony -RRB- is not particularly high by this time,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> B </PERSON>. Young, a literature professor emeritus. `` The playing court has been around for months.'' The 105-by-84-foot manicured lawn is the first regulation croquet court on an American college campus. It was built last year with donations from alumnae and friends. College President <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Maples </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> will shoot the first wicket at the Sept. 24 ceremony naming the court after Young. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s team will give a demonstration of the sport, which evokes images of gentry in white dress. The field's first tournament opened to little fanfare last April at the 2,000-student school, and <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said at the time that the school was embarrassed by the court. `` I'm told that this court promotes the idea that <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> is elitist,'' he said. `` If it were n't, they'd be out of business.'' The dedication ceremony planned for that tournament was postponed because <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> was out of town, college spokeswoman <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said. She said Thursday that the ceremony was rescheduled for September because <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> `` wanted the dedication to coincide with a tournament so people could see the field being used.'' The ceremony kicks off a weekend tournament involving <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Collegiate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Croquet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> teams. The college has denied that the dedication delay had any connection to a survey that found many students and staff consider the school elitist. Young, 66, who lost one leg and suffered a crippling injury to his other foot during World War II, had given up on sports until he discovered croquet and founded the <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> team. He said he was `` of course extremely pleased by the naming of the field,'' but added: `` The timing does n't galvanize me.''

<HEAD>Cable From Jamaica: `Emergency Conditions. Total Devastation'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Television commercials still were inviting viewers to `` come back to <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>'' on Tuesday when a Madison Avenue advertising executive managed to get a telex from <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION> to his home office. `` Emergency conditions. Total devastation. ... Cancel all TV and print advertising. Appeal as a national disaster.'' Account supervisor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>'s dramatic cable to <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rubicam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> was one of the first attempts by the tourism industry to deal with the devastation wrought by <PERSON> Hurricane </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, the century's strongest storm. There were few attempts at boosterism Thursday as tourism officials attempted to assess the damage and help stranded tourists get home. Travel agents, tour operators and airline spokesmen said they were offering rebookings or refunds to anyone who had booked trips for this week or this weekend. For trips farther into the future, policies varied. A surprising number of tourists did not want to reschedule. `` It's amazing. People think the storm just came and went and not much really happened,'' said <PERSON> Sisi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gulmez </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Magnatours </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which specializes in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION>. `` Our future bookings may have slowed down but they have not stopped by any means.'' In <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, travel agency employee <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said he was holding his reservations for <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION> this Tuesday, at least for now. `` I'm thinking of just landing and see what it's like,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. `` I was thinking of doing some camping anyway.'' Despite the proliferation of television and newspaper reports from <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, tourism officials said the island remained largely cut off from the outside world. `` We have been answering questions, but it's very perplexing for us _ the frustration because we do n't know what's going on,'' said <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Munsch </PERSON>, director of operations and reservations for <ORGANIZATION> Sunburst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holidays </ORGANIZATION>, one of the major bookers of trips to <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>. Sunburst was offering refunds to anyone who had bookings for the next 10 days. <PERSON> Munsch </PERSON> said most customers with later bookings seemed to be waiting for more information before deciding whether to cancel. Still, she said, `` I'd be lying to you if I said I was n't concerned. Most of the damage so far was in <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Cayman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION>, raising the possibility that other <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> resorts could benefit from the spillover. On Thursday, for example, two cruise ships docked unexpectedly in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> harbor. But <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON> <PERSON> Yankus </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Puerto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tourist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said the organization did not want to seem to encourage such detours for fear of seeming to take advantage of others' misery. One consolation was that tourism is relatively light in September, largely because people do n't like to visit the islands during hurricane season, said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, owner of JB's World Travel Consultants in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Commercial flights out of <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> resumed Thursday on a limited basis. Only daytime flights were possible because electricity was not fully restored at either airport, said <PERSON> Dinaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Boga </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jamaica </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. There were plans for about seven flights today, she said. In <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Mexicana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Shari </PERSON> reported late Thursday she had received word there was no major damage to hotels. <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Med </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> had planes standing by waiting to carry home guests from its <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION> resort as soon as airports reopened, said <PERSON> Jean-Luc </PERSON> <PERSON> Oizan-Chapon </PERSON>, the chief operating officer. Ms. <PERSON> Shari </PERSON> said there was a chance the airport in <LOCATION> Merida </LOCATION>, about four hours by car from <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION>, could open by today. Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> did not seem to upset <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, which chose Wednesday to announce its first expansion into the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, including daily flights to <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>. The service begins Dec. 16. One man still stranded in <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> on Thursday was <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, the ad man.

 The head of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said he wo n't issue any last-minute `` midnight regulations'' as the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration comes to a close. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, in remarks to reporters Thursday, named only four major regulations he would try to complete before leaving office in January. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said he also would try to nail down arrangements for an international conference in the next administration to strengthen a treaty limiting chlorofluorocarbon emissions. `` I'm trying to make decisions that are logical and natural, not speeding it up or slowing it down,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said.

 As vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> took the stage carrying <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' message for the South, the event resembled a reunion for Democrats who once worked together and won the White House. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator was flanked by <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>'s top elected officials _ Gov. <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> McWherter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>. The audience was filled with cheering local sheriffs, school board members and party activists. `` I know what's happened the last two presidential elections,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Shelby </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> fund-raiser Thursday night. `` You've seen some of our Democratic friends go into that voting booth, pull that curtain, and vote for <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` Now, we understand that, and we respect that,'' he said, pausing before the punch line: `` But now we're saying, ` Democrats who voted for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, welcome home, welcome back to our party.''' The crowd roared. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign knows that <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> can repeat that scene in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>, and it can only hope that the effort will help score a win on Nov. 8 for the Democratic ticket. <PERSON> Tad </PERSON> <PERSON> Devine </PERSON>, who watches the polls and directs the vice presidential campaign from Dukakis-Bentsen headquarters in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, says <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is `` an effective tool'' for convincing conservative Democrats they can vote for the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor. `` I expect that he'll continue to sort of ` credential' Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> before these audiences,'' <PERSON> Devine </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` Everywhere he's been so far, he's been very well received in terms of the political impact,'' including extensive coverage and interviews with the local press. But there are doubts outside the campaign. `` ` Credentialing' is an academic approach to saying the fella ca n't stand on his own two feet,'' said <PERSON> Claibourne </PERSON> <PERSON> Darden </PERSON>, an Atlanta-based pollster and consultant whose clients include Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga. `` It's like getting a Ph.D. because you ca n't get a job. While it's smart for <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> to focus on the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> _ `` You fish where the fish bite,'' he said _ the vice presidential candidate can only open the door for the presidential candidate to walk through. `` The question is, how capable is <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> at walking through these doors in the South? The answer so far is not so good,'' <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON>, the Dukakis-Bentsen campaign's Southern regional director, said the evidence was to the contrary. In the <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> hotel ballroom, he pointed out local officials who would n't be caught near the two previous Democratic tickets `` They call them leaders, but really they tend to follow the voters,'' he said. `` They're still moving toward the ticket. They're with the ticket.'' But <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> acknowledged that <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s easy popularity with Southern Democrats who voted for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was n't enough. `` You're definitely going to see <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> follow up'' with more Southern trips himself, he said, citing the governor's previous Southern swings. `` I do n't think he -LRB- <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> -RRB- closes the deal.'' <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> declined to say which Southern states the Democrats believe they are capable of winning but <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s schedule this week follows the scenario the campaign acknowledges privately. Besides his native <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, which is a neck-and-neck battle, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was hunting for votes in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. He was in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> just last weekend. <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarrance </PERSON>, a Houston-based political consultant for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> also were states where <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> helps the Democratic ticket. `` But let's be frank _ it's <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>,'' with their 47 and 29 electoral votes, the Democrats were after, <ORGANIZATION> Tarrance </ORGANIZATION> said. And although <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> had a lot of pride tied up in the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> race, `` <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> is the one that really hurts the Republicans if it goes to the Democrats,'' he said. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> helped in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in areas where <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was weak, he said. The deep South, especially states such as <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, was very unlikely to produce a win for the Democrats. `` The South because of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> presidency is very strong for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' Tarrance said, and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s strength was more to the West in oil-producing areas. <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> said it was too early to write off any state, although he said obviously some were tougher for the Democrats than others. For cautious Southerners, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s choice for his running mate, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, presented problems for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> and an opening for <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, he said. `` You can say ` President <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>' in a room full of people and you get a combination of laughter and look of fear,'' he said. `` Every so often, the vice president tragically has to take that office.'' <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> said that while <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was unquestionably not as palatable a vice presidential candidate to Southerners as <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, he doubted the Texan's presence was having a major impact. He said people also tended to overestimate the impact of having locally-elected officials back the ticket. `` A lot of people overplay the importance of the establishment,'' he said. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> `` appeals to that upper middle class Southern white, and it's hard to peel off that vote from a Republican.'' <PERSON> Devine </PERSON> said he expected <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> to continue to focus on <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and the South and <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>. `` He's not going to just campaign in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, however,'' he said. Trips elsewhere `` reinforce his standing as a national candidate'' and that plays well in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and elsewhere, he said.

 As <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said, it was just `` a simple, 14-course picnic supper'' as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> played host for a congressional barbecue laced with tart lyrics by a troupe of former <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> aides. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, the Democrat from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state who is <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> majority leader, traded pleasantries with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at the conclusion of the annual event on the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> lawn Thursday, which will be the last for the president and first lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. As lawmakers and administration officials dined on food from four tents _ giving them their choice of seafood, Cajun, Western or Mexican cuisine _ entertainnment was provided by the Capitol Steps, a group formed six years ago at a Capitol Christmas party. The Reagans joined in the applause as the Steps aimed their satire both at the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The president laughed heartily, for instance, as a member of the troupe impersonating the Republican presidential nominee, who has been charting an increasingly independent course, sang: `` I sorta ... kinda ... remotely ... `` Distantly wan na be like you.'' In another skit, a singer representing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sang to the tune of `` September Song'': `` Try to remember `` That date in September `` The day <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> `` Attacked <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>.'' The audience erupted in laughter at the reference to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s speech at an American Legion convention in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> on Sept. 7, in which he said that that day, instead of Dec. 7, was the anniversary of the attack that plunged the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> into World War II Democratic nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did not get off scot free, either, as the singers hymned a presidential campaign pitting the `` Duke of Dullness'' against `` Sir <PERSON> George </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> even burst into laughter at what was probably the harshest satire of the evening, one in which he was represented as musing upon his place in history and intoning: `` Well ... `` Do n't know much about history `` Do n't know much about geography `` Do n't know much about World War II `` Do n't know much about who fought who `` But I know it followed World War I `` If we only fought in the wars we won `` What a wonderful world this would be.'' In his concluding remarks, the president said, `` I want to thank the Capitol Steps for showing such _ mercy. Now you're all under arrest.'' Noting that it would be the last such affair he would host, the president said, `` After 6 o'clock, we all take off the cleats and come together as friends and colleagues.'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> told the president, `` Unanimously, we wish you and Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> thanks, first of all for your many courtesies, and secondly, as you go in, not to a retirement but a different part of your life in which I know you'll be concerned as you have been for the future of this country and for its role in the world, the best of every happiness, success and satisfaction.''

 The first American tourists back from <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> since it was overrun by Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> were thankful to escape though they conceded they got out relatively unscathed. `` The tourists were much more fortunate than most of the Jamaicans,'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> McKenney </PERSON> said Thursday after clearing customs at <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. `` There are some people there who have n't had food or water for several days. But most hotels took care of their guests.'' `` The worst part was not being able to contact anyone to let them know how you were,'' said the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Smyrna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> resident's wife, <PERSON> Joanna </PERSON> With their luggage, passengers arriving here brought tales of devastation in the villages and inconveniences in the resorts. `` There were no lights, no running water,'' said <PERSON> Eileen </PERSON> <PERSON> Veskey </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, who stayed in her 14th-floor <LOCATION> Montego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> hotel room as the hurricane blew through the island Monday. `` We were going to the pools for water to flush the toilets.'' But tourists who arrived here Thursday on an <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight said few hotels or resorts were without some drinking water or food. As the Miami-bound plane lifted off the <LOCATION> Montego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> runway, cheers rang out, and when it landed here, tourists were still celebrating. `` We're home,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Paulette </PERSON> <PERSON> Roy </PERSON>, 65, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` Oh yes, we're very happy to be back.'' <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, one of the century's strongest hurricanes, passed over <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> with 175-mph winds that destroyed homes and farms and cut off electricity and communication throughout the island, where at least 26 people were killed. The <LOCATION> Montego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> airport reopened Thursday. `` The island is still in pretty bad shape,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Cullipher </PERSON>, one of 44 <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> travel agents who had been trapped in <LOCATION> Montego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> by the storm. `` It seems we wo n't be sending people to <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> for a while.'' But in the <LOCATION> Cayman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Bodden </PERSON>, the tourism minister, said visitors can begin returning to the three-island chain that was spared serious damage from <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>. Resorts and most of the homes on the islands received only minor damage, he said. `` Things should be back to almost normal for visitors by Monday or Tuesday,'' <PERSON> Bodden </PERSON> said at a news conference. He flew to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> after waiting out the hurricane in the <ORGANIZATION> Caymans </ORGANIZATION>. He said government officials next week will examine whether the hurricane damaged the islands' reefs, one of the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>'s most popular diving spots. <PERSON> Bodden </PERSON> estimated tourism, the country's biggest industry, brings about $ 145 million annually

 Here is the 228-182 roll call Thursday by which the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> deleted from a drug bill a provision requiring a seven-day waiting period for the purchase of handguns, substituting instead a vaguely defined system for identifying convicted felons seeking to buy handguns. A `` yes'' vote is a vote to eliminate the waiting period from the bill. Voting yes were 101 Democrats and 127 Republicans. Voting no were 137 Democrats and 45 Republicans. X denotes those not voting. Present denotes those who voted they were `` present'' at the time of the vote but did not vote `` yes'' or `` no'' on the issue. There are three vacancies in the 435-member House.

<HEAD>Emergency Planners Step Up Preparations For Gilbert</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Federal emergency planners say they've moved into high gear in preparing to help remedy whatever damage is inflicted on south <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> by Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>. Trucks, equipment and personnel were readied Thursday for quick dispatch to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> as <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, with maximum sustained winds of 120 mph, marched on across the Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. `` We are bringing every resource we have up to maximum operational capability in preparedness of relocating and mitigating this problem,'' said <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>, in charge of the natural disaster program at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said aircraft at naval air stations all along the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> coastline were dispatched to a civilian airport in <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Sheppard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Biggs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airfield </ORGANIZATION>, all in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> personnel and dependents were sent to <ORGANIZATION> Lackland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, 130 miles inland. Naval ships in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> were sent out to sea to avoid the storm. Army Maj. Gen. <PERSON> J.D </PERSON>. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said procedures were streamlined to ensure `` this is not a bureaucratic slow-moving turtle.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> agreed to dispatch active duty military personnel to back up the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> National Guard if necessary. `` I think it is fair to say that we recognize that we face the greatest weather threat that we have ever faced in our part of the country. We want to be certain our preparation is up to the challenge,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> said paperwork had already been prepared to allow President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to almost immediately issue a disaster declaration and set relief efforts in motion, cutting through the five to seven days usually needed. <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> said federal agencies would dispatch Spanish-speaking personnel and Spanish-language forms and pamphlets to help communication with the sizeable Hispanic population along the coast. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> said it also had begun sending emergency supplies to four hurricane `` watch'' districts at several <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> cities. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> said thousands of blankets, cots, comfort kits and cleanup kits were on their way to <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Beaumont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. In addition, volunteers and staff members were sent to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, staging areas for deployment after the storm hits.

<HEAD>Reagan Expected To Sign Spy Satellite Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is expected to sign a bill to modernize the nation's spy satellite network as part of intelligence agency activities over the coming year,. Precise provisions of the measure, which was approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday, have not been revealed. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved by voice vote a compromise measure which the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had passed a day earlier. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> initiated the major modernization program for electronic spying after concluding that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> photo and eavesdropping satellites are growing outmoded. The nation's spy capabilities in space have not been substantially updated in a decade. In reviewing how well the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could verify Soviet compliance with the new Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces, or INF, treaty, the panel found that monitoring technology would be inadequate if the superpowers reach later agreement on deep cuts in long-range nuclear weapons. A compromise was reached with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration on the amount of money needed for the program, but it was uncertain whether <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will appropriate the funds. That issue is tied up in a dispute over a separate Pentagon appropriations bill. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> opposes the initiative, saying it has been too hastily conceived and would not substantially enhance <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> treaty-monitoring ability. The exact amounts for the spy satellite program and the overall intelligence budget are secret, but total spending on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence programs reportedly is approximately $ 25 billion. Nearly all of the money is hidden in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s budget. Among other provisions in the intelligence bill: _ Stronger language prohibiting the government from aiding <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Contra rebels unless specifically authorized by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> The issue became controversial during the Iran-Contra affair when the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration insisted prohibitions on intelligence agencies aiding the rebels did not extend to the president's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> staff. The new legislation bars any `` entity'' of the government from unauthoried aid to the Contras, which would include the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION>. _ A requirement that the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about the activities of the agency's internal inspector general, who investigates allegations of wrongdoing The provision also would require the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director to tell congressional overseers any time he bars the inspector general from undertaking a specific investigation. The only dollar amounts mentioned in the unclassified version of the intelligence bill were a $ 23.7 million authorization for the 244-member intelligence community staff, which serves the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director in his role of coordinator of all government intelligence activities; $ 15.1 million for <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> counterintelligence activities in keeping tabs on Soviet inspectors at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> weapons sites under the INF treaty; and $ 144.5 million for the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>'s retirement and disability fund.

 They were told to bring their own food, drinks and blankets, but warned to leave their pets, booze and guns at home. And they did. As Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, perhaps the most-feared storm of its kind, approached the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> coast, residents fled their homes, taking bedrolls and food supplies to <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> shelters on higher ground. In this southernmost <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> city, where the eye of <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> was predicted to pass sometime this evening, 750 people filled the civic auditorium to its capacity within four hours, while hundreds of others crowded into schools. For some, their flight to the shelters was reminiscent of Hurricane Beulah, which struck <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> in 1980 and Hurricane Allen, which landed north of <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> the same year. `` We brought food, water, some milk, but my husband forgot the stereo and all our medicine, but I think we will be all right,'' said 77-year-old <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>, a diabetic in a wheelchair. Families staked out perimeters on the floor of the civic center, placing blankets, sheets and pillows on the floor next to bags of food and ice chests filled with meats and soft drinks. Some children brought their plastic toys and some brought their teddy bears while others turned on their small radios and tuned in to news of the storm. `` Most of the people who come here or to other shelters in the -LRB- <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> -RRB- <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> are those who do n't have transportation to go north,'' said <PERSON> Ersel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantz </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> effort at the civic center. `` We have all kinds of people here, from those that need Pampers, to those that need wheelchairs,'' he said. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, 19, said he boarded up the home of mother and grandparents in nearby <LOCATION> Olmito </LOCATION> and drove them to the civic center. `` We just decided this was the best place to be because of all the predictions of damage it could cause,'' <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Elena </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>, 34, brought her children to the shelter because she feared staying in her second-story apartment. `` We know that there might be an emergency and we do n't have a car and we knew we could come here where there are a lot of people and if something happened, we knew we could get something if we needed it,'' Ms. <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> <PERSON> Saldierna </PERSON>, 7, said would rather be at home. `` I think this hurricane is very bad because it could hurt somebody, especially some kids like me,'' he said. `` I wish we were in school now and I wish we were back in our own house.''

<HEAD>Two Losing Candidates Get Seats In Parliament</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KENNETH L. WHITING</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SINGAPORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Only one opposition candidate was elected earlier this month, but two of the losers will be appointed to join him in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> under a controversial measure designed to ensure opposing voices are heard. The measure, whereby the two members will get `` non-constituency'' seats, was introduced before the last polls in 1984 by amending the constitution to create limited opposition, after the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> won every seat in the four previous general elections. The <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> has been in power since 1959 under Prime Minister <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yew </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said that in two years of Cabinet discussion such alternatives as proportional representation and a second chamber in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> were considered and rejected as unsuitable for this island republic of 2.6 million people. Opposition politicians condemned the new measure as a means of perpetuating <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> rule. <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> See </PERSON> <PERSON> Tong </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Singapore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was the only opposition candidate to win at the polls on Sept. 3. The <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> took 80 of 81 seats _ 11 of them unopposed _ and 64.6 percent of the valid votes cast. <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON>, who was first elected in 1984, repeated his rejection of non-constituency seats Sunday. According to the measure, the seats are offered to the three best performers among the opposition losers. If one or two opposition candidates manage to win at the polls, as <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> did, extra seats are added up to a total of three. Those appointed must have polled at least 15 percent of the vote in their constituencies and must belong to a political party. They enjoy most of the rights and privileges of the other 81 <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> members and can speak on any issue. But they can not vote on no-confidence motions, proposals to amend the constitution or bills to supply funds to the government or tax money from the people. They represent no constituency. Opposition parties rejected the one appointment offered after the 1984 election when <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> and Workers' Party leader <PERSON> J.B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeyaretnam </PERSON> were voted into Parliament. <PERSON> Jeyaretnam </PERSON> denounced the measure then as `` a ruse to try to keep the electorate thinking of the <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> as the only government, providing for everything, including opposition MPs.'' <PERSON> Jeyaretnam </PERSON> still heads the Workers' Party but was ousted from <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and disqualified for five years from 1986 for allegedly falsifying party records. After a week of heated intra-party debate, <PERSON> Jeyaretnam </PERSON> announced Saturday that two of its losers would accept the offer to enter Parliament. If he had said no, seats would have been offered to the next two highest-polling losers. <PERSON> Jeyaretnam </PERSON> said his party remained opposed to the concept of non-constituency seats and its acceptance of them should not `` be regarded as a precedent for the party's decision in future cases.'' The Workers' Party will be represented by lawyer <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Seow </PERSON> and a physician, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Siew </PERSON> <PERSON> Choh </PERSON>. <PERSON> Seow </PERSON>, 59, a former solicitor general and president of the <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, is a newcomer to party politics and was widely expected to run as an independent. He was released on July 16 after 72 days in jail under the country's Internal Security Act, which permits detention without trial. The government alleged that <PERSON> Seow </PERSON> conspired with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats to increase the parliamentary opposition to the government. However, he has since been accused of income tax evasion and faces trial in December. If convicted, <PERSON> Seow </PERSON> would lose his <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> seat.

<HEAD>New Warhol Jewel Cache Discovered in Hidden File Drawers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A year-and-a-half after his death, <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> has sprung another surprise: hundreds of diamonds, sapphires and other jewelry worth $ 1.2 million and found hidden in a file cabinet. Curators uncovered the secret cache at the artist's <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> townhouse, <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s announced Thursday. The value of the jewelry was put at $ 1.2 million. But as last spring's auction proved, anything associated with <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> is likely to sell for far more than its book value. <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s said two curators were moving file cabinets at the townhouse in June when they discovered the jewels stashed in false-bottom drawers. The find included hundreds of diamonds, dozens of sapphires and a 300-carat emerald, <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s said. There also were 96 watches by such makers as Patek <PERSON> Philippe </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rolex </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Cartier </ORGANIZATION>. The jewelry will be auctioned Dec. 4, with proceeds going to the <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> Foundation. At the earlier auction, jewelry that had been valued at approximately $ 500,000 brought in $ 1.9 million as a frenzy of Warholmania sent prices of his art and belongings soaring. The flat file cabinets with the jewels had been used by <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> to store unframed drawings and prints. They had been examined before last spring's auction, but no one noticed the hollow bottoms, <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s spokesman <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Weigman </PERSON> said. The curators discovered the false bottoms only after they removed the bottom drawers to lighten the cabinets before moving them, he said. <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> died in February 1987 at age 58.

 Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>'s growth from a harmless low pressure zone off <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to a ferocious killer in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> was fueled by a combination of heat, moisture and wind that baffles forecasters. `` It's a matter of getting everything together in the right place in the right time,'' <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hurricane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. `` It does n't happen very often. How it develops, we do n't know.'' <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> came to the attention of center forecasters Sept. 3 as a dry low pressure trough moving west out of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` We get 50 or 60 of these off <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> every summer. About one of six develop,'' said <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>. By Sept. 8, the system became a depression. It reached tropical storm status by Saturday and a hurricane Sunday. A tropical wave becomes a depression when winds start swirling. When sustained winds reach 39 mph, the system becomes a named tropical storm. It reaches hurricane status when sustained winds hit 74 mph. Why <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> organized and strengthened while other systems did n't `` is a mystery more or less,'' said <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> meteorology Professor <PERSON> Rainer </PERSON> <PERSON> Bleck </PERSON>. `` The first part of the summer we were biting our nails, wondering why these -LRB- other -RRB- disturbances did n't develop,'' he said Thursday. `` That's something meteorologists would like to know more about.'' But the scientists do know what fuels a budding storm once development begins. And they know that development is sparked when winds converge, and that growth is affected by time and place. `` If that happens in an area where there's plenty of moisture in the lower atmosphere -LRB- the bottom 10,000 feet or so -RRB-, this convergence may lead to upward motion and cloud formation,'' <PERSON> Bleck </PERSON> said. `` If clouds form, the heat of condensation in the clouds occasionally provides ` positive feedback' to the convergence pattern. That strengthens it,'' he said, adding that storms can begin budding only off the equator because of the Earth's rotation. Eventually, a vortex is created. `` Any time you contract an air mass, they will start spinning. That's what makes the tornadoes, hurricanes and blizzards, those winter storms,'' <PERSON> Bleck </PERSON> said. Hurricanes `` are useful to the climate machine. Their primary role is to transport heat from the lower to the upper atmosphere,'' he said. `` The sun puts energy into the water, the top of the oceans and lowest part of the atmosphere. That has to be distributed from the bottom to higher levels of the atmosphere.'' When the depression that would become <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> neared <LOCATION> Barbados </LOCATION>, warm <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> waters nurtured it. `` This time of year in the northwest <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> is best for development,'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. `` If you get a storm in this area in September, when the water's warmest, it can just explode. This is where <PERSON> Camille </PERSON> formed and exploded,'' referring to the 1969 storm that slammed into the Gulf Coast. `` It is an exciting thing to watch. If you're on the beach watching the storm surge, it's a different story,'' he said. The hurricane center said <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> was the most intense storm on record in terms of barometric pressure, measured at 26.13 inches Tuesday night. That broke the 26.35 inches of the 1935 hurricane that devastated the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION>.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON> ordered police to ensure that gasoline stations and stores open today after <PERSON> Hurricane </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> pounded the island, killing at least 26 people and leaving 500,000 homeless. <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON> declared much of the island a disaster area Thursday night and invoked special emergency powers to push forward with an enormous cleanup effort. The powers allow the government to requisition private vehicles and heavy equipment to distribute vital supplies to the hardest hit areas. `` The purpose of this period of public emergency is to ensure the restoration of normality as quickly as possible in the most affected areas,'' <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON> said in a nationwide radio broadcast. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> pounded into <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>'s east coast Monday, its 145 mph winds smashing the length of the island, severely damaging or destroying 80 percent of the country's 500,000 homes. <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON> estimated damage at $ 8 billion, and officials estimated the death toll could rise when they regain communications with the interior. Five people were reported killed in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> and 10 in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, where the military government declared its own state of emergency on the southern peninsula. The disaster area contains more than 1 million of this <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> island nation's 2.3 million people and embraces four of <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>'s 14 parishes, or counties, on the badly hit east coast _ <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andrew </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Catherine </LOCATION> and <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON> also authorized the police to see that gasoline stations and stores selling food, hardware, drugs and fuel were opened for business by 8 a.m. today. Even before <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON>'s action, people were on the move, cleaning up the damage. Telephone crews replaced snapped utility poles and set up hundreds more that had lain toppled alongside or across just about every street in <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION>, the capital. Phone service was re-established by midmorning in the <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION> area, though lines destroyed in the island's eastern region were expected to take months to replace. The Jamaican <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, police, firefighters and rescue crews were joined by thousands of volunteers in clearing streets and sidewalks of debris _ trees, rocks, glass shards, bricks, pieces of smashed furniture. Hundreds of foreign tourists stranded on the island by <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> filled <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION>'s battered <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> <PERSON> Airport </PERSON> as commercial flights resumed. At <LOCATION> Montego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> on the island's north side, the international airport also resumed service. The prime minister appeared to acknowledge the volunteer spirit, saying `` I expect full cooperation from the public so that none of the emergency powers will have to be used. With full cooperation, I expect that the period of public emergency will be brief.'' <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON> said the government's top priorities are to provide shelter for the homeless and assure adequate food supplies. Few downtown <ORGANIZATION> Kingston </ORGANIZATION> buildings escaped unscathed. The National Gallery's windows were blown out, exposing paintings to passers-by on the street. `` People are trying to do what they can do,'' said <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION> taxi driver <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Alice </PERSON>. `` They're trying to get some food and trying to get some shelter.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> Pegasus </ORGANIZATION>, one of <ORGANIZATION> Kingston </ORGANIZATION>'s luxury hotels, workers fished deck chairs and tables from a swimming pool, while another crew cleared the smashed remnants of its mammoth satellite dish. Nearby, two regulars determined to resume their daily routine cleared away the blown-out roof of the hotel tennis clubhouse and played three quick sets. With electricity still out Thursday night, stranded tourists in <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION> sat in muggy, candlelit bars, sipping warm drinks and beer. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> strengthened from a tropical storm into a hurricane Saturday night 160 miles south of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. It skirted the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> on Sunday, plowed straight through <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> on Monday, brushed past the <LOCATION> Cayman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> Tuesday and slammed into the <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> Wednesday morning. The hurricane today headed toward northern <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and southeastern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.

 When Republican vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told reporters he `` did n't live in this century,'' some thought for a moment they really had a scoop. But it was just the latest example of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s occasional tendency to garble his words when, as is his wont, he speaks extemporaneously rather than from a written text. On Thursday, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> got wrapped up at a news conference in a question about the Holocaust. What was his opinion of that time, in which six million Jews were executed under <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>, he was asked. `` It was an obscene period in our nation's history,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> replied. When a reporter suggested that perhaps he had not meant to say `` our nation's,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> tried to explain that he had meant `` in this century's history.'' `` We all lived in this century _ I did n't live in this century _ in this century's history,'' he said. `` We did not have _ as a matter of fact, we fought _ Hitlerism. The Holocaust is a critical point in history that we should as a nation understand.'' History lessons notwithstanding, reporters following the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator have long observed his propensity for malapropism. Last week in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told his audience that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s day care proposals would give parents more freedom in determining what kind of care their children would have. The result, he intended to say, would promote a better parent-child relationship. This is what came out: `` We understand the importance of having the bondage between the parent and the child.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s aides say the senator's verbal stumbling is not a major campaign concern. `` Not everybody has a golden tongue. Everybody makes mistakes from time to time,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Prosperi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s press secretary. Such instances usually occur when <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is not speaking from a prepared text. In fact, he is known to be much more comfortable speaking extemporaneously, with only a few notecards as a prop. But last week, when he discarded his prepared text on defense issues in a speech before a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> audience, out came a confusing paraphrase of <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> basketball coach <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Knight </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> told me this: ` there is nothing that a good defense can not beat a better offense.' In other words, a good offense wins,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. And on Thursday, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> responded to a question about negative campaigning by saying it was `` an unfortunate aspect as the campaign unravels.'' <PERSON> Prosperi </PERSON> noted that misspeak has plagued a number of candidates this season, such as when Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' inadvertently referred the other day to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s `` terrorism'' instead of `` patriotism.'' `` If malapropism were a liability,'' <PERSON> Prosperi </PERSON> said, `` there would be no politicians left to run for office.''

 The U.S.-backed <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> rebels accepted a government proposal to hold a preliminary meeting next week that could lead to high-level talks on ending the 7-year-old civil war. <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrey </PERSON>, one of seven Contra board members, said Thursday in a telephone interview that the rebels would go to <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> Monday to `` discuss the possiblity'' of resuming cease-fire talks. The leftist Sandinistas and the Contras signed an agreement March 23 to seek a negotiated settlement to the fighting, which has caused more than 28,000 deaths. But the talks broke off June 9, and each side accuses the other of cease-fire violations. <PERSON> Ferrey </PERSON> said the decision to hold the preliminary meeting proposed by the government did not mean the high-level summit would be renewed. `` We are not going to negotiate anything,'' he said. `` It's a contact to see if we can overcome obstacles.'' For example, he said, further high-level talks can not be held unless political opposition figures are released from prison. Sandinista police arrested more than 40 opposition figures July 10 after an anti-government demonstration in the southern city of <LOCATION> Nandaime </LOCATION>. The agreement to seek a negotiated settlement came three weeks after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> cut off all military aid to the rebels. The pact surprised <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and caused deep division among the rebels. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official on Thursday endorsed the Contras' acceptance of the Sandinista offer `` They are asking the Sandinistas to be reasonable,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Administration has backed the Contra rebels since 1981 in their fight to oust the Sandinista government. The Sandinistas came to power in 1979 in a popular revolutionary war that deposed the dictatorship of <PERSON> Anastacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>.

 Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> has similarities to <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, which had winds up to 200 mph but diminished before it reached the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> coastline in 1980, meteorologists say. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> caused heavy flooding and two deaths, but its assault on <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> in August 1980 was far less serious than had been feared. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> _ one of the most powerful hurricanes then on record _ slammed across the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> with lethal force and built to Category 5 strength. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> also built to the same strength before weakening as it passed over <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, with a diameter of more than 600 miles, rapidly built in intensity and crossed the gulf on Aug. 7 with winds near 200 mph. It sent hundreds of thousands of people on an exodus from the coast but its rush toward land suddenly stalled as a high-pressure ridge fended it off. By the time <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> crashed into the coast early Aug. 10, its winds had diminished to around 100 mph and it was classified as a Category 3 hurricane. At least 67 people were reported killed in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> after <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> raced over the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Hispaniola </LOCATION>.

 A man was convicted of criminally negligent homicide for smashing his car into a limousine during a drag race, killing a newlywed couple and the best man, but the victims' families found slim solace in the verdict `` I just want him to pay for my pain,'' 22-year-old <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Zagorski </PERSON> said Thursday after the <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jury convicted 21-year-old <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Laezza </PERSON>. Miss <PERSON> Zagorski </PERSON> was the maid of honor for her sister, 24-year-old <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Zagorski-Phillips </PERSON>, who died after 18 days in a coma. The April 1987 crash left Miss <PERSON> Zagorski </PERSON> with a permanent limp. `` My body is scarred and I want him to be scarred for the rest of his life,'' she said, tears running down her face outside the courthouse. <PERSON> Laezza </PERSON>, who was free on $ 75,000 bail, was handcuffed and remanded as his parents looked on with tears in their eyes. He could be sentenced to a maximum 19 years in prison. Sentencing is scheduled for Oct. 14. Police said <PERSON> Laezza </PERSON> was apparently drag racing at speeds up to 100 mph when his car crashed broadside into the limousine as it was turning into a catering hall parking lot for the wedding reception. Killed instantly was the groom, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, 27, and his brother and best man, 29-year-old <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>. <PERSON> Laezza </PERSON> was convicted of criminally negligent homicide but acquitted of the more serious charge of manslaughter. He also was convicted of one count of assault for seriously injuring Miss <PERSON> Zagorski </PERSON> and was acquitted of assault in connection with the limousine driver's injuries. `` This is really nothing but a terrible, terrible auto accident,'' said <PERSON> Laezza </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaffer </PERSON>. `` It was not a crime.'' <PERSON> Laezza </PERSON>, a carpenter from the <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> community of <PERSON> Selden </PERSON>, testified during the two-week trial that he did not remember the accident: His only recollection was stopping for a red light and waking up three days later in a hospital. The defense blamed the limousine driver, who suffered minor injuries in the accident, charging he caused the accident by cutting across <PERSON> Laezza </PERSON>'s lane. The verdict was returned on what would have been the groom's 29th birthday `` No matter what they do to -LRB- <PERSON> Laezza </PERSON> -RRB- it is not going to bring those kids back,'' said the groom's father, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>. `` I've been waiting 17 months to see him led away in handcuffs.

<HEAD>Aquino Hails Formation of Pro-Government Party</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> today hailed the formation of a new political party organized by her supporters but said the move must not divide democratic forces into `` permanent hostile camps.'' Formation of the new party is the latest step in a realignment of forces which ousted leader <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> in February 1986 and swept Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> into power. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> made her remarks in a speech to the opening session of the first national convention of the new party, the `` Struggle of the Democratic Filipino.'' Rep. <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitra </PERSON>, speaker of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>, was elected president of the party, which organizers hope will bring together pro-government forces under a single banner and serve as the president's own party. But some pro-Aquino politicians have attacked the new party as a bid by the president's relatives and others to consolidate their own power in advance of the 1992 presidential election. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, who has vowed not to seek re-election, told the 5,093 delegates she hoped the new party was founded `` not only for the 1992 elections but to help our people face and overcome their problems.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> acknowledged the country must reinforce its newly won democracy by establishing disciplined national parties. Parties here have traditionally formed around personalities of their leaders rather than ideology. `` Without the organization of political beliefs and programs into disciplined parties, we would have only a riot of conflicting opinions but no effective action,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said. She said political factionalism enabled her ousted predecessor, <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, to impose eight years of martial law in 1972. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said the current political realignment was creating disenchantment among the Filipino public, who fear a return to the old-style politics of bickering and infighting that led to martial rule. Delegates to the inaugural convention included 108 of the 202 members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>, six of the 23 senators, 42 provincial governors and more than 1,170 city and town mayors. Sen. <PERSON> Neptali </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, convention chairman, said he was not disappointed by Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s reluctance to give the party a ringing endorsement or to join its ranks. `` You do n't expect the president to say, ` this is my party,'' <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said. `` I think her presence here is enough inspiration to add membership to the party.'' <PERSON> Mitra </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> avoided a clearcut endorsement of the party as the principal administration party because `` she might be accused of playing politics.'' He told reporters the party was organized to consolidate political support for the government and establish a grass-roots, mass movement behind Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. `` But there are others who do not believe in this thinking,'' <PERSON> Mitra </PERSON> said. He was referring to the refusal of 18 <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to join the new party. The Liberals, led by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Jovito </PERSON> <PERSON> Salonga </PERSON>, are among six parties united in the government coalition. But the Liberals have disagreed with other pro-government parties and with some of the president's politically influential relatives. Last month, Vice President <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Laurel </LOCATION> and opposition Sen. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> announced formation of a new opposition party. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> ran under <ORGANIZATION> Laurel </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> in the 1986 presidential election, but the two fell out over differences in philosophy and personal rivalry.

<HEAD>Many Doctors Misinform Patients In Nicotine Gum Use</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM C. HIDLAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Doctors often incorrectly instruct patients on using nicotine gum or fail to prescribe it at all even though it can help heavy smokers quit, according to studies published today. `` Most internists prescribe nicotine gum to fewer than 25 percent of patients who try to quit smoking,'' said one of five smoking-related studies in today's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` There is a widespread need for physician education about how to use nicotine gum more effectively.'' For instance, nearly 40 percent of 208 internists surveyed in the study said they would prescribe nicotine gum to help patients cut down on smoking, violating a key guideline for using it. The manufacturer's guidelines call for patients to stop smoking completely before using it. And one-fourth of the internists surveyed said they had recently prescribed sedatives to help patients stop smoking, although `` there is no evidence that sedatives are useful'' for that purpose, said the study by Dr. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cummings </PERSON> and colleagues at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` I would guess that the confusion and difficulties with using the gum are very widespread,'' <PERSON> Cummings </PERSON> said. Nicotine gum, a prescription drug marketed under the trade name Nicorette by <ORGANIZATION> Lakeside </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceuticals </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, can be an effective tool to help some people quit smoking, particularly heavy smokers, concluded three other studies in the journal. But one study found that 34 of 538 patients, or 6.8 percent, who were given nicotine gum to help them quit smoking were still chewing it after a year. Those long-term gum chewers also represented 25 percent of the patients who succeeded in staying off cigarettes for a year, said the report by researchers at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION>. `` I do n't think physicians ought to supply it just willy-nilly,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fortmann </PERSON>, an assistant professor at the <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>. `` Most people who've quit smoking did it before the gum was available ... So we're by no means advocating it. `` The gum should n't be seen as either a miracle or as a necessity, but as a useful adjunct.'' Another study in the journal found that heavy smokers _ those who consume more than 25 cigarettes daily _ are more physically addicted to nicotine and have a harder time quitting than people who smoke no more than 15 cigarettes a day. That study suggested nicotine gum might better help heavy smokers overcome withdrawal symptoms caused by their physical addiction when they stop. Lakeside spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> said the manufacturer estimates 2 million people have quit smoking by using nicotine gum as part of a stop-smoking program since Nicorette was introduced in 1985. He said the company had no reports of patients becoming addicted to nicotine from the gum itself. Any dependence on the gum `` is a transference'' of the patient's nicotine addiction from smoking and `` is part of the weaning process,'' <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> said.

 The dollar held its ground against the Japanese yen today, while share prices on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> rose moderately. The dollar closed 0.31 yen higher at 133.76 yen. It opened at 133.65 yen and fluctuated in a narrow range of 133.58-133 .80 yen Spot volume was estimated at $ 4 billion amid directionless trading. `` Because the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> market opened at almost the same level as it closed before the release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures and a Japanese national holiday Thursday, it was difficult for investors to figure out whether they should sell or buy the dollar,'' said a dealer at the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity. Monthly trade data released in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Wednesday showed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit in July shrank to $ 9.53 billion from $ 13.22 billion in June, the biggest monthly improvement in almost six years. On the stock exchange, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues closed higher at 27,866.38 points, up 60.71 points or 0.22 percent from Wednesday's close of 27,805.67.

 <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Eber </PERSON> says her children and grandchildren respect her strong views but they do n't want to see her go to prison, even though that's where the 63-year-old activist may be headed. `` They wish it was somebody else doing it but me,'' the suburban <LOCATION> Villa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> mother of four and grandmother of 11 said Thursday. Ms. <PERSON> Eber </PERSON> faces six months and 3 -LCB- years in prison for her part in the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> Peace Planting, in which she and 13 others entered 10 missile sites and planted flowers or trees. `` It was the first time I saw a missile silo and it was devastating,'' Ms. <PERSON> Eber </PERSON> said, recalling her first protest Aug. 15 out on the grassy plains. `` To me it looked like a monster.'' After writing peace slogans with her own blood on the silo cover, Ms. <PERSON> Eber </PERSON> said, she sat down and waited nearly two hours for police. For her trouble, she was given a `` ban and bar letter,'' which forbade her to enter missile sites again. But she and some others went back _ three times during the next two weeks. And for that, Ms. <PERSON> Eber </PERSON> is scheduled to be tried Oct. 24 in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on four counts each of criminal trespass and damage of property less than $ 100. `` All I did was cut the padlock,'' she said. `` It ca n't be worth more than 50 cents.'' Ms. <PERSON> Eber </PERSON>, whose husband died two years ago, began her activism in the wake of the civil rights movement, when her youngest son started high school in 1967. She began tutoring children in an inner city parish, and then started a program in which high school students from the suburbs came into the city to tutor. But she felt her efforts were not changing very much, and that she needed to concentrate on changing the system itself. So she began civil disobedience, and was arrested four times in 1983 for demonstrating at the plants of several local defense contractors. For that, she said, she got 30 days of court-ordered supervision. `` It really did n't mean much,'' she said. Now, unless the charges against her are reduced, she faces a mandatory minimum sentence of six months in jail if she is convicted. And she expects a conviction. Her son <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Eber </PERSON>, 46, supports his mother in her activism but does n't entirely agree with her goals of nuclear disarmament. He said he has come to realize that `` it's more than a possibility'' his mother might go to prison. His four children, ages 16 to 25, also are worried but they respect the fact that she's willing to stand up for her beliefs, <PERSON> Eber </PERSON> said. `` I try and make a lesson about it that all we can do is be true to ourselves,'' he said. `` Sometimes I wish there was something I felt so strongly about.'' Ms. <PERSON> Eber </PERSON> said she does n't push her views on her grandchildren. But if they ask, she tries to explain why she is risking incarceration. `` I tell them that they must always question and never close their minds,'' she said. And while she will miss her family if she does go to prison, she has no regrets about her activism. `` For me it's going to be very lonely, to be separated from my family,'' she said. `` But I feel I'm doing it for them.''

 <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Caron </PERSON>, the producer whose creative genius powered the comic eccentricities of the <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION> series `` Moonlighting'' has left the show, the <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Variety </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>, who had been working as co-executive producer on the Emmy-award winning show during the past two seasons will take over as executive producer, the trade publication reported Thursday. The newspaper attributed <PERSON> Caron </PERSON>'s departure to the network. Variety said reports were circulating that <PERSON> Caron </PERSON> had told <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> network officials they would have to decide whether they wanted him or actress <PERSON> Cybill </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON> to return to the show, but <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> denied this. Miss Shepherd, who co-stars with actor <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON>, plays <PERSON> Maddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, a financially devastated glamour queen who returns to run a detective agency she had purchased as a tax-shelter. `` Moonlighting'' satirized the TV detective genre, often turning the conventional end-of-the-show chase scene into a campy free-for-all. The show also broke ground by deliberately mocking its own television format. The show was energized by the hot-and-cold relationship between Miss Shepherd's sensual princess and <PERSON> Willis </PERSON>' irreverent, street-wise character, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Addison </PERSON>. Their banter sometimes evolved into witty dual monologues, with each character talking without listening to the other. <PERSON> Caron </PERSON>, a reputed perfectionist, often worked on the scripts himself and frequently pushed beyond deadlines for the show. He also directed `` Clean and Sober,'' the critically acclaimed <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Keaton </PERSON> film currently in release.

 A hotel bellhop honored for saving a handicapped man from his burning apartment after a fireman had given up says he does n't want to be recognized as a hero, `` Thank you was more than enough.''

 Hundreds of radical students shouting `` Yankee go home!'' mounted protests against the Olympics today on the eve of Games and burned an effigy of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Students staged protests at three schools in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> to demand the Olympics be shared with communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and to denounce the government of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo. The Olympics start Saturday. `` Oppose dictator's Olympics!'' and `` Crush military aggression!'' students yelled. About 300 protesters armed with firebombs and clubs marched out of <ORGANIZATION> Kookmin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> to fight riot police after burning effigies of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, as well as a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag. But riot police watched from a distance and did not intervene as the protesters repeatedly blocked traffic. Students, one of whom hurled a single firebomb at a passing police truck and missed, tired of taunting police and dispersed. About 500 students took part in a similar protest at <ORGANIZATION> Seoul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in the south of the capital. They marched to the gate and burned an effigy of <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>. Riot police in green combat fatigues and black, visored helmets watched but did not intervene. The students made no move to attack the police. The protesters then marched to a gym on the campus where Olympic table tennis events are to be held and yelled anti-Olympic slogans outside the building before dispersing. A small anti-Olympic protest was also held at <ORGANIZATION> Yonsei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> with less than 100 students taking part. Anti-Olympic protests have been small by Korean standards, and the radicals have failed to attract support. Violent clashes with riot police have dropped sharply in recent days as the number of students taking part has dwindled. A few onlookers even shouted abuse at protesters at <LOCATION> Kookmin </LOCATION>, accusing them of trying to wreck the Olympics. `` Go home. You are shaming our nation,'' screamed an angry old man. The radicals are demanding the Olympics be shared with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to promote reunification of the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, divided since 1945. Radicals also contend the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> government is a front for military rule and is using the Olympics to cement its rule with aid from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The great majority of <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION>, including most students, want the Olympics to be a major success. `` Students know the people are against these demonstrations,'' a student leader said today. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is boycotting the Olympics because its demand to be a co-host of the Games was rejected. The International Olympic Committee said the Games are awarded to a single city and can not be shared.

 Accusations against 19 defendants in the fraud trial over the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supply </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION>'s default on $ 2.25 billion in bonds amounts to `` fraud by hindsight,'' a defense lawyer says `` There is no evidence to support charges of conspiracy,'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickles </PERSON>, representing the engineering firm of <ORGANIZATION> Ebasco </ORGANIZATION>, said in opening statements Thursday. Jurors were told by other defense attorneys that utility officials who sat on the system's board of directors were part-time public servants who relied on experts and had nothing to gain by misleading investors who bought bonds in the two nuclear plants. `` These people always acted in good faith,'' said <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Malanca </PERSON>, who represents 12 of the 16 public utilities that are among defendants. `` They had no motive to do wrong.'' <PERSON> Malanca </PERSON> opened the defendants' case by disputing plaintiff attorneys' arguments that utility members of the <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> board controlled the supply system and plotted to defraud bond buyers. Defendants, including another engineering firm and a financial adviser to <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION>, are accused of making misrepresentations and withholding crucial information from investors who bought bonds to finance construction of two nuclear power plants. Plaintiffs include more than 24,000 bond buyers in the case, which resulted from the 1983 default by <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> on the $ 2.25 billion in bonds. It was the biggest default in the history of the municipal bond market. The trial began last week. The judge excused jurors until Monday, when opening arguments by defense attorneys were to resume. <PERSON> Nickles </PERSON> said what happened to the WPPSS projects was happening to the entire nuclear industry by the late 1970s. He said plant-construction prices dramatically escalated because of inflation and required changes to make nuclear plants safer. And the 1979 Three Mile Island accident, he said, `` wrecked the nuclear industry.'' <PERSON> Malanca </PERSON> told jurors that the plaintiffs would have them believe the 16 utility defendants had the power to control federal and state agencies, and were able to induce major engineering and financial firms to knowingly make false claims on official bond statements. But the utilities were relatively small, and were far down on the pecking order among the energy powers in the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, he said. The federal <ORGANIZATION> Bonneville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, he said, dominated the region. While <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> in the 1970s, with five nuclear plants under construction, was also a major player in the energy scene, said <PERSON> Malanca </PERSON>, the utility officials that directed it were part-time participants. He said they considered their appointments to the board a matter of civic duty, went to meetings only periodically, hired the best experts they could find, and generally followed directions of those experts and <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION>. The supply system staff had more power in directing <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> and board members were not even to speak to the media as representatives of <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION>, he said. `` If they did anything wrong, they were acting as board members of the supply system, not of the utilities,'' he said. He stressed that public utility officials are not paid, receiving only per diem allowances for their work. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Bromley </PERSON>, another defense lawyer, said utilities from the 23-member <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> board sent one representative each to the supply system. But, he said, the utilities had no control at all over how that representative voted and did n't stand a chance of controlling the supply system. The supply system was created in 1957 to build and operate major power-generating facilities in the Northwest.

<HEAD>Dollar Steady in Thin Trading, Gold Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar was trading steadily in thin late-morning trading in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> today, with players saying they expected the dollar to stay in a narrow range throughout the session. Gold prices moved lower. Foreign exchange dealers in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> said that volume was limited and that there were few commercial orders as activity wound down for the weekend. They said that the market remained bullish about the dollar due to the narrower-than-expected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> July trade deficit reported Wednesday. But they cautioned that the general opinion was that the world's major central banks appeared content with the dollar's present levels, and that any attempt to push it much higher would invite intervention `` I see the dollar gaining ground, but nobody wants to be the first the try stepping over 1.88 -LRB- West German -RRB- marks,'' said a trader in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> with a major Italian commercial bank. He predicted that the dollar would trade within a range of between 1.87 marks and 1.88 marks today. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where the business day ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s begins, the dollar rose 0.31 yen to a closing 133.76 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 134.10 yen. Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Thursday: _ 1.8741 West German marks, down from 1.8775 _ 1.5810 Swiss francs, down from 1.5820 _ 6.3735 French francs, down from 6.3790 _ 2.1133 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1160 _ 1,397.25 Italian lire, down from 1,398.87 _ 1.2235 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2225 In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound rose to $ 1.6755, Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 417 a troy ounce, down from $ 417.75 bid late Thursday. At mid-morning Friday, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $ 417.30 In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the bid price was $ 417.20, down from $ 417.50 bid late Thursday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold fell $ 3.61 to close at a bid $ 419.84. Silver was quoted in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> today at a bid price of $ 6.46 a troy ounce, up from Thursday's $ 6.44.

<HEAD>Study Says Trees' Contribution To Ozone Has Been Ignored</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Scientists trying to get to the root of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s ozone pollution should reconsider the role trees play, researchers say Trees contribute such a high amount of hydrocarbons to the atmosphere, pollution-control efforts would be more effective if they sought to limit nitrogen oxide instead, according to research by <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION> faculty members. Aware of <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s `` killer trees'' theories of 1980, <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION> geophysicist W.L. <PERSON> Chameides </PERSON> hastens to say that trees do n't cause ozone pollution any more than the sun does. <PERSON> Chameides </PERSON> concedes the conclusions place him and his colleagues out on a scientific limb, but said Thursday, `` I think there are other scientists that are coming along with us.'' He said he expected that the conclusions would be accepted, despite what he called `` institutional inertia.'' Ozone is produced by the combination of sunlight, hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides. It protects the Earth from harmful radiation at high atmospheric levels, but can harm humans and crops at low levels. All three ingredients must exist before ozone can be formed, and `` no one has inferred from that that the sun was a polluter or that we should put a big screen over the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to protect it,'' <PERSON> Chameides </PERSON> said. During the 1980 presidential campaign, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> angered environmentalists by suggesting that trees and other parts of nature were the chief culprits of air pollution. The idea led to jokes about `` killer trees'' and the appearance of protesters who dressed themselves as trees and carried signs saying, `` Chop Us Down Before We Kill Again.'' <PERSON> Chameides </PERSON> stressed that the researchers do not suggest cutting down trees, but instead believe pollution control efforts should center on nitrogen oxides, which are produced by many of the same processes that emit hydrocarbons. <PERSON> Chameides </PERSON> led a team of <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION> researchers who studied the production of hydrocarbons, or hydrogen-carbon compounds, in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, a heavily wooded city that frequently fails to meet federal air-quality standards. The study found that vegetation, principally trees, emit as many hydrocarbons as cars and factories, and on a hot day can provide enough hydrocarbons on their own to form illegal levels of ozone. Published in today's edition of Science magazine, the study says the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to attack ozone through limiting hydrocarbons is therefore doomed to failure. The Clean Air Act has sought to limit ozone through devices on cars and in factories that reduce the emission of hydrocarbons, paying little attention to nitrogen oxide, <PERSON> Chameides </PERSON> said. `` We've pursued the hydrocarbon strategy for about 10 years or so, and I think it's pretty clear that for some reason we have not been successful,'' <PERSON> Chameides </PERSON> said. `` We need to re-evaluate what we're doing instead of continuing down the same garden path.'' <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> agreed that air-quality rules have not succeeded in reducing ozone levels significantly. But he said, `` We estimate that in the absence of control programs, -LRB- hydrocarbon levels -RRB- would be close to 80 percent higher than they actually are. We've basically treaded water in the'80s.'' During the creation of ozone, natural hydrocarbons are used up faster than man-made hydrocarbons `` and thus can have a significant effect in spite of their low concentrations,'' the study says. <PERSON> Chameides </PERSON> said his findings `` should be viewed cautiously,'' but he added, `` Just because there are some uncertainties, you do n't ignore a source of 50 percent of hydrocarbons We've got to include all of the scientific evidence that's available.'' He said he is anxious for other scientists to check his work and for research to be conducted in other cities.

<HEAD>State Appellate Court Overturns Tax-Limiting Proposition 62</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A state appellate court has overturned a 1986 initiative sponsored by tax activist <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON> that requires voters to approve all taxes imposed by local governments. In declaring Proposition 62 unconstitutional, the <ORGANIZATION> 4th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled Thursday that requiring voter approval constitutes a `` gross interference with the fiscal responsiblity of local governments.'' `` It's a sad day for the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> taxpayer,'' said <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reduction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The anti-tax group campaigned for Proposition 62 after <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON> died on Aug. 12, 1986. The measure was approved by state voters in November 1986. The appellate court reversed a decision by a <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge in January, who upheld Proposition 62 against a legal challenge brought by the city of <LOCATION> Westminster </LOCATION> and said the measure was `` constitutional and enforceable.'' The initiative sponsored by <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON>, the self-styled tax reformer, requires local governmental agencies to stop collecting any new tax imposed after July 31, 1985, unless it is approved by the voters by Nov. 5, 1988. <PERSON> Javis </PERSON> drafted Proposition 62 several months before he died. He said it was needed to plug loopholes in the landmark Proposition 13, the statewide initiative passed in 1978 that <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON> backed and which sharply curtailed property taxes. Agencies failing to comply with Proposition 62 would face the loss of an equivalent amount of property tax revenue. Westminster is among 45 municipalities in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> that faced a potential loss of property tax revenue under the measure, state and county officials said. The unanimous appellate court ruling, written by Justice <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, found that <PERSON> Westminster </PERSON> has the authority to impose a utility users tax without a citywide vote. Just what effect the ruling will ultimately have is unclear, however, because a similar case in <LOCATION> Sonoma </LOCATION> has been appealed to the <ORGANIZATION> 1st </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> said his organization would appeal the 4th District ruling to the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. If the high court chooses not to accept the case on appeal, <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> said his group would consult with others to consider mounting another initiative campaign.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Vietnamese experts will conduct unprecedented joint field investigations this month, asking villagers about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen lost in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> more than 15 years ago, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said. Lt. Col. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> said Thursday that the two sides agreed in talks earlier this week to form two joint teams to search a broad area roughly 38 miles north of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s capital, <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>. The search will begin Sept. 25 and last about 10 days, <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> said. It would be the first time <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> specialists will be allowed to interview villagers in the countryside and the first joint field activity since the two sides in late 1985 unearthed the wreckage of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> B-52 bomber near <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>, commander of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casualty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, headed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side at this week's talks. `` We're going to do joint investigations of incidents, not just crash sites, but places where people were last thought to be but we do n't know exactly what happened to them,'' <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. `` I think it's a very significant development,'' he said. `` We think this will be the first of many such joint activities,'' he said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants to account for nearly 1,800 servicemen and civilians listed as missing in action, or MIA, from the war that cost about 58,000 American lives until <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces withdrew in 1973. Since communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> defeated U.S.-backed <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in April 1975, ending the war, progress on the MIA issue has been hampered by frequent bickering and the lack of diplomatic relations between <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> said each joint search team will include three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> experts drawn from the casualty resolution center and the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Identification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>, both Honolulu-based units entrusted with resolving the fate of missing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen. The teams will talk to local government officials and villagers who may have witnessed the incidents in which the American soldiers were lost, he said. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> said the teams would focus on several of the 70 `` discrepancy cases'' that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has asked <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to resolve urgently. In these cases, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says there is strong evidence the men survived and were captured or otherwise came under Vietnamese control, and Vietnamese authorities should have information about them. They include cases where downed airmen failed to emerge from prisoner-of-war camps. `` Potentially all the -LRB- discrepancy -RRB- cases could be resolved'' through a series of joint investigations, <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> said. A special <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidential envoy, retired Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON>, gave Foreign Minister <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Co </PERSON> <PERSON> Thach </PERSON> the list of 70 names in August 1987, when the two men reached agreement on accelerating cooperation on the issue. In July this year, <PERSON> Thach </PERSON> pledged to try to resolve the 70 cases by year's end. In return for cooperation on the MIA issue, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has sent medical teams to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and encouraged private relief organizations to help the impoverished nation. The sixth such medical team visited <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> Sept. 6-7.

 The government closed all schools for the day today, saying anti-government rebels planned to use the children to provoke civil unrest on this war-torn island. `` The closure ... is a precautionary measure taken by the government to prevent those groups committed to violence using innocent schoolchildren to forment civil disturbances in the country,'' a government statement said. On Thursday, the government imposed emergency laws to curb strikes by Sinhalese militants who oppose an accord aimed at ending five years of bloodshed in the northern and eastern provinces. President <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayawardene </PERSON>'s government invoked the emergency laws declaring all shops, transport and health agencies as essential services. Any essential services that close without the government's permission may be indefinitely shut down or seized, it said The moves follow a nationwide strike Monday called by the <PERSON> Janata </PERSON> <PERSON> Vimukti </PERSON> <PERSON> Peramuna </PERSON>, or <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, to protest the death of a Sinhalese lawyer while in police custody. The strike paralyzed businesses and public transport nationwide. The government contends most businesses closed because of threats by Sinhalese militants. The front is the most militant Sinhalese group. It has vowed to kill anyone who supports the peace agreement that would grant Tamils limited autonomy in the northern and eastern provinces and end their war for a separate nation. At least 500 people, including members of the governing <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, have been killed by Sinhalese militants. <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> last week merged the two provinces, which the Tamils claim as their homeland, and said a provincial council would be chosen later to take over administrative duties now handled by the federal government. The merger is a key provision of the peace accord, signed by <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> in July 1987. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, which has an estimated 47,000 troops stationed on the island, became involved in the conflict because 60 million Tamils living in southern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> are sympathetic to the rebels' cause. Sinhalese militants contend the accord grants too many concessions to the Tamils, who comprise 18 percent of the island's 16 million people Tamils, mostly Hindu, claim they are discriminated against by the Sinhalese, mostly Buddhists, who make up 75 percent of the population and control the government and the military.

 Riot squads used tear gas and a water cannon to disperse daylong protests in downtown <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> after <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s two top labor leaders were sent into internal exile. An undetermined number of protesters were taken into custody during the demonstration Thursday, which was prompted when <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bustos </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, federation vice president, were exiled for 1 -LCB- years for allegedly violating security laws by calling a violence-marred national strike. <PERSON> Bustos </PERSON> was sent by police car to <LOCATION> Parral </LOCATION>, 210 miles south of <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> was flown in a police plane to <LOCATION> Chanaral </LOCATION>, 600 miles to the north. Each must spend the next 541 days within those city limits. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bricklayers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, said he and other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, Canadian and European unionists were `` viciously attacked'' by military police when they joined the protest march and were caught up in the confrontation. <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> said through a spokeswoman, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Dresser </PERSON>, at union headquarters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that union leaders from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and 10 European nations had joined a protest march to the Palace of Justice when they were `` caught in a melee'' between demonstrators and police. <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Doherty </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> were knocked down and tear-gassed by police. <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> said six other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> members of the delegation also were roughed up. Dresser indicated that none of the Americans required hospitalization. <PERSON> Bustos </PERSON> and <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> were found guilty and sentenced Aug. 20 by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which reversed a lower court acquittal. The high court also gave federation strike coordinator <PERSON> Moises </PERSON> <PERSON> Labrana </PERSON> a 60-day suspended jail sentence. The three were convicted of breaking Chilean internal security law by calling for a general strike last Oct. 7 to protest the right-wing military government's economic policies and to support demands for wage increases. The strike received limited support, but set off street disturbances in which three people were killed. The two union leaders had been free pending an appeal, which was unsucessful.

 Demonstrators against government austerity measures smashed store windows with rocks, looted shops and clashed with riot police. Officials said leftist guerrillas infiltrated the downtown protest. Thousands of pedestrians trying to escape the riots Thursday ran through streets filled with tear gas fired by police. Most were unable to find shelter because stores and restaurants closed their doors when the violence started. The government gave no report on the number of injured, but two protesters were seen bleeding from the head. Police made 30 arrests. Small groups of demonstrators blocked traffic Thursday afternoon and shouted insults against harsh anti-inflation austerity measures announced last week by the center-left government of President <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>. The measures included price increases of as much as 300 percent for food staples and gasoline to eliminate costly government subsidies that were contributing to inflation expected to top 900 percent this year. In addition to the protests against the steep price increases, about 300 striking civilian workers from a navy shipyard clashed with police troopers who fired tear gas grenades to keep the strikers from reaching the government palace. Police said members of the Maoist-inspired <ORGANIZATION> Shining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement infiltrated the demonstrators and urged them on to violence. Men in hoods were seen among the protesters. Police said the protesters smashed store windows and looted a book shop and a clothing store only two blocks from the government palace. Riot police regained control in the downtown area after several hours. In other violence Thursday, police said an assassination team of Maoist rebels fired on a navy captain as he was driving his young daughter to school in an upper-class neighborhood, wounding him twice in the stomach and twice in the left leg. Police said the daughter, whose age was not available, was not hurt in the attack. Four suspected members of the Shining Path armed with three revolvers and sticks of dynamite were arrested as they tried to escape on foot, police said.

 The 1988 drought has increased the need for more mental health services in rural areas, says a former <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> official. `` The drought this summer has made a bad situation worse for many,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergland </PERSON>, the ex-secretary of agriculture who headed a special commission on rural mental health problems. Citing research conducted before the drought, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s commission on rural mental health issued a study Thursday recommending the creation of a federal office of rural mental health and increased funds for alcohol, drug abuse and mental health programs. The study, `` Rural Mental Health: The Time for Action Is Now,'' also recommends a broader crisis counseling network for farmers. `` We're fighting a myth that rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is a healthier place to live. If that was ever true, it's not true today,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beeson </PERSON>, director of planning for the <ORGANIZATION> Nebraska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bergland </PERSON> said much of the stress on rural residents is triggered by economic problems. Besides the economy, other parts of the rural environment have changed, the study said. The traditional image of a closely-knit rural community revolving around church and family activities no longer fits, the report said. Consequently, psychological distress becomes more common, and rural residents' problems often are n't treated promptly because rural areas frequently lack mental health services, <PERSON> Bergland </PERSON> said. `` The biggest problem is n't that we're sicker in rural places. The problem is we do n't have resources,'' said <PERSON> Bergland </PERSON> during a news conference to unveil the study.

 Authorities expect to file charges soon in the apparent sabotage of O-rings made for space shuttle booster rockets, an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent says. HydraPak, which manufactures the O-rings in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> suburb, discovered in June that a small number of the rubber-like seals had been deliberately cut. Officials notified booster maker <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>. The federal agencies began a joint investigation. `` We do have suspects and the case will be prosecutable,'' <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Special Agent <PERSON> Cal </PERSON> <PERSON> Clegg </PERSON> said Thursday. `` Right from the inception, we have been discussing the case with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney's office, and we feel that arrests or indictments will be imminent.'' <PERSON> Clegg </PERSON> said charges could be filed within a month. <PERSON> Clegg </PERSON> said he did not know whether more than one person was suspected, but the number `` could expand. ... It depends on the evidence that is gathered.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Dockstader </PERSON>, <PERSON> HydraPak </PERSON> vice president of production, said earlier that none of the damaged seals had been shipped to <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>, which manufactures the rockets at its northern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> plant. He said Thursday he could not comment on the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> probe. However, he said <PERSON> HydraPak </PERSON>'s internal investigation had determined that allegations of lax security, shipment of substandard O-rings and a company cover-up were without foundation. <PERSON> Dockstader </PERSON> said the internal investigation, completed Monday, found no `` irregularities in manufacturing, shipment or inspection processes'' or in the security procedures at the plant about 20 miles south of <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. He said steps had been taken to increase security, but would not give details. The O-rings are used as seals between segments of the booster rocket to prevent leakage of superhot gases from burning propellant. After the 1986 Challenger explosion, a presidential commission found that an O-ring allowed a plume of fiery gas to escape and ignite the shuttle's main liquid fuel tank, triggering the blast that killed the shuttle's seven astronauts. Improvements to the booster joint have been the focus of <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>'s effort to redesign the rocket. Last month the company conducted a final test-firing of the shuttle Discovery, the first flight planned since the Challenger disaster. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> has scheduled the launch for late this month or early October.

<HEAD>Former Navy Official to Plead in Wedtech Scandal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A former civilian <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> official agreed to plead guilty to taking a $ 60,000 bribe from <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> and related charges involving the scandal-plagued former defense contractor and another company. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, once head of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s small business program, will plead guilty to four criminal counts charging him with conspiracy to receive bribes and filing false income tax returns, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said Thursday. According to the charges, <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, 40, of <LOCATION> Clifton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, conspired to take a $ 60,000 bribe from <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> _ a now-defunct contractor _ for his help in obtaining $ 135 million in no-bid <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> contracts to build floating docks. The docks were designed to move supplies from ship to shore for the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Rapid Deployment Force. At the time, <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> was director of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization, and was responsible for assisting minority-owned and minority-operated businesses obtain contracts without competitive bidding under a special <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION>, said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Baruch </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>. Former <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> officials have admitted committing fraud to keep the company in the program even though it was neither minority-owned nor controlled. One of those officials, former executive vice president <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>, testified at the racketeering trial of ex-Rep. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> earlier this year that <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> was `` a mole'' who supplied <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> with inside information from the office of then-Navy Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON> <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> Democrat, and five others were convicted of various corruption charges in August. They are awaiting sentencing. <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> also was charged with plotting to take $ 120,000 in bribes from <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Con </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Lancaster </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, for help in obtaining no-bid contracts worth $ 54 million to supply the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> with other equipment. In addition, <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> was charged with failing to include the money he got from <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Con </ORGANIZATION> on his 1982 and 1983 tax returns. He faces up to five years in prison and a $ 10,000 fine on each of the conspiracy counts and three years imprisonment and $ 250,000 in fines on each tax count, said <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 Top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials are for the first time talking seriously about removing military bases from the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, and the chief <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> negotiator says the country is preparing for such a possibility but still negotiating. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said Thursday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants to keep giant <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Subic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> and other installations in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> but `` there are alternatives which we are having now to examine.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said talks in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> on bases compensation and other issues `` basically are n't going well.'' On Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> told visiting Philippine Foreign Minister <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON>, in what one official described as blunt terms, that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is prepared to pull out of the bases if the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> insists on too much compensation. Other officials have suggested they might be relocated to <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION> or elsewhere in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, with estimates of the cost of such a move ranging over $ 10 billion. Defense officials have said in the past that the bases are vital to security of a vast area stretching from <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> into the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said in a speech today that the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> is ready to give up its base at <LOCATION> Cam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ranh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, if <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces leave the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have said this would not be a balanced exchange. <PERSON> Cam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ranh </PERSON> <PERSON> Bay </PERSON> is the Soviets' major naval deployment base abroad, while <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> and <PERSON> Subic </PERSON> are the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>'s largest foreign bases. <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON>, in an interview Thursday, said the two sides in the negotiations now in recess are not far apart on how much the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration should seek from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in direct payment for use of the bases, but several other issues in the talks remain unresolved. `` Both sides agree that the hard component -LRB- cash -RRB- of our mutual proposals were not too far apart and that in addition we would be looking for creative ways of raising the level of the compensation to that which was proposed by the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> said. He said additional help might come in the form of procurement of Philippine products and the writing off of some of the nation's $ 26 billion foreign debt. <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> did not say how much aid has been offered by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> panel, but congressional sources have said it is close to $ 500 million, including a doubling of direct bases-related aid to $ 360 million for fiscal 1989. <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> declined to say how much the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> originally wanted, but <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> news reports have put the demand as high as $ 1.2 billion a year. <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> said he was not surprised by <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>'s remarks about pulling out and asserted that the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> is preparing for a loss of the bases. He said studies show that conversion of the bases to civilian use could provide even more benefits, including replacement of the thousands of jobs that would be lost if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> pulls out. He said that while the bases provide significant economic benefit, even American analysts agree that their security value to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> is minimal. `` Your own analysts and your own leaders stress the priority importance of the global strategy that is fulfilled by these bases,'' he said. <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> said unresolved issues in the bases talks include the storage of nuclear weapons on the bases, ownership of improvements to the bases, procurement policies and the write-off of debts for military equipment. `` We have not gotten anything out of the American panel,'' he said. <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> said he is discussing the bases issue with a variety of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials but has not moved the negotiations from <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Surveys of Filipinos show only a small percentage of outright opposition to the bases, he said, but a large number of people say they would want the bases out if the Americans do not improve the bases agreement, including additional compensation. <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON>, who lived in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> self-exile during the last decade of ex-President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' rule, said he has found Democrats more responsive on Philippine issues than Republicans, but he said the views of the two parties on the bases appear to be the same. <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> plans to meet <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> again at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> at the end of the month. The Philippine official also will attend the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> debut of a musical comedy he wrote during his exile. The play, which deals with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> takeover of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> between 1898 and 1902, is called, `` Manifest Destiny: An Evening of Yankee Panky.''

<TEXT>
 The number of AIDS cases in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will jump nearly five-fold by 1992, and about 263,000 people will have died from the disease by then, the national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> predicts. As of this week, 72,766 AIDS cases have been reported to the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>; 41,064 people, or 56 percent, are dead. By the end of 1992, the number of cases will hit 365,000, and 72 percent of those patients will be dead, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> says. The predictions came Thursday in a report summarizing the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>'s latest quarterly report on AIDS to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s Domestic Policy Council Actual AIDS reporting has run slightly higher than predicted; the agency in 1986 predicted 15,800 cases in 1986 and 23,000 in 1987, and the actual totals were 17,100 and 25,200, respectively. `` We think they're very close,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dondero </PERSON>, an AIDS specialist at the Atlanta-based health agency. `` I think the message is that, at least for the first couple of years, this ... method gives some pretty reliable estimates.'' The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 issued its AIDS predictions for 1991, which forecast 270,000 cases by the end of that year. In the report released Thursday, the agency predicts 80,000 cases of AIDS in 1992 alone, with 66,000 deaths that year. A total of 172,000 living AIDS patients will require medical care in 1992, at a cost of $ 5 billion to $ 13 billion, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> predicts. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> also said its current estimate of 1 million to 1.5 million Americans currently infected with the virus which causes AIDS is `` a reasonable working estimate,'' based on mathematical analysis by experts convened by the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> in April. Thursday's report noted that the national infection estimate has remained the same since it was devised in 1986. The rate is about 0.4 percent to 0.6 percent. `` This does not mean that no new infections have occurred,'' the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The 1986 estimate was based on preliminary data, and was probably too high -LRB- at the time -RRB-.''

 The man who admitted killing two people with homemade bombs to cover up his forgeries of Mormon documents was in critical but stable condition today from a drug overdose in prison, a hospital official said. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Hofmann </PERSON>, 33, was in a coma when taken by helicopter from the <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prison </ORGANIZATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, officials said. He began coming out of the coma shortly before midnight Thursday. Hospital spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dwan </PERSON> said the overdose was from an undetermined tricyclic anti-depressant drug, which showed up in lab tests at toxic levels. <PERSON> Hofmann </PERSON> also suffered `` minor to moderate burns'' on his right forearm and chest, he said. He said the cause of the burns was not immediately known, but they were not considered serious. <PERSON> Hofmann </PERSON> had been prescribed a sleeping medication, but <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Benavidez </PERSON>, a state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said he did not know what it was, or the dosage. <PERSON> Hofmann </PERSON> is serving a five years to life prison term following his January 1987 plea agreement, in which he admitted killing two people in 1985. At a hearing before the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pardons </ORGANIZATION> in January, <PERSON> Hofmann </PERSON> said he felt remorse for the families of his victims, but the board ruled 2-1 that he should spend the rest of his life in prison. From 1981 to 1985, <PERSON> Hofmann </PERSON> had virtually set the agenda for scholars of Mormon history with a string of discoveries of purported documents relating to early church history. Most later proved to be his own forgeries, some of which were expertly done while others were crude.

 A man who says he's paid $ 2,000 in traffic fines held up a sign warning motorists to slow down because police were ahead _ and was promptly arrested for obstructing traffic. `` I stood there for about 20 minutes,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Thiry </PERSON> said Thursday. `` That would have been about a total of $ 3,000 -LRB- in fines -RRB- they would have gotten people for.'' <PERSON> Thiry </PERSON>, 22, of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, was arrested Wednesday on obstructing traffic charges after he stood on <LOCATION> Schenley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plaza </LOCATION> with a sign that read `` Slow down. Police ahead with <ORGANIZATION> VASCAR </ORGANIZATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> VASCAR </ORGANIZATION> is a device akin to a stop watch that calculates a car's speed by measuring the time it takes for a car to travel between two lines painted across the street `` I stopped a lot of people from having a miserable day,'' he said. `` People were beeping at me. They were waving.'' <PERSON> Thiry </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> police `` make you go 25 -LRB- mph -RRB- where they know 25 is an unreasonably slow speed. Try and go the speed limit and just see what happens. See how many people pass you.'' Police Chief <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Pampena </PERSON> said there are signs posted throughout the city warning drivers that police use VASCAR devices to enforce speed limits. `` The signs are very clear,'' he said. `` If the signs are posted as 25 mph, then that's the speed we expect people to go.'' <PERSON> Thiry </PERSON> said he was upset because he had been issued many tickets, recently had lost his license for the third time and had to leave a job as a salesman. The tickets included at least five in the past two years from police using VASCAR devices, plus others for speeding on the interstate, he said. He estimated he has paid about $ 2,000 in fines but said he has never been involved in a traffic accident. Police Sgt. <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> McCafferty </PERSON> and officer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Rourke </PERSON> said they noticed motorists suddenly were driving slower and arrested <PERSON> Thiry </PERSON> after a motorist informed them of the sign. <PERSON> Thiry </PERSON> said he will appeal the charge of obstructing traffic, which carries a fine of $ 48.50. `` I was n't blocking traffic,'' <PERSON> Thiry </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think they had the right to arrest me because I wanted to warn people. What if I was just yelling? That's freedom of speech.'' <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, commander of the traffic division, said, `` Any time you're out in the street, you're obstructing traffic.''

 Mayor <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> has ordered two investigations into the alleged police beating of labor leader <PERSON> Dolores </PERSON> <PERSON> Huerta </PERSON>, who lost her spleen and had three ribs broken during a political demonstration. `` I am deeply concerned and disturbed about this incident,'' <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> said Thursday after visiting the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> co-founder at her hospital bed. Ms. <PERSON> Huerta </PERSON>, 58, was listed in stable condition today at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> General </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. The beating occurred Wednesday during protests at a campaign appearance by Republican presidential candidate <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> ordered Police Chief <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> and the director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Complaints </ORGANIZATION> to conduct separate investigations into the incident. Ms. <PERSON> Huerta </PERSON> was among demonstrators who gathered on sidewalks in front of a hotel on Union Square. After 20 minutes of warning of protesters to move behind barricades, police tactical squads began to sweep the crowd, <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said. `` Somewhere in the half-block segment, she apparently was injured,'' he said. Agnos reviewed police tapes for 90 minutes. He said he identified Ms. <PERSON> Huerta </PERSON> in the crowd but neither he nor <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> could see on film whether she was being struck. `` We could see she was being very cooperative,'' <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> said. ` We could even read her lips saying ` I am moving.''' At a news conference in front of the hospital Thursday, family and friends of Ms. <PERSON> Huerta </PERSON>'s expressed outrage at the alleged police beating. `` I want to condemn the city of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and the Police Department for permitting this type of activity to go on,'' said tearful son <PERSON> Emilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Huerta </PERSON>. He said his mother was trying to speak to reporters outside the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francis </LOCATION> hotel to respond to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s statements against the <ORGANIZATION> UFW </ORGANIZATION> grape boycott when she was `` herded'' into an area `` where she was severely beaten by a member of the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` It was n't a beating over the head or push _ she was speared and stabbed to where her spleen was shattered,'' he said.

 The wives of two <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> professors held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> said today they believe the kidnappers' demands have softened and their husbands will be freed soon. <PERSON> Badr </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, wife of <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, a mathematics professor, and <PERSON> Feryal </PERSON> <PERSON> Polhill </PERSON>, wife of professor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Polhill </PERSON>, spoke a day after the Islamic Jihad for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> issued a handwritten statement and a photograph of two hostages to a Western news agency in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The statement, written in Arabic, hinted that the Moslem group would free its hostages if the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration undertook an initiative within one week in support of the Palestinian uprising in Israeli-occupied territories. The unrest began Dec. 8. The two <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> educators pictured _ Turner, 41, of <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Alann </PERSON> <PERSON> Steen </PERSON>, 49, of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> _ have been held for nearly 20 months. They were seized along with <PERSON> Polhill </PERSON>, 54, originally of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Mithileshwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, 60, an Indian who is a legal resident alien of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, on Jan. 24, 1987 from the campus of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-affiliated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> by gunmen posing as riot police. Official <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy is that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> will not bargain with the captors. `` We feel they are going to be released,'' <PERSON> Badr </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. But she added: `` We do n't want to be over-optimistic to avoid disappointment.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, a Lebanese of Palestinian origin, delivered the couple's first child, a baby girl, six months after her husband was kidnapped. `` It's a positive statement,'' she said of the message released by Islamic Jihad. `` It looks like they've -LRB- the kidnappers -RRB- relaxed their conditions. This makes one be more, may be a little more, optimistic.'' `` We ca n't say anything concrete has happened but it's a step toward a solution,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Polhill </PERSON> in a separate interview. <PERSON> Steen </PERSON>'s wife, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, was traveling in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and could not be reached. The picture showed <PERSON> Steen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, smiling broadly, resting on a mattress with a flowered pattern and a violet pillow. Each was holding a cigarette. Both wore navy blue outfits and had long hair. <PERSON> Steen </PERSON> was clean-shaven, and <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> had a bushy beard. The Islamic Jihad group is believed to be sympathetic to the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> as well as <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s revolutionary patriarch <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>. The four educators are among 17 foreigners missing and believed held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, nine of them Americans. The longest held is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, who was kidnapped in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on March 16, 1985. The statement said, `` Our organization plans to undertake a positive initiative to ease the issue of the hostages. But it needs adequate reactions by international forums toward the rights of our Moslem -LRB- Palestinian -RRB- people in their struggle against the Zionist enemy. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration should be the first among the governments that should declare a clear, positive stance toward the rights of our people in harmony with its claims of defending human rights.'' It concluded, `` At this sensitive stage of the uprising led by comrade strugglers in the interior -LRB- of the occupied territories -RRB-, we offer this initiative and expect from the governments concerned a response within one week of the publication of this statement. We then will be ready to advance further in this initiative.'' The statement said the group's offer was timed to coincide with the 10th month of the Palestinian uprising. <PERSON> Steen </PERSON> was a communications instructor when kidnapped from the college and <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> a visiting professor of mathematics and computer science. <PERSON> Polhill </PERSON> lectured in accounting and <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> was a visiting professor of finance.

 <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> school officials have gone into the fashion business in hopes of cashing in on the community's trendy image to help pay the bills. More than 50 products featuring pastels and geometric designs with the <ORGANIZATION> Beverly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hills </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> logo were to be unveiled today in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Next month, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> gets a look at the fashion line. School board member <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Fenton </PERSON> suggested the idea three years ago. `` Not every child can attend a <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> school, but I want to give every child the opportunity to wear our T-shirts, sweat shirts and our logo,'' he said. 20th Century <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> is handling licensing and sales. Fox officials would not quote a price range for the clothes, but the district will get 60 percent of the profits. The district hopes to make $ 250,000 this year. The district, with an annual budget of $ 26 million, is known for high teacher salaries, small class sizes and a high school cafeteria where students have the option of ordering a meal a la carte. But falling enrollments, increasing operating expenses and property tax limits have strained resources. The idea has n't been a hit with all <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> residents, however. `` This is one more piece of tinsel being added to the city,'' said <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, a longtime resident and community activist. `` Rodeo Drive is a circus and it has taken over everything.''

<HEAD>Los Angeles to Pay Homeless for Possessions Destroyed in Sweep</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Forty-one homeless people whose possessions were destroyed in a police sweep will receive $ 500 each, according to terms of a settlement that some recipients said could free them from life on the street. The city admitted no wrongdoing in the agreement, which provides $ 20,500 to be divided among those affected in the incident. City officials confirmed the settlement Thursday but declined to comment. The claims resulted from a June police sweep of two homeless camps in the shadow of City Hall. Authorities said they gave an estimated 50 people 30 minutes to clear out, but many were away looking for food or work. They returned to find their possessions _ including medicine, identification papers and clothing _ were gone. Although the agreement does n't guarantee that such sweeps wo n't be conducted again, lawyers representing the homeless said it is an important victory that should discourage officials from similar seizures `` I believe this has already affected the attitude and practice of police everywhere in this city,'' said attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who filed the claims on behalf of the homeless men and women. Many of the recipients said they would use the $ 500 to find permanent shelter. `` We're going to get a place and get married,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, 27, of his plans for the money. `` I'm trying to get ahead, I'm trying to have a future,'' said <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, who added he has been sleeping on the street while studying word processing at a technical school. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON>, 48, said he hopes to `` get a place and get off the street. The streets are making me old.'' However, <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, an activist for the homeless and one of the 41 to file a claim against the city, warned: `` Five hundred dollars is not going to get anybody off the street.''

 The power of suggestion has taken on a new meaning for American corporations as increased competition forces them to look for cost-cutting measures from within. The old employee suggestion box is getting a workout, and companies are rewarding innovative ideas handsomely. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suggestion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> says its 900 member companies saved more than $ 2 billion last year as a result of their employees' suggestion programs.

One of those employees was <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 51, of <PERSON> Yorba </PERSON> <PERSON> Linda </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, who was named the association's `` Suggester of the Year'' at the organization's annual conference in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> this week. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, a scientist for <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, submitted ideas that resulted in cost-saving improvements totaling $ 22 million in 1987, company officials said. The company program does not provide for direct financial rewards, but `` there's a direct relationship between your suggestions and your salary raises,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> says. One of his suggestions saved about 15,000 hours of technician labor annually. Another lightened the weight of satellites, cutting down on launch costs. `` When you come up with a really good idea, you know you did something important,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said Thursday. `` It's my way of keeping on top of the Christmas tree.'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, who works in the materials and process laboratory of <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>' Space and <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, is a compulsive suggester.

 High waves crashed along the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> coast today and flooding left thousands homeless as deadly Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> bore down on this border city, officials said today. Fleeing residents crowded into shelters as the storm pushed across the gulf carrying 120 mph winds. The hurricane left 17 people dead on the <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, officials said. Ten people were reported missing, and hundreds of thousands were driven from their homes on the battered peninsula. `` We're seeing the first victims. The gulf area is flooding and we're getting rains and wind,'' said <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> of the city press office, as <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>'s outer band pounded the coast with heavy rain. The city in a news release said at least 10,000 people spent the night in shelters set up at schools, churches and public buildings. Countless others fled homes in low-lying and poor areas. At least 5,000 people were rendered homeless near <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>. Sporadic rains and wind gusts of up to 35 mph were felt today as officials hustled to complete evacuating residents from the lowlands of the <LOCATION> Laguna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Madre </LOCATION> area and the fishing town of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pesca </LOCATION>, both north of the <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION>. The shelters were being stocked with blankets, food and water for up to 70,000 people. When the 450-mile-wide hurricane slammed into the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> resort of <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION> Wednesday, winds topped 160 mph. `` An indescribable, desolate panorama'' was how <PERSON> Ranulfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> of <PERSON> Novedades </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Yucatan </PERSON> described first reports today from isolated towns along Yucatan's north coast. `` It looks like an earthquake struck instead of a hurricane. The destruction is incredible.'' <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> said dozens of homes in Progreso were damaged or destroyed. Beaches were reconfigured or simply disappeared during the storm, appliances and furniture floated in empty streets, and large fishing vessels and yachts were deposited on land or `` piled together like logs.'' The storm left about 300,000 people homeless in <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> state and another 10,000 homeless in <LOCATION> Campeche </LOCATION>, the government news agency <ORGANIZATION> Notimex </ORGANIZATION> said today. <ORGANIZATION> Merida </ORGANIZATION> remained without electricity and long lines formed for drinking water outside government buildings. In <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>, as shelters began filling up, one woman said she had nowhere else to turn. `` Our house is very old, and it is n't any good. It could fall on top of us,'' said <PERSON> Guadalupe </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, 56, who stood with her family in the gusting wind outside a shelter at a local grade school. A steady stream of traffic jammed the highway leading inland as the hurricane threatened to strike the gulf coast just 20 miles from <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>, a city of about 280,000 people south of <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The National Weather Service in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> said if <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> continued in the same direction, it would strike the coast near the <LOCATION> Texas-Mexico </LOCATION> border sometime this evening. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Montiel </PERSON>, spokesman for the <LOCATION> Tamaulipas </LOCATION> state government, said that in the oil port of <LOCATION> Tampico </LOCATION>, with a population of about 700,000, people were evacuated from low-lying marshy areas to higher ground. <LOCATION> Tampico </LOCATION> lies about 200 miles south of <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Mexican officials opened floodgates in dams on the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> to prevent flash floods downriver once the storm hit. The hurricane left much of the Yucatan without communication, electricity or drinking water after it hit Wednesday. Most roads were blocked and supplies were running low. Airports in <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cozumel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chetumal </LOCATION> were opened only to aircraft with emergency supplies, while commercial flights remained suspended. <LOCATION> Campeche </LOCATION>'s governor declared the state a disaster area Thursday and appealed for relief supplies. In <LOCATION> Campeche </LOCATION>, the state capital on the peninsula's west coast, two babies drowned as residents of a poor, low-lying neighborhood tried to flee, said <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Cantu </PERSON>, editor of the Novedades de Campeche. Seven other people died, three by drowning and four when a wall collapsed on them in the town of <LOCATION> Dzidzantun </LOCATION> north of <LOCATION> Merida </LOCATION>, officials said. <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> worker <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Santamaria </PERSON> said rescue efforts were hampered by flooding, lack of power and gasoline.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> says there is n't `` an iota of truth'' to an account that aides questioned whether he was mentally fit to serve at the height of the Iran-Contra crisis. But a former aide said today it would have been irresponsible for him not to raise the issue. `` There's no truth to any of this,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Thursday when asked about the report in a new book that aides weighed whether to invoke the 25th Amendment, providing for the vice president to take over if a president is unable to discharge his duties. `` It's just ridiculous,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said while attending the annual White House picnic for members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` There is n't an iota of truth in the whole story.'' As to whether people were considering invoking the 25th Amendment, the president said, `` I never knew that anyone was. I do n't think anyone was.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> aide to <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> who was on the transition team when <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> succeeded <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> as White House chief of staff, confirmed most of the account, attributed to him, in the book `` Landslide'' by reporters <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON> of the Wall Street Journal and <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> <PERSON> McManus </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, published by <PERSON> Houghton </PERSON> <PERSON> Mifflin </PERSON>. Cannon, in an interview on `` CBS This Morning,'' defended his decision to raise the issue of the president's mental state and the possible use of the 25th Amendment to <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> after he had interviewed several White House staff members as part of the transition. `` I think it would have been irresponsible not to given what I had been told by senior staff member who had been working with him -LRB- <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, -RRB-'' <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON> said he interviewed <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aides on Feb. 27 and 28, 1987, just after <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> accepted the job, and `` a pattern of responses evolved that the real problem you have to worry about is the president. ... They would say he's not paying attention, he's not reading his memos, he does n't come to the office, he stays over in the residence. On March 1, the book says, <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON> wrote a memo to <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> suggesting that his first priority be to `` consider the possibility that section four of the 25th Amendment might be applied.'' After Cannon presented and discussed the memo at a meeting at <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s home that night, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> is quoted in the book as saying, `` Well, it does n't sound like the <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> I just saw, but we'll see tomorrow.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> on Thursday said he does not recall `` any serious consideration ever of invoking the 25th Amendment.'' He called <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` strong and assertive and perhaps the most presidential man I ever knew'' and said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was `` fully in charge, fully capable, and fully presidential.'' According to the book, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and his top aides were prepared, when they assembled in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wing </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> the White House the morning after <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON> raised the problem `` to watch the president closely, to determine whether he appeared mentally fit to serve.'' The account goes on to say that at a working lunch which <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and three aides attended, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> seemed relaxed and animated and <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON> wondered, `` What the hell is going on here? The old fella looks just dandy.'' Cannon, in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, said that of the staffers he talked to `` not all but most said in one way or another that the president was inattentive, that he had lost interest in his job.'' He later said on the CBS Evening News, `` My concern then and today is that they were more loyal to <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> than they were to <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>.'' Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the March 2 luncheon did occur, but `` Senator <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Culvahouse </PERSON> and others do n't describe any kind of situation the way <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON> does.'' `` What you have here is you have Cannon talking to a bunch of people who for all practical purposes had just been relieved of their duties. Effectively, every one knew when <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> left they were all leaving. They all were gone within a week.'' However, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawson </PERSON>, who was one of <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>'s top aides when he was chief of staff, said, `` Let's start thinking who those people might have been. There were not very many of them. I ca n't even get up to five. So Cannon has an arithmetic problem.'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>, asked in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, about the book's assertion that the president was out of touch, said: `` Well, I'm a little doubtful of that. Of course the White House was in somewhat of disorder. He was down because he had had an operation in early January, but I think by that time he had fully recovered from it. `` In his book `` For The Record,'' published last spring, <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> portrayed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as disengaged and indecisive. <PERSON> Dawson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON> did not talk to him. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said he did not talk to him either. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> also said that <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, then the deputy national security adviser, told him <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON> did not talk either to him or to his superior, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, who was succeeded as national security adviser by <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, is now secretary of defense. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallison </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> counsel, who was replaced by <PERSON> Culvahouse </PERSON> after <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> became chief of staff, said he did talk to <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON>, but `` he did n't ask me about the question of the president's mental health, and I did n't tell him anything about the president's mental health.'' `` I never saw anything that suggested the president was n't fully in charge,'' <PERSON> Wallison </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> made another pitch today for improving Soviet relations with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and renewed a call for a Sino-Soviet summit. `` We stand for the full normalization of relations with the People's Republic of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, for their development up to the level adequate to our two countries' responsiblity for peaceful world policy,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said in a major speech in the Siberian city of <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> first proposed a summit with <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> in a speech in the eastern Soviet city of <LOCATION> Vladivostok </LOCATION>, near the Chinese border, on July 28, 1986. Chinese Communist Party General Secretary <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> said last month the first Sino-Soviet summit since 1960 was possible if <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> first urged <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to leave <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. Since the <LOCATION> Vladivostok </LOCATION> speech, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has taken several steps to remove obstacles to improving ties with the Chinese. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has listed the impediments as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> intervention in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s support of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and Soviet troops stationed along the Soviet border with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> has moved to clear some of the obstacles. In May, it began withdrawing its troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and has pulled some of its forces out of <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION>, which borders <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also has offered to accept <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s request that the two countries' border be fixed at the main navigation channel in the <LOCATION> Amur </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> agreed to its first direct talks with the Chinese focusing solely on the <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> issue. In five-day talks that began Aug. 29 in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, both sides said they found common ground but achieved no breakthroughs in resolving the 10-year-old Cambodian conflict. In his speech today, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> discussions on <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> had `` contributed to improving Soviet-Chinese relations,'' according to the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency. He also called for direct talks between <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> on the issue. Since the <LOCATION> Vladivostok </LOCATION> speech, Soviet and Chinese top envoys have been meeting regularly to discuss normalization and border issues. The Kremlin's ties with <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> have been strained since the Communist giants split over ideological and strategic differences in the early 1960s. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said the people of the two countries are ready for a rapprochement. `` There is ever more goodwill and trust in relations between the Soviet and <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> peoples,'' he said. `` Their profound interest in one another has been resumed and is being filled with new content. Mutual attraction is growing.''

<HEAD>Police Investigating Disfigured Doll Placed On Actor's Doorstep</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police have questioned actress <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, who starred last year in `` No Way Out,'' about an incident in which a disfigured doll was placed on actor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>' doorstep. Officers responded to a call from <LOCATION> Woods </LOCATION> on Aug. 16 when the doll was discovered, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> police Lt. <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mancini </PERSON> said Thursday. The doll appeared to be a threat to <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> and his fiancee, <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, 25. <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>, 40, also reported receiving harassing phone calls and letters, <PERSON> Mancini </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> was questioned, but that's all I'll say about her part in the investigation,'' <PERSON> Mancini </PERSON> said. He would n't say when police interviewed the actress or whether police have questioned anyone else. No criminal complaints have been filed in the case, he said. `` One thing I really want to make clear,'' <PERSON> Mancini </PERSON> said, `` is that <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>'s participation in the investigation was completely voluntary. She was completely cooperative.'' An agent for Miss Young said it was policy not to speak with the media about its clients. <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON>, <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>' publicist, referred questions about the matter to <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>' attorney, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wertheimer </PERSON>, who did not return telephone calls for comment. Ms. <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, 28, co-starred with <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> last year in the movie `` The Boost,'' which has yet to be released. She also appeared in the 1987 <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Costner </PERSON> movie, `` No Way Out,'' playing the part of a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> mistress. <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> won an Emmy Award last year for his portrayal of the mentally ill man in `` Promise,'' featuring <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Garner </PERSON>. He also earned a best-actor Academy Award nomination for his role as a desperate journalist in 1986's `` Salvador.''

 A motion to dismiss drug-trafficking charges against <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> ruler Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has been sealed at the request of a prosecutor, who says it could influence the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidential election. But <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Sonnett </PERSON>, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s principal lawyer, on Thursday denied <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was trying to plant a political bombshell, saying the motion was routine and that prosecutors had an `` overactive imagination.'' <PERSON> Sonnett </PERSON>'s dismissal motion, filed Thursday, was ordered sealed in advance by presiding <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoeveler </PERSON> at the request of prosecutor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregorie </PERSON>. `` My concern is that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> would see this as an opportunity to put materials in there that could have some bearing on our election and might use that as some sort of blackmail to cut himself a deal with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government,'' <PERSON> Gregorie </PERSON> said Thursday. `` I want to be sure that ... this is not being used as some political tool to attempt to coerce the administration into some sort of deal,'' he said. `` It does n't matter to me who's in power. I'm a prosecutor, not a politician. I just do n't want them to play politics with it.'' <PERSON> Sonnett </PERSON> has indicated in past hearings that he would argue that the indictment should be dismissed because the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has no legal right to indict the Panamanian leader, and because <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> courts have no jurisdiction to try him. A 12-count indictment returned by a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> in February accused <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> of accepting $ 4.6 million in bribes from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s violent <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> drug cartel. A grand jury in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> indicted <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> the next day on three marijuana importation counts. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration offered in May to drop criminal charges against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> if he agreed to step down, but protracted negotiations broke down without agreement.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> says he does n't have the money to repay his former ministry's $ 52 million claim against him and others, but he says that does n't matter because he plans to win the case <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Court Judge <PERSON> Rufus </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> halted the trial Thursday and scheduled it to resume Oct. 17. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said that during the interim he will read depositions from <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and others, and defense attorneys will prepare to respond to evidence presented by <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>. Attorneys for the Fort Mill-based ministry want <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, his wife, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON>, and former aide <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> to repay money they say was lost through mismanagement of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> accounts and grossly inflated compensation. When asked outside the courthouse Thursday how he would pay if he lost the suit, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> responded: `` You ca n't get blood from a turnip. I do n't intend to lose.'' The trial, which is being held without a jury, began Monday. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said in court Thursday that <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> attorneys and the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> were wrong about the amount of money he received. `` I see figures on there -LRB- charts presented by <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> attorneys -RRB- that I ca n't recall at all, like in 1984, that $ 390,000 bonus, I ca n't recall that at all,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> testified. `` Looking at the charts in this room and the figures, and those in the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> preliminary report, compared to our research, shows so much error that proper auditing and examining must be done to obtain the truth,'' he said. He said he believes some financial records were destroyed after he left the ministry in March 1987 amid a sex and money scandal. Last week, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> had claimed he had the financing to regain <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>, which <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> has ordered sold. <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> Trustee M.C. `` Red'' <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> had called <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> the leading bidder with a $ 172 million offer until <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> could not prove he had the money. Testifying in the <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> trial this week, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> contradicted testimony that the board of directors never approved his salaries. He said his salary was set by the board, which also approved his raises. But earlier, former board member <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cookman </PERSON> testified that the board `` never ruled on salaries.'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, a former accountant and financial director at <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>, testified that he routinely warned <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> of the financial troubles the ministry was having. He said top executives received bonuses in some cases in anticipation of future donations, when there was n't money in the bank to cover the checks But <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hovis </PERSON> told <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> that the continuing financial crisis <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> experienced under <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s leadership was par for the course. `` Every ministry of this type in the nation had the same type of financial crisis,'' <PERSON> Hovis </PERSON> said. `` It goes with the territory.''

<TEXT>
 The government today mocked three escaped detainees holed up in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consulate </ORGANIZATION>, calling them failed martyrs, and it pledged to leave them alone if they left the building. But the Rev. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON>, a prominent anti-apartheid leader, said the three have `` no faith whatsoever'' in the government's pledge The prominent anti-apartheid leaders escaped to the consulate Tuesday after slipping away from police guards while undergoing physiotherapy at a hospital. Each had been held at least 14 months without trial. So far, they have spurned the government's offer to let them leave the consulate without fear of being arrested again. They are seeking assurances, possibly guaranteed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, that they will not be detained or restricted in any way if they leave. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, in a statement today, said he had told U.S. Ambassador <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> that the South African government `` was not interested'' in the activists. `` As far as I am concerned, they are merely guests of the American consul-general at the expense of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> taxpayer,'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said. `` They are deeply disappointed that they did not succeed in becoming martyrs and the fact that they will have to leave the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consulate-general with their tails between their legs, with all of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> laughing at them.'' But <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON>, who met with the activists, said they did not believe the government. `` The government is not to be trusted,'' said <PERSON> Boesek </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> of Reformed Churches. Many activists, once freed from detention, have been placed under restrictions limiting their freedom of movement and barring them from political activities. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said this would not happen in the case of the three escapees. `` There can be no intention to limit them in terms of talking to the press or their political activity,'' a <LOCATION> Botha </LOCATION> spokesmen, <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Darroll </PERSON>, told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON> said several activists, including <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Mokoena </PERSON>, head of the `` Release -LRB- <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> -RRB- Mandela Campaign'' had been placed under restrictions in the past 24 hours. `` How can we accept the word -LRB- of Minister of Law and Order <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> -RRB- when he offers to let -LRB- three detainees -RRB- walk out of here free while banning other people on the same day?'' <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON> said. The escapees are <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> <PERSON> Morobe </PERSON>, acting publicity secretary of the banned <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Valli </PERSON> <PERSON> Moosa </PERSON>, the front's acting general secretary; and <PERSON> Vusi </PERSON> <PERSON> Khanyile </PERSON>, chairman of the banned <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crisis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Morobe </LOCATION> and Khanyile are black. <PERSON> Valli </PERSON> <PERSON> Moosa </PERSON> is Indian. The activists have not indicated when or if they will leave the consulate, on the 11th floor of a <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> office building.

 The army ordered 180,000 Palestinian refugees to stay in their homes in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> today in anticipation of a general strike called by Moslem fundamentalists and PLO-linked underground leaders. In a pre-dawn firefight in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops killed three guerrillas without suffering casualties, the army said. Documents found on the bodies showed the guerrillas belonged to <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s Fatah branch of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> said. In <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, the round-the-clock curfew was imposed indefinitely on the Shati, Jabaliya, Nusseirat, Bureij, Maghazi and <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON> camps, the army and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. It came after a violent clash at the camp Thursday night in which 20 Palestinians attacked <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers with firebombs, iron chains and clubs, the army said. Troops opened fire, wounding two Palestinians, the army said. Also today, peace crusader <PERSON> Abie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> was summoned before police in the <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> suburb of <ORGANIZATION> Petah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tikva </ORGANIZATION> for an investigation into his meeting with <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, on Tuesday. <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> faces up to three years in jail for breaking an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> law banning contacts with terrorist groups. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> views the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> as a terrorist group. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said today <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> did n't understand who he was dealing with when he met <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> `` <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> is a decent and naive man, -LRB- but -RRB- the naive men do n't understand whom they are dealing with,'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON>, who returned to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> Thursday, said he did not carry a message from <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders but would request a meeting with Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> to brief them on his talks. <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> presented <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> with a peace plan calling for mutual recognition between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. After the interrogation, <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> said it had gone `` very smoothly.'' He said he argued he did not violate <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s anti-terrorist law since he met with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> to promote peace `` I believe I achieved something. I tried to ... show the world the desire for peace among the people over here,'' he said. Also today, the army said it created a special military command unit to oversee operations in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. The unit is to be headed by Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Gabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ofir </PERSON>, who vowed in comments broadcast by <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> radio: `` We will not allow the violence to become a disrupting factor.'' The <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> curfew was ordered to prevent violence during a general strike ordered by underground leaders for Saturday to mark the anniversary of the 1982 massacre of hundreds of Palestinian refugees in the <PERSON> Sabra </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Chatilla </LOCATION> camps in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> said. In <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, Islamic militants belonging to the underground group <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION>, or Zeal, painted grafitti calling on merchants to observe the strike, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> witnesses said. Among the slogans was one which read `` Death to the Jews'' in Hebrew and Arabic. Thursday was proclaimed a day of reckoning against collaborators by pro-PLO underground leaders, who ordered Palestinians to kill <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> who collaborated with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Five alleged collaborators have been slain over the past 11 days and a total of seven have been killed since the uprising began Dec. 8. At least 266 Palestinians have been killed during the nine-month-old uprising. Six Israelis also have died.

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was teased and supported about his blooper on the date of the bombing of <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, and said politicians are fair game for attacks when they screw up. Asked by a boy at <ORGANIZATION> Ygnacio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> if he did n't want to `` deck'' Democratic rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for teasing him about his error, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` We'll foul up and he'll jump on me and he'll make some mistakes and I'll jump on him. `` But the big thing is to get the issues out there so the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people can see them,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. The vice president had another slip of the tongue today when he said in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, that he favored anti-Semitism. Asked about the recent resignations of six members of his campaign committee on ethnic voters because of past alleged pro-Nazi or anti-Semitic ties, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied: `` I hope I stand for anti-bigotry, anti-Semitism, anti-racism. That is what drives me. It's one of the things that I feel very strongly about.'' Answering the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> students' questions Thursday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he expects to receive some flak for his misstatements on the campaign trial, but is hardly bothered by it. `` Once in a while you do get sore, once in a while you might get a little tense. But you know when you make a mistake like that, I expect somebody to jump on me. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hope </PERSON> did it. Did n't bother me. <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> did it, and that did n't bother me,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. The subject was first raised in a question-and-answer session at the school by a girl who shouted `` When was <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>?'' Last week in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> mistakenly said the anniversary was Sept. 7, not Dec. 7. Replying to the girl, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I'm glad you asked that question. You ever made a mistake in your life, anybody here? I know she has n't. `` But has anyone here made a mistake, ever. Come on guys,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` Now let me tell you how that happens. It's a good question, fair question. I tell you how it happens. You get a little tired from time to time. I'm glad to be here in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>,'' he joked. `` But, if you really want a serious answer to it, I remember because I fought for my country in war,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, recounting his service as a naval bomber pilot in World War II and noting that he was shot down in combat. `` So let there be no mistake about it,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I remember <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> pretty well, firsthand, and I hope we'll never have another one ...''

 Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and a team of union activists met with Interior Minister <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszcak </PERSON> today to set an agenda for talks on the future of the banned trade union. The meeting, which included at least 10 Solidarity members or advisers, marked the first time since the union was banned in 1982 that so many union activists sat down with government officials. The third encounter between <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and the government began this afternoon at an undisclosed location outside <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Jacek </PERSON> <PERSON> Ambroziak </PERSON>. `` After two meetings of our chairman alone, there is now a serious delegation,'' said senior Solidarity adviser <PERSON> Bronislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON>. The expansion of the number of participants in the talks `` is a serious step in the right direction,'' <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON> said. `` A Solidarity delegation is talking to the authorities at last.'' At least 23 people, including 11 officials led by <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> and two priests, were participating in the talks. Earlier <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said he was optimistic that broader talks with the government on Solidarity would begin soon. The comment came after <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> met for more than four hours Thursday with <PERSON> Kiszcak </PERSON>, his second meeting with Polish authorities in six years. The two agreed Thursday to continue working toward an early start of talks on <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s future with broader participation. They also agreed to expand the group of participants at today's working meeting and to agree on the topics, composition, as well as the procedure and work schedule of the later talks, the state-run news service <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> told reporters after the meeting that `` the atmosphere is encouraging'' but difficule problems remain. The government agreed to the talks and <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> moved to halt a wave of strikes last month that posed the most serious threat to the government since Solidarity was crushed in 1981. It was declared illegal a year later. Today's meeting was to include some leaders of Solidarity strikes last month as well as at least five members of the official trade union alliance OPZZ, said <PERSON> Franciszek </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciemny </PERSON>, an OPZZ spokesman. In another development, an official newspaper published an interview with <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> for the first time since the imposition of martial law in December 1981. The interview in the September issue of the monthly publication <PERSON> Konfrontacje </PERSON>, which came out Thursday, seemed to underline <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s return to official respectability and the new emphasis on considering divergent views The monthly, sponsored by the official national unity organization <ORGANIZATION> PRON </ORGANIZATION>, interviewed the Solidarity leader at his home on Sept. 1, the day a strike at the <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> shipyard led by <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> ended. `` You are the first Polish journalists from the officially published press to come to me asking for an interview since Dec. 13, 1981,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said, referring to the exact date of the martial law crackdown that suppressed Solidarity, the first independent trade union movement allowed in the Soviet bloc. `` There must be Solidarity,'' the interview quoted <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> as saying. But in it he added, `` It certainly does not have to be a carbon copy of that of 1981.''

 A version of the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Circus has begun its tour of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with Cossack horseback riders, juggling Siberian bears, Sumatran tigers, high-flying acrobats on stilts and clowns who are graduates of the official <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. At least one act in the show which opened Thursday at <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> needs to go back to school. Most of the children in the hall were invited, Pied Piper-style, to come up on stage to witness a juggler who shamelessly begged his audience for `` one more chance'' to successfully complete his bungled trick. The show begins with the <LOCATION> Chernievski </LOCATION> acrobats who do flips on tall stilts, starting out on a teeterboard and landing on a table-size mat. Spectators who go to the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Circus for the Russian bears were n't disappointed by the <PERSON> Zolkin </PERSON> family and their 12 trained animals ranging in age from 6 months to 11 years. At one high point of the act some of the bears and trainers simultaneously juggle balls with their paws and feet. Fans of trained animals also ooed and aahed while <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Pavlenko </PERSON> lackadaisically coaxed his 17 tigers through their paces, without the help of a crackling whip. In a finale which is worth waiting for _ the circus runs on for more than three hours _ <PERSON> Tamerlan </PERSON> <PERSON> Nugzarov </PERSON> and his riders sent 12 Caucasian horses galloping at full speed around the Radio City stage. The collection of 11 acts from the more than 100 local government-sponsored circuses throughout <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> is the first traveling <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Circus to tour the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 10 years.

<HEAD>Court Says EPA Need Not Recalculate Mileage Data</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A federal appeals court today struck down two previous orders that had directed the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> to recalculate automobile fuel economy ratings. The order by the full <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> here relieves the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> of any obligation to comply with the court's previous orders to recalculate the fuel economy ratings according to a method that could cost <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> millions of dollars in fines The decision today, made in a brief order by the court's 11 members, reversed a 5-5 vote taken May 17 that had upheld a 1986 ruling by a three-judge panel that the fuel standards be recalculated. In the previous vote, the court divided along bitter ideological lines over whether the Center for Auto Safety and other petitioners had standing to challenge the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s 1985 decision to relax the fuel-economy standards. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> action had lowered penalties that <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> would be assessed for failing to meet fleet-wide fuel economy standards set under the Environmental Policy and Conservation Act of 1975. The law requires manufacturers to be fined $ 5 for each tenth of a mile a car model falls short of the miles-per-gallon standard set by the EPA regulations. Manufacturers are given credits for models that surpass the standards that can be carried over to subsequent model years. The court said today that after considering the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s motion to reconsider that decision, `` we have decided that our original disposition was not an appropriate one.'' `` We now hold that as a majority of the ... court was unable to satisfy itself that the court had jurisdiction, the court should not have taken any affirmative action on the merits, including reinstatement of the panel opinion,'' the court said in an unsigned order. In May, the court had said that it would uphold the 1986 ruling but that that holding would not become a legal precedent because the circuit judges could not agree on the issue of legal standing.

Nothing could be more detrimental to this cause than to let emotion cloud our judgment.'' Meanwhile, wreath laying ceremonies were scheduled today at the <ORGANIZATION> Arlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cemetery </ORGANIZATION> in memory of POWs and MIAs from the Korean War.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> today bluntly told the 20-year-old polygamist king of this tiny mountain country that God intended a husband to have only one wife. The pontiff, who arrived from <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION> this morning, was escorted by spear-carrying warriors and soldiers with machine guns into a soccer stadium to celebrate Mass. He first was driven in the wrong direction, then slipped off a platform, without injury. Then the Mass was interrupted by the arrival of King <PERSON> Mswati </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION>, who rolled into the stadium in a <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION> limousine to the whistles of the crowd. A turret manned by a soldier with rifle and binoculars topped the altar, where a cross was stamped with a spear, shield and war ax. <PERSON> Mswati </PERSON> acceeded to the throne two years ago. He has four wives and is engaged to a fifth. `` Christians find that a monogamous marital union provides the foundation upon which to build a stable family in accordance with the original plan of God for marriage,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> told a crowd of about 10,000 people. `` Hence, any forms of disregard for the equal dignity of men and women must be seen as serious contradiction of the truth that <PERSON> Chirst </PERSON>, the king of peace, brought into the world.'' <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> sources said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> had been warned by local prelates to tread carefully before addressing the issue. King <PERSON> Mswati </PERSON>, wearing red-and-white robes and with five bird feathers decorating his head, listened expressionless to the pope's admonission At the end of the Mass, in an unscheduled breach of protocol, the king formally thanked the pope for his visit. The two met later at the royal palace. Earlier today, red-coated soldiers greeted <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> at the international airport of <LOCATION> Manzini </LOCATION>. When he arrived at the stadium, the pope's open car mistakenly drove out the gate, to the dismay of the spear-carrying warriors and <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> security men. After returning to the stadium, the pope slipped off a platform on the soggy field before climbing onto the altar. He was not injured. On Thursday, in <LOCATION> Maseru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> told about 15,000 young people at a rally to `` renounce every form of violence and hatred'' in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Organizers expected 1 million people at the rally and blamed a bloody bus hijacking, rainy winter weather and expensive accommodations _ such as $ 25-dollar-a-night tents _ for the small turnout. The pope visited the Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> <PERSON> Hospital </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION> Thursday to comfort 20 survivors of the hijacking, many still shaken from the shootout that ended their 27-hour ordeal. `` I am saddened to learn that others on their way to join me on this pilgrimage have been victims of a hijack that has caused such anguish and ended in bloodshed,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said Thursday, the day after police stormed the bus in <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION> with four hijackers and 71 hostages aboard, including nuns and schoolchildren. All four hijackers and two passengers, including a 14-year-old girl, died in the exchange of gunfire Wednesday between authorities and the hijackers, officials said. Twenty others were injured. The government said police stormed the bus after the hijackers ordered the driver to crash the vehicle through the closed gate of the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The gunman called for a return to civilian rule in <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION>. They also demanded to meet the pope, King <PERSON> Moshoeshoe </PERSON> II and the high commissioner. After his eight-hour visit to <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION> today, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> was scheduled to continue to war-torn <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, the last stop on his 10-day tour of five southern African countries. The pope also went to <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION> and made a brief unscheduled stop in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, where his plane was forced to land because of bad weather. <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION>, a country of 700,000 people wedged between <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, is a dual monarchy under the king, offically known as `` the Lion,'' and a queen mother, named the `` the Great She Elephant.'' Polygamy is permissable, although most men have only one wife. King <PERSON> Sobhuza </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, the current king's father, had more than 50 wives during his 60-year reign, which ended with his death in 1982.

 Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said today rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has `` been made over'' in an effort to win back Democratic voters who twice put President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in office. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was striking an anti-crime note on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> toured a steel plant in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, that was once headed by his grandfather and sought steelworkers' votes by saying he had more common ground with them than the Democrats. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was campaigning in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, stressing the fight against drugs and crime with an appearance at a police academy. The Democratic nominee also was expected to announce plans to expand the Drug Enforcement Administration, if elected. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was `` way over in left field'' on some issues of concern to blue-collar workers. `` These people do n't want gun control. They do favor the death penalty,'' the vice president said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> referred to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' brief ride in an M-1 tank earlier this week and said, `` You can not fool the Soviet leadership by knocking <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s defense for 10 years and riding around in a tank for 10 minutes. ... You ca n't fool the American people.'' The Republican nominee said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was modifying his positions on defense to woo back the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Democrats who could decide the election. `` He's gone to states like this, found that his message of ... cutting unilaterally on these weapons systems is not popular, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` He's coming out with policies quite different, but which ones do you believe?'' Running mate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> also assailed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> today, turning a question on his own qualifications into an attack on the Democrat's lack of foreign policy experience `` I have 12 years of experience in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. I understand national security measures, which is a very important requirement,'' the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator said in <LOCATION> Overland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>. A day earlier, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> selectively used economic statistics to charge tha <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had led <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> into a `` budgetary Three Mile Island. The Democratic nominee, initially reluctant to join the rhetorical fray, defended his state's economy as sound. Questioned about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s charges, a reticent <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told reporters joining him on a tour of fire-ravaged <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> that he would reserve comment until `` sometime next week.'' But later, the Democratic nominee chose to respond to the attacks, and cited his state's low unemployment rate _ 3 percent _ and 10 straight balanced budgets. Upon arriving in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> again, without prompting, told reporters, `` What Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has given us is a mountain of debt, record deficits, a record trade deficit and an economic future that does not bode well for the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people.'' Two days before the Summer Olympics, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a business group in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is the `` gold medal winner in the tax-and-spend competition.'' The Republican nominee added: `` Under my opponent, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> has lost _ lost _ 26,000 jobs since 1983, more than any other state in the country.'' Federal figures show that <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> has gained more than 230,000 jobs in the past five years, while losing manufacturing jobs. The text of the vice president's speech said `` manufacturing jobs,'' and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides said the campaign stands by that description. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also said that as governor, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has tried to raise taxes five times, including a $ 180 million jump in business taxes, sales taxes and personal income taxes this past summer. There have been no broad-based tax increases in <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' two terms as governor beginning in 1983, while there have been numerous tax cuts. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said correctly that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> pushed through a major tax increase in 1975 during his first term. That hike was repealed when taxpayers rebelled. `` The fact is the so-called <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> miracle is really the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> mirage. And right now that state is approaching a fiscal fiasco that might best be described as a budgetary Three Mile Island ... facing a budgetary meltdown,'' the vice president said. In <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> answered the charge, saying, `` Anybody who'd compare my state's economy with <LOCATION> Three </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> must be suffering meltdown.'' One debate the Democratic nominee refused to get involved in was the argument over whether the forest fires that have decimated the West should have been allowed to burn unchecked. `` This is n't the time to discuss what might have been or should be,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said as he toured the park. `` Everbody agrees that once the fires are out, it'll be a good time to sit down and think through exactly how we deal with this problem in the future.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, at a question-and-answer session with high school students in <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, was drawn into the question of a pardon for Iran-Contra figure <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>. `` The question is for me _ pardon imputes guilt, and therefore I have refused to speculate on this because I want to see this man have a fair trial. I hope he's found innocent. ... `` In my description anybody that shed his blood in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> with two or three purple hearts is a hero for that,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` Now did he make some mistakes? Maybe so. But you're not going to see me picking on <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>.'' One high school girl teased <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> about his verbal faux pas last week on the date of the Japanese attack on <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> _ the vice president mistakenly said the anniversary was Sept. 7, ot Dec. 7. `` When was <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>?'' she asked. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> joked about being in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> rather than <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, asked the girl if she ever made a mistake and then recalled his service as a naval bomber pilot in World War II. `` I remember <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> pretty well, firsthand, and I hope we'll never have another one ...''

<HEAD>Liberace's Ex-Lover Reportedly Linked To Canyon Murders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A man who claimed to be <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>'s lover gave evidence leading to new murder charges in a 1981 quadruple slaying for which pornographic film star <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> was acquitted, it was reported today. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorson </PERSON>, who is awaiting sentencing for a drug-related armed robbery, linked convicted cocaine dealer <PERSON> Adel </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasrallah </PERSON> to the bludgeoning attack on five people at a hillside home in exclusive <ORGANIZATION> Laurel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canyon </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported. The story cited unidentified sources familiar with the case. <PERSON> Nasrallah </PERSON>, 59, who goes by the name of <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nash </PERSON>, and his former bodyguard, <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Dewitt </PERSON> <PERSON> Diles </PERSON>, 40, were charged Sept. 8 with four counts of murder and one count of attempted murder in the case. Neither have entered pleas to the charges and both are being held without bail. If convicted, they could face the death penalty. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, king of pornographic films in the 1970s, was unsuccessfully prosecuted for the murders in 1982. He died of AIDS-related complications in March at the age of 43. <PERSON> Thorson </PERSON>, 29, is being held under tight security at the county jail while he awaits sentencing after pleading guilty to the armed robbery. When the charges against <PERSON> Nash </PERSON> and <PERSON> Diles </PERSON> were filed, deputy district attorney <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON> said new witnesses had come forward but declined to identify them or discuss the evidence. On Thursday, he refused to say whether <PERSON> Thorson </PERSON> will be called to testify against <PERSON> Nash </PERSON>. <PERSON> Thorson </PERSON>'s attorney in the robbery case, deputy public defender <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreyfuss </PERSON>, also declined to comment. The Times quoted sources as saying that <PERSON> Thorson </PERSON>, who lived with <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> and served as the pianist's chauffeur, secretary and, by his own account, his lover from 1977 until 1982, also maintained a close relationship with <PERSON> Nash </PERSON> during much of that period. `` <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> was <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>'s cocaine connection,'' the newspaper quoted one source as saying. According to testimony at <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>' 1982 trial, the porn star once told <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> police that he had led killers to a home in <ORGANIZATION> Laurel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canyon </ORGANIZATION> at the request of <PERSON> Nash </PERSON>, who prosecutors said wanted revenge because he had been robbed two days earlier. Four people were bludgeoned to death. The fifth survived but was unable to identify her attackers. <PERSON> Thorson </PERSON> filed a highly publicized lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> Liberace </ORGANIZATION> in 1982, in which he contended that the entertainer, who never acknowledged being a homosexual, had reneged on promises to support him for the rest of his life. The suit was settled out of court shortly before <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> died of AIDS in 1987.

<TEXT>
 Republican vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said today his experience in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and understand of national security issues qualify him for high office, and that his youth should not be any barrier. Addressing the suburban <ORGANIZATION> Overland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> before campaigning in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator also joked that his campaign managers sometimes try to hide him from the public when things go wrong. `` Sometimes they tell you to go to your room,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` And with some of the comments that I've made, I've been told that several times. It's no fun sitting alone in your room.'' Dealing with the issue of his fitness to serve as vice president, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said: `` I have 12 years of experience in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. I understand national security measures, which is a very important requirement. A lot has been made about my age and that 41 is too young. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was about my age when he ran for president.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was 43 when he beat <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> for the presidency in 1960. At <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on Thursday, at his first news conference in two weeks, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said that the voters eventually `` will see the real <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, what he stands for,'' and make up their own minds. He dismissed as `` irrelevant'' questions about his past, such as his college performance and why he did not make public his academic records. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has said he did not want reporters scrutinizing his less than stellar grades. `` <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> was not a great student,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` He was a great leader. FDR -LRB- <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> -RRB- failed the bar examination a number of times. He turned out to be a great president.'' According to biographies, <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> entered <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in 1904, a year after graduating from <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>. He took and passed the bar examination in 1907 and left <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> that year before receiving a degree. Referring to controversies over his military service during the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> War, his academic performance and his personal life, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he was `` not going to focus on what I have done in the past'' but on `` what I stand for, what I articulate to the American people.'' `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people will judge me on what I am saying and what I have done in the last 12 years in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he was not worried about a poll this week indicating that a substantial portion of likely voters have reservations about his credentials to serve in high office. A <ORGANIZATION> CBS-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll found that one-third of those responding said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was qualified to be president compared with three-fifths who said the same of his Democratic counterpart, Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` I think it's fair to say that in the last few weeks, the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people have been told a different story about <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> than what <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has tried to communicate to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people,'' he said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was asked to explain his comment last week that <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was no different from other Soviet leaders and that his perestroika policy of economic restructuring was `` nothing more than refined Stalinism.'' `` I have a hunch that restructuring in fact is to make sure that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> gets his people into the political system and the people who are not supporting him, out,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` That is classic Stalinism. That's the way <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> ran the country.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was asked how he would finance such costly proposals as modernizing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> strategic nuclear missiles and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Star Wars plan for a space-based missile defense system at a time of steep budget deficits `` There will be some tough choices,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> replied. He said defense budget increases would have to be limited to 1 percent to 2 percent above inflation over the next two to five years.

 A group of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Republicans charged today that Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> appointed three `` anti-Israeli, pro-Palestinian'' members to the party's ruling body and challenged him to dismiss them The challenge was a clear effort to counter problems in the campaign of <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has dumped eight campaign advisers in the past week following charges of anti-Semitism against them. Rep. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Lent </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said the three objectionable members were appointed to the 400-member <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> following the party's July convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> as a gesture of conciliation to defeated presidential contender <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. He identified the three as the Rev. <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrow </PERSON>, executive director of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s Chicago-based Operation PUSH; <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> city councilman and close <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> associate; and <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Skaff </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, whom he said is a spokeswoman for the pro-Palestinian Ad <ORGANIZATION> Hoc </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committtee </ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Lent said <PERSON> Barrow </PERSON> and <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> are supporters of radical <PERSON> Muslim </PERSON> leader <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON>, who has made anti-Semitic statements. He said <PERSON> Skaff </PERSON> has led anti-Israel demonstrations. `` The presence of -LRB- the three -RRB- on the Democratic team raises questions about <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' judgment and his submission to <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>,'' Lent said at a news conference. `` Obviously, Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has failed to grasp the message his appointments send.'' Lent said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had acted quickly to clean house when similar allegations were raised about members of an ethnic coaliton supporting his campaign and when it was reported that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> adviser <PERSON> Frederic </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> made a count of Jews in key jobs at the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> in 1971. `` It's time for <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to show that he truly is in charge,'' Lent said. `` He is the nominee of his party and should have control over the party structure.'' Appearing with Lent were Reps. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, R-Wash., <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Molinari </PERSON>, R-N.Y. and <PERSON> Vin </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Minn </LOCATION>. Another Republican member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, Sen. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Boschwitz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, told reporters he had turned down a request from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign aides take part in the `` I do n't want to do it,'' <PERSON> Boschwitz </PERSON>, a prominent Jewish politican. `` I do n't think there's any political future in these charges and countercharges.'' Two of the three <ORGANIZATION> DNC </ORGANIZATION> members under attack, <PERSON> Skaff </PERSON> and <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>, defended their stance on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Barrow </PERSON> could not be reached immediately for comment. `` Attacking individuals such as myself and Rev. <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrow </PERSON> and Councilman <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> is a desperate and dangerous move by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign,'' said <PERSON> Skaff </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> coordinator for the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. `` Targeting me as an Arab-American, and targeting my views on this issue truly endangers the political security of Americans of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> heritage. Am I guilty of crime because my grandparents came from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>?'' she said. <PERSON> Skaff </PERSON> said she favors an independent Palestinian state, but only `` premised upon the security of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' And she said that she has always condemned terrorism, but recognizes the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> because Palestinians have themselves chosen the group as their representative. <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> was criticized in 1985 when he refused to sign a newspaper ad condemning anti-Semitic remarks attributed to <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON>, leader of the Nation of Islam. <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> said Thursday he was unaware of the Farrakhan remarks at the time and that he would gladly sign any letter opposing anti-Semitic remarks. `` I'm very disappointed in someone in the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> camp who would take something as serious as relationships between blacks and Jews and exacerbate them for political gain,'' he said. <PERSON> Barrow </PERSON> was quoted in a 1985 article in the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> as saying, `` I love my brother, Minister <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON>. The devil do n't like it, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> do n't like it, the world do n't like it, but we love it.'' She said Thursday she was praising <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON>'s role in encouraging economic development in black communities at a meeting held to discuss that development. She said she supports a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> homeland, along with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> security. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign could not immediately be reached for comment. A spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Diamond </PERSON>, said that body had no immediate comment.

 <LOCATION> THE </LOCATION> <LOCATION> HAGUE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> _ <LOCATION> Dutch </LOCATION> soldiers who say their drill sergeants beat or bullied them now can call a toll-free telephone number to complain, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. The 24-hour-a-day hot line is the government's latest move to protect its 50,000 conscripts and 56,000 professional military, whose rights already encompass labor unions, a 40-hour work week and the right to adopt any hair style that does n't interfere with their duties. The line opened Thursday and is manned round the clock by a team of social workers. `` We're definitely not looking for calls from people who say ` I want to go visit my granny this weekend but they wo n't let me,''' a ministry spokesman said on condition of anonymity. He said the ministry will investigate complaints ranging from violent behavior and sexual abuse to bullying by superiors and other soldiers.

 A Hungarian court sentenced 10 people to jail for smuggling Romanians and East Germans through <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> to the West, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. It said the group charged up to $ 11,100 for taking Romanians out of their country into <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, then driving them across <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and smuggling them over the Austrian border. For a smaller fee, East Germans who traveled visa-free to <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> were smuggled into <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and then across to <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> said. It said the ring was exposed after Hungarian border guards found the escapees in trucks at the crossing to <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> said a West German identified only as <PERSON> Siegfried </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwanke </PERSON> appealed his five-year sentence and had it reduced Thursday to four years. He will be expelled when the term is served, it said. Four Hungarians were sentenced to 2 -LCB- years in jail, a fine and loss of their driving licence for two years, and five unidentified defendants have begun serving lighter jail terms, <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> said.

 The Nicaraguan Contras have accepted a <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> offer to hold preliminary talks in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on Monday to end the conflict in the Central American country and have set up meetings today with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Congressional leaders. `` We hope we can achieve a breakthrough and create momentum,'' <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> <PERSON> Matamoros </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Contra rebels who oppose <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Marxist government, said Thursday. He said the resistance had urged the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> to then proceed to high-level talks Sept. 26-28 in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> or the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Matamoros </PERSON> said the Nicaraguan government would have to free all remaining political prisoners and permit `` freedom of expression'' for negotiations to succeed. It was not clear whether this amounted to the Contras setting conditions and whether they would be acceptable to the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. In the meantime, Contra leaders planned separate meetings on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> with Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wight </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, and House Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. `` We are concerned there be an adequate climate, and we ask the government of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to remove these obstacles,'' <PERSON> Matamoros </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s vice minister of foreign affairs, had been notified in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> of the Contras' acceptance of the preliminary meeting. At the same time, <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION> stressed it was up to the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> `` to create a favorable climate for a round of negotiations at the high level'' to work out a peaceful settlement. Negotiations between the two sides broke down in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> in June after 11 weeks in a dispute over whether the steps demanded by the Contras were part of a Central American peace plan. The Sandinistas say the negotiations collapsed because of last-minute Contra demands over what were essentially domestic political issues. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> met Wednesday with resistance leaders. <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION> and a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said the decision to accept the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> offer for a preliminary meeting was made independently by the resistance group. Asked if the preliminary talks would lead to high-level negotiations and a settlement, the official said, `` It depends on the Sandinistas'' and whether they were willing to release arrested demonstrators and lift restrictions on <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> and a Roman Catholic radio station. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration repeatedly has called on <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> for political reforms while urging <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to finance arms and other support for the Contras who are fighting to bring down the leftist government.

 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, saying the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administation has short-changed the war on drugs, promised today he would double the number of federal drug agents and hire more federal prosecutors. `` We are going to give state and local law enforcement officers the money to fight the war,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in remarks prepared for delivery at the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're not going to try to nickel and dime you to death, as this administation has done,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said that as president he would double the number of federal Drug Enforcement Administation officials over five years. Aides to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he was prepared to spend $ 50 million to hire 600 new agents next year toward the goal of 2,800 new agents. He said he would put 100 of those new agents in southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, where he was campaigning today. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign said the candidate was committed to hiring 800 more federal prosecutors to help handle drug cases and other crimes. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ridiculed remarks by Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> two days ago in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, quoting <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as saying he is `` almost haunted'' by severe drug problems in inner cities. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, `` American children do not need our pity. They need strong leaders and first rate law enforcement officers ... They do n't need a change of heart in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. They need a change of leadership.'' On Thursday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> traveled to the charred forests of Yellowstone National Park to show support for firefighters. Standing across a river gorge from a blackened hillside, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> refused to be drawn into the debate in the West over whether the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration should have acted sooner. Following National Park Service policy, the government allowed those fires that were ignited naturally to burn themselves out until late July. `` This is n't the time to discuss what might have been or should be,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` Everybody agrees that once the fires are out, it'll be a good time to sit down and think through exactly how we deal with this problem in the future.'' The Democratic nominee, putting aside his newly aggressive demeanor for a moment, sounded nearly as cautious when asked about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s assault on his economic record as governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> _ an area <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> made the centerpiece of his candidacy. `` I'll be responding to that sometime next week,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said at first. `` ... Good luck to Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the Republican nominee, said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' state led in spending increases and was second in tax increases under his administrations and called him `` the gold medal winner in he tax-and-spend competition.'' Several minutes later, appearing to reconsider the notion of allowing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s charges to go unanswered, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> delivered a response without prompting. Arriving in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> later, he again volunteered a reaction. `` We've balanced 10 budgets in a row, we have a 3 percent unemployment rate, we have more jobs than people to fill them, personal income is rising at the second fastest rate in the nation, and we've cut taxes five times in the last five yearrs,'' he said. `` What Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has given us is a mountain of debt, record deficits, and record trade deficts, and an economic future which does not bode well for the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people.'' The issue of when to battle forest fires has produced divisions in the <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> states and poses political pitfalls. Interior Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> has suggested the policy may be changed. But the policy of letting fires burn themselves out unless they threaten lives or structures has won support from some environmentalists, who argue that fire is a natural process that makes way for new growth. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he wanted to hear more about the issue, but he recognized that argument. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has campaigned in the <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> states and, at the height of his midsummer popularity, aides were speaking hopefully of the nominee's chances in those states _ especially <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. But as the race has tightened everywhere, the <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> states _ which have been reliably Republican in presidential races even though they elect Democratic state officials _ are looking increasingly difficult for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Greenhouse Effect May Worsen Hurricanes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hurricanes of the future may be even more powerful than any that have come before, as a result of the so-called greenhouse effect warming of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, a scientist is warning. <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Emanuel </PERSON>, of the meteorology department at <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, expressed his concern even as Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, perhaps the most powerful tropical storm of the century, was churning a path of destruction through the Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Because hurricanes gain their energy from the warm ocean waters in tropical areas, rising temperatures could increase the strength of these storms in the future, he explained in a telephone interview. `` Over the warmest parts of the oceans, a change in sea-surface temperature of 1 degree Celsius -LRB- 1.6 degrees Fahrenheit -RRB- will change the minimum sustainable pressure in a hurricane by 15 to 20'' millibars, <PERSON> Emanuel </PERSON> reported. The pressure in the center of a hurricane is generally considered a good indication of its strength, with lower pressures indicating a more powerful storm. Normal sea level pressure is 1,013 millibars, while in a powerful storms like <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> readings can drop into the high 800s. <PERSON> Emanuel </PERSON> commented, however, that it's too soon to tell whether <PERSON> Hurricane </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> is a product of the greenhouse warming. `` This is kind of an extraordinary hurricane, but I do n't think we can take it as an indication we are seeing any kind of trend,'' he said. `` If the predictions of some climate models come true, and that's a pretty big if, we can expect to see some more intense hurricanes in 50 years or so.'' That means the strong storms of the future would be more powerful than the strong ones of today, he explained, although there would n't necessarily be more storms. There generally seems to be a limit to how low the pressure can fall in even the strongest storms, explained <PERSON> Emanuel </PERSON>, but warmer ocean waters could lower that limit. And that, he said, is what could result in the stronger storms. The greenhouse effect has been widely reported in recent years. Climate experts explain it as the result of increasing carbon dioxide and other polluting gases in the atmosphere. Those gases allow the incoming sunlight to continue to warm the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, but block some outgoing radiation, leading to a gradual increase in the planet's temperature. It is a situation similar to that of a greenhouse where heat from the sun is captured to warm plants. Studies by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> concluded that carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased by 25 percent since the mid-1800s and continues to grow. Scientists have estimated that the overall temperature of the Earth has risen by more than 1 degree Fahrenheit over the same time, and could rise by another 2 degrees over the next few decades. Computerized models, using complex mathematical formulas to predict the result of such a warming, have warned of a variety of dire consequences ranging from drought over croplands to melting of the polar ice caps, raising sea levels and inundating coastal communities. <PERSON> Emanuel </PERSON> is the author of a study, `` Toward a General Theory of Hurricanes,'' which appears in the July-August edition of American Scientist. In it he noted that while many things about the giant tropical storms remain a mystery, in recent years scientists have come to a better understanding of the storms. The power for hurricanes, he explained, comes from the transfer of moisture and energy from the oceans into the overlying air. This air rises, forming a low pressure area, and wind from surrounding area begins blowing in a spiral toward that center, bringing in more moisture from the warm ocean. Since the rate of evaporation increases with wind speed, the faster the wind the more water and energy it can pick up in the storm. The inward-flowing air can not get to the actual center of the storm because the laws of physics would cause it to increase its spin to an infinite velocity, <PERSON> Emanuel </PERSON> explains. Thus, at some point, the wind stops moving inward and begins to ascend, forming the well-known cloudy eye-wall of a hurricane. Because ocean heat drives these big storms, scientists have found that among the conditions necessary before a hurricane can form is an ocean temperature of 26 degrees Celsius _ about 82 degrees Fahrenheit _ and that warm water needs to extend down about 60 meters, or 165 feet. In addition, the storms will not form if there are strong cross winds, which disrupt the rising motion that helps form the center of the storms.

<TEXT>
 Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said today that Democratic rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is a campaign convert on defense issues who is trying to fool <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> voters _ and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> leaders _ by `` riding around in a tank for 10 minutes.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said photographs of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> wearing a military helmet and riding in an M-1 tank at a defense contractor's plant in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> earlier this week were at odds with his record on national defense. `` All I can do is cite his position,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, declaring that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has opposed the railroad-based MX missile, the Midgetman missile and the B-1 bomber. `` Now suddenly he rides around in a tank, jumps out of the tank, takes off the helmet and comes on with different positions,'' the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee said as he toured the <ORGANIZATION> Buckeye </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> plant in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> under the silent gaze of steelworkers, some wearing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> T-shirts. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> opposes the MX and Midgetman missile programs and initially expressed opposition to the B-1 bomber, although he said later that production of the aircraft should be allowed to proceed. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was encouraged by the reception he received from the steelworkers at the plant where his grandfather, <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, was once president. About 150 employees stood quietly throughout the speech, neither jeering nor applauding. `` Admittedly, the applause meter did n't go off the chart,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` nor did the boo meter go off the chart. These days we measure things by both meters.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was `` way over in left field'' on some issues of concern to blue-collar workers. `` These people do n't want gun control. They do favor the death penalty,'' the vice president said. In Findlay, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, a city that calls itself `` <LOCATION> Flag </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared that `` the flag is back'' and then seemed to stumble into the Pledge of Allegiance. At a flag-draped rally, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` What is it all about? It's the symbol of these <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and to the liberty for which it stands, one nation under God with freedom and justice for all And let's never forget it.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is tailoring his message in an effort gain the support of Democrats voters who previously had voted for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` He's gone to states like this, found that his message of ... cutting unilaterally on these weapons systems is not popular, and so now he's been made over,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` He's coming out with policies quite different, but which ones do you believe? You believe this 30-day conversion as you climb out of a tank?'' The vice president added: `` The tanks did not fit. It's time to take another message to <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>. It's very straightforward. You can not fool the Soviet leadership by knocking <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s defense for 10 years and riding around in a tank for 10 minutes. ... You ca n't fool the American people.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also made an apparent misstatement, saying he stands for anti-Semitism, when asked about the resignation of six pro-Bush campaign aides on ethnic groups who allegedly had pro-Nazi or anti-Semitic ties. He said the aides left voluntarily to avoid diverting attention from campaign issues. `` I hope I stand for anti-bigotry, anti-Semitism, anti-racism,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` That is what drives me. It's one of the things that I feel very strongly about.'' The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee said in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on Thursday that he hoped former White House aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> would be exonerated of all charges stemming from his role in the Iran-Contra affair. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> refused to rule out a presidential pardon if North is found guilty. And today, he ducked a question whether he would offer North a job in any <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stopped in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> on his return to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> after a two-day campaign swing through <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> highlighted by a statistical assault on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as an Olympic-class `` tax-and-spend'' governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. Trying to project a disastrous <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy under a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> administration, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor had presided over a state that lost 26,000 jobs since 1983. The text of the speech said `` manufacturing jobs,'' but <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> skipped over the word. Press Secretary <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> said the omission was inadvertent. Official figures also show that under <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the state's job market as a whole has seen a five-year increase of 230,000 jobs to more than offset the loss of manufacturing jobs. On another point, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> in the last two years `` has turned a surplus into a growing budget deficit that according to Massachussetts legislators appears to be approaching $ 500 to $ 700 million for fiscal 1989.'' In fact, the state has no deficit now, and <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> said the vice president was only referring to the future projected deficit. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> in fiscal 1988 had a $ 67 million surplus after cutting $ 450 million in spending and dipping into some reserve accounts. Critics questioned the surplus and said it could only be the result of tax and fee increases, government borrowing and a `` raid'' on the state pension fund. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also noted that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has borrowed about $ 200 million a month since June for operations, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called it `` last-ditch borrowing.'' But <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says the short-term loans are needed to cover municipal aid that is now dispensed in a lump sum annually instead of in periodic installments as was the case before 1986, and that helps the local municipalities avoid heavy borrowing while waiting for state aid. On taxes, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> listed <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> as second in the nation in growth in per capita taxes since 1963. That means taxes are higher per person than in any state but <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. But it is not due to a tax hike by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> economics adviser <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON> acknowledged. In fact there have been no broad-based tax increases in <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' two terms that began in 1983 Tax revenues went way up due to growth in income and other economic factors, <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON> said, adding that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> criticism is that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> let the taxes rise without instituting any relief for taxpayers. `` He's allowed them to rise without returning them,'' to taxpayers or seeking tax limitation measures as other states have done, said <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON>. There have been numerous tax cuts during <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' last two terms.

 Firefighters battling wildfires contended with higher winds today and looked forward to an approaching Canadian cold front expected to bring showers and cooler temperatures to burning woodlands this weekend. On Thursday, presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> gave crews at fire-blackened <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> a pep talk and expressed awe at nature's devastation. `` I ca n't remember a year in my lifetime when the weather seemed to be more important to us in many ways,'' the 55-year-old Democrat said during his tour of the park. `` The drought, the heat, and now a massive hurricane bearing down on us are reminding us not only of our mortality but of the importance of pulling together and caring for each other,'' the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said. Blazes burned today in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state as the worst fire season in 30 years continued. More than 4 million acres, including 2.1 million acres in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, have gone up in smoke. The 8,400 soldiers and civilian firefighters in drought-parched <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> got a break this week from cooler, calmer weather, but Park Superintendent <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbee </PERSON> said, `` We're not out of the woods yet.'' Firefighters continued to beef up protection of areas that could be threatened if conditions worsened. Efforts Thursday focused on <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>, which could be threatened by a 335,000-acre fire, said fire information officer <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Valen </PERSON>. Winds kicked up today and were expected to hit 20 to 35 mph, but the forecast contained some good news: a Canadian cold front bearing cool, rainy weather was expected to reach <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> by Sunday. The wind will `` definitely make increased fire activity, but we do n't anticipate any runs like we had last weekend,'' said park spokeswoman <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> toured <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> with the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> governors of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. `` I know I speak for every single American citizen when I tell you we are grateful to you and I know you have been taking on what is a massive undertaking,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told firefighters, adding he was `` awestruck by what's happened here.'' The fires, which now form one huge blaze, have affected 1.1 million acres of the 2.2 million-acre park. But according to new infrared scans, they have burned only about 50 to 60 percent of the land within fire perimeters. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> refused to be drawn into the debate over whether the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration should have acted sooner. Following National Park Service policy, the government allowed naturally ignited fires to burn until July. The other governors agreed that the Park Service should have attacked the fires sooner because of this year's dry conditions, said <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Romer </PERSON>. Interior Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> has said the `` let-burn'' policy may be changed. In west-central <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> today, a battalion of 540 soldiers from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state were on fire lines, relieving weary firefighters mopping up the smoldering 247,000-acre Canyon Creek fire. `` It looks real good. The forecast is for additional precipitation. In fact, it's showering here right now,'' fire information officer <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kendley </PERSON> said today. In Glacier National Park near the Canadian border, winds and temperatures in the 80s kept nearly 1,000 firefighters busy. Officials expected the fire to continue spreading east today as shifting winds gust to 25 mph, said fire information officer <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Payne </PERSON>. `` We've got a sleeping giant that's tied down pretty well, except he's trying to wiggle free on the northeast side,'' <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> said today. The fire grew by about 2,000 acres overnight to 34,500 acres. The approaching Canadian cold front may bring rain to the area this weekend, or even snow at higher elevations, forecasters said. `` We're all hoping for snow tomorrow, every one of us,'' said spokeswoman <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibert </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, about 300,000 acres of forest fires continued to burn. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, officials said land in the eastern section of the state would be reopened to the public this weekend due to gains made against wildfires. A ban on hunting and fishing was to be lifted at midnight tonight, and statewide bans on logging were relaxed. In <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, 14 more fire crews were ordered into the struggle against a blaze in <ORGANIZATION> Willamette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, boosting the force to more than 1,600 firefighters and support crews. Hot, windy weather was predicted this weekend. Infrared aerial photographs taken Thursday night put the fire at 7,232 acres, an increase of 882 acres over the previous night. `` The main objective is to hit the fire hard the next two to three days, before the east winds move in,'' <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Lorette </PERSON> <PERSON> Laferriere </PERSON> said. `` We expect more dry weather and east winds along about Sunday or Monday.''

 The first USO club is moving due to fewer customers and a less than `` wholesome environment'' for the military, officials said. The Bob Hope USO club, which opened in 1940 and became a spot where soldiers rubbed elbows with stars, is moving to <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> in December, with a satellite club in <LOCATION> Barstow </LOCATION>. `` That's where the military is,'' <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Milkes </PERSON>, the organization's executive director, said Thursday `` We decided to take <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> to the mountain.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Hollywood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USO </ORGANIZATION> club was a model for the chain of <ORGANIZATION> USO </ORGANIZATION> clubs chartered by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1941 to serve the military overseas. At its height, the <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> center attracted up to 25,000 servicemen a year, Ms. <PERSON> Milkes </PERSON> said.

Its two new locations are accessible to 60,000 military personnel, she said. Not everyone in <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> is pleased with the move. `` It's going to kill the rest of the businesses downtown,'' complained <PERSON> Marcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamb </PERSON>, co-owner of Overreact Gallery, an art gallery across the street from the new USO site. `` We're trying to develop a community feeling and a reputation for a certain consistent type of nighttime entertainment.'' But Ms. <PERSON> Milkes </PERSON> said such fears are based on outdated perceptions. `` Those who object are carrying around an image of drunken sailors from the past,'' she said.

 While <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> followed the destructive path of Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> this week, he recalled the 1935 hurricane that claimed 50 relatives when it blasted the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION> with 200 mph wind and a 15-foot wall of water. `` I've been following this thing and I know the 1935 hurricane was tougher _ no maybe about that,'' said <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, who lost his mother, three sisters, grandparents, aunts, uncles, nephews and cousins in the Labor Day hurricane, one of only two Category 5 hurricanes to make <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> landfall since record-keeping began. `` When I see the pictures from <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, you can see tall coconut palm trees still standing. There was n't one left on my island _ only stumps,'' <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, 69, said by telephone Thursday from his daughter's home in <LOCATION> Frostproof </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> was a Category 4 storm when it devastated <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> this week, then strengthened to Category 5, which signifies sustained wind speed greater than 155 mph and interior barometric pressure less than 27.17 inches and other factors After crossing <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> had declined to Category 3 on its way to landfall near the Texas-Mexican border Friday. It had killed more than 50 people. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, then 17, was in the center of the 1935 hurricane's 14-mile-wide swath that destroyed a railroad, peeled the <ORGANIZATION> Matecumbe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Keys </ORGANIZATION> down to bare rock and killed 600, 408 in the Keys The retired carpenter still lives at <LOCATION> Islamorada </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Matecumbe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheets </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hurricane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> at its peak was bigger in size and stronger in barometric pressure than the one that struck Sept. 2, 1935, although the earlier one was more powerful when it struck land. The other Category 5 hurricane to make <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> landfall was <PERSON> Camille </PERSON>, which killed 256 in the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> coastal area in 1969. In an interview at the time of the 50-year anniversary of the Keys hurricane, <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> relived the giant storm that was forecast to move into the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Straits </LOCATION> between <LOCATION> Key </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. But after a morning of sunshine, winds became ferocious and heavy rain fell. What was known then as the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Weather Bureau was unaware the hurricane had changed course. `` At 8 p.m., it got so black you could n't see your hand in front of your face,'' <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> said. He and his family sought refuge in a nearby building. `` The building began to shake and muddy water came in under the door. My father said we'd have to leave the building. He told us to grab hold of each other and try to hang together. `` We opened the back door and became separated. I was holding onto my sisters and nephews, but we were pulled apart,'' he said. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> grabbed the door frame as the building toppled. `` There was debris everywhere. It was a boiling pot. The water rose quickly and my leg got caught. I stretched my neck and cupped my hands over my mouth as the water got higher. `` I heard a voice in the distance and I kept yelling at the person to keep yelling. Later, I worked down the pile of trash and my face pushed into something. It was my father; the voice I heard in the distance, he had been only an arm's length away.'' `` One of my cousins was found 40 miles from here,'' recalled <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>. `` She was still holding her baby in her arms.''

 A state-owned jetliner carrying 104 people ran into a flock of birds, crashed and burst into flames shortly after takeoff, killing at least 31 people, the airline and sources said Friday. Thirty more people were injured and two people were missing in the accident Thursday near <LOCATION> Bahar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dar </LOCATION>, close to the source of the <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tana </ORGANIZATION>'s southern shore in <LOCATION> Gojam </LOCATION> province in the northwest. The Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737, which originated in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>, was on a scheduled domestic flight when a flock of birds was sucked into both engines after it took off from <LOCATION> Bahar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> airport </LOCATION>, the airline said in a statement. The pilot tried to turn the plane back to <PERSON> Bahar </PERSON> <PERSON> Dar </PERSON>, but failed and crashed into marshy ground 14 miles south of the airport. The plane skidded on its belly for about 500 yards before the fusilage broke into two, the airline said. Sources said the craft immediately burst into flames. Seventy-one people escaped from the burning wreckage, 12 of them seriously injured and 18 with minor injuries, the airline and the sources said. The seriously injured were rushed to a hospital in <LOCATION> Bahar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dar </LOCATION> while those with minor injuries were flown to <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION> for treatment Friday, sources said. It was the first statement to confirm fatalities in the crash and the only official word since the Marxist government announced the accident Thursday evening and said `` the majority'' of the people on board the plane were safe. The airline did not issue a list of passengers or their nationalities, but it was believed most of the people on the plane were Ethiopian. The flight was on a scheduled run from <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION> to <PERSON> Bahar </PERSON> <PERSON> Dar </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Asmara </LOCATION>, the capital of northern <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> province. A civil aviation official said birds have long been a problem at the <LOCATION> Bahar </LOCATION> Dar airport. <PERSON> Bahar </PERSON> <PERSON> Dar </PERSON> is 200 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION> and 280 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Asmara </LOCATION>. It sits on the southern shores of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tana </LOCATION>, the source of the <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nile </ORGANIZATION>. The Blue Nile courses west out of the <LOCATION> Ethiopian </LOCATION> highlands into <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, where it joins the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nile </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> and continues on to the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> as the Nile River.

<HEAD>Senate Democrats Proposing to Expand Subminimum Wage for Students</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> offered Friday to expand slightly an existing subminimum wage for full-time students to head off what they called a `` hire'em and fire'em'' 90-day training wage backed by Republicans. Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., offered an amendment to his bill raising the minimum wage from its current $ 3.35 an hour to $ 4.55 an hour by 1991 that would allow employers to hire up to 12 students instead of the six now allowed for up to 20 hours a week at 85 percent of the minimum wage Only about 100,000 students are now earning the $ 2.85 subminimum wage, according to <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials, compared with 515,000 students in 1978. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said his proposal would allow employers to double the number of students at the subminimum wage on their payrolls. The tactic was aimed at heading off a Republican amendment by Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> to establish an 80 percent training wage for newly hired workers for up to 90 days. <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> indicated that Republicans were unwilling to vote Friday on <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s student wage, putting off the key <ORGANIZATION> Republican-Democratic </ORGANIZATION> showdown on the politically volatile minimum wage issue until next week, eight weeks before the November election. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, R-Ind., <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate, in the past have all conditioned any increase in the minimum wage to a massive expansion of the subminimum wage <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, campaigning in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, refused again Friday to specify how big of an increase in the minimum wage he favored. `` I do n't know how much of an increase,'' he said, but repeated that any upward adjustment should be coupled with a differential for a lower training wage. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, silent on the subject in recent days, offered an amendment while the bill was still in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in June to couple a minimum wage increase to $ 4 an hour over two years with a subminimum training wage. The amendment was never voted on. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> complained none of the Republican training wage proposals require employers to provide any training. He said the real purpose was to give employers a `` windfall'' lower wage in jobs that have turnover rates of up to 400 percent a year. `` Who honestly believes that it takes three months for someone to learn to mop a floor or change the sheets on a bed?'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. `` This is a pure and simple wage cut.'' He said the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> proposal would provide employers with a powerful incentive to `` throw working families out on the street once every 90 days'' and replace them with a new force of trainees. `` This is the hire'em and fire'em wage, maybe we can call it the churn'em and burn'em wage,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. `` The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> push will turn <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s working people into vagabonds and gypsies, thrown from job to job every three months. Can this be what <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> means when he talks about a kinder, gentler <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>?'' <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> called <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s counterproposal for an expansion of the currently allowed student waivers a `` not really very effective bureaucratic way of doing things.'' `` The purpose of the training wage is not to help full-time students,'' <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said. `` The purpose is to open the door of opportunity for those who have nothing, who are under-educated, unskilled.'' <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> cited various studies estimating that increasing the minimum wage would cause the loss of between 200,000 and 800,000 new jobs over the next three years. `` The reason 16 million new jobs _ 12 million of them at $ 10 an hour or more _ have been created -LRB- since 1981 -RRB- is because we have n't had an increase in the minimum wage,'' he said The federally mandated wage floor has been frozen at $ 3.35 since January 1981, the longest time in its 50-year history without an increase. Meanwhile, its purchasing power has dropped 30 percent to $ 2.60 measured in today's dollars. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s bill would raise by 40-cent increments each year to $ 3.75 in 1989, $ 4.15 in 1989 and $ 4.55 in 1990 _ a total of 35.8 percent over the three years. It also would increase the exemption for small businesses from the current threshold of $ 362,000 in gross sales to $ 500,000. According to <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> figures, about 6.7 million workers were paid the minimum wage or less in 1986. But the bill also would directly benefit 11.5 million other workers earning between $ 3.35 and $ 4.50. House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, D-Tex., said Friday that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is awaiting <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> action before considering the issue `` The likelihood is we'll take it up, vote, pass it,'' he said.

<HEAD>Doctor Says Deaver Suffered Memory Impairment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A doctor who treated <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> for alcoholism testified Friday that the former presidential aide suffered memory impairment when he took tranquilizers during hospital treatment for the disease. Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said the combination of alcohol withdrawal and heavy doses of the tranqilizer Valium impaired <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON>'s judgment and memory during a 1985 hospital stay `` He was n't really processing or dealing with things in an appropriate manner,'' said <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>, head of the alcoholism clinic at <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> testified at a court hearing on <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON>'s medical condition. Defense lawyers are trying to convince <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Penfield </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> that <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON>'s alcoholism is a mitigating factor that should be taken into consideration when <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> is sentenced next week for three perjury convictions. The former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> deputy chief of staff was convicted last December of three counts of lying to a federal grand jury and a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee by saying he could n't recall contacting government officials on behalf of high-paying lobbying clients. <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON>, 50, faces a possible five-year prison term and a $ 6,800 fine for each of the three convictions. Sentencing is scheduled for Sept. 23. The defense contends <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> was n't lying in 1986 when he testified he could n't recall telephoning then-Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> from his hospital bed on June 3, 1985, on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>, who also treated <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> for alcoholism in October 1986, testified that the former presidential aide had reduced mental functions during the detoxification treatments. `` Do you believe under the circumstances that his judgment was impaired in any way?'' defense lawyer <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Turk </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>. `` I would say definitely,'' <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said. `` And his memory?'' <PERSON> Turk </PERSON> continued. `` Definitely,'' the doctor replied. Later, <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said he noted impairment of <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON>'s `` memory of the kinds of things that were happening to him'' during the three-day hospital stay. But the doctor also said that throughout the visit, <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> `` remained quite alert and never showed any signs of depression or any signs of heavy sedation'' while he took large doses of Valium. <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> has remained sober since undergoing a month-long treatment in 1986 at a clinic. The medical testimony was not offered during <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON>'s trial because the defense rested without calling any witnesses. The presentation during a two-day hearing that began Thursday appeared to be as much an attempt to put <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON>'s defense on the record for an appellate court as it is to persuade <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to impose a lenient sentence. The defense is expected to argue on appeal that rulings <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> made during the trial last year made it impossible for <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> to put on a defense. During the trial, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> refused to strike from the indictment certain allegations of perjury left unproven at the close of the prosecution's case. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> ruled that he would keep these elements of the case intact until after the close of the defense case, giving the prosecution an opportunity to prove those points when questioning <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> or other defense witnesses. The defense then rested without calling any witnesses, including <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> or medical experts who could testify about how alcohol impaired his memory. Independent counsel <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> argued Thursday that the medical records would show no evidence of a memory loss. <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> contended that <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> chose to remember some things and forget others when he testified under oath in 1986 during the investigations of his lobbying for possible ethics-law violations. <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> insisted on checking out of the hospital after his first visit sooner than doctors thought advisable and refused to enter a treatment program. `` He was adamant he did n't need further treatment. He would handle this himself,'' <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said. At this point <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> had not really faced up to the fact that he was an alcoholic, even though <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said he thought the former presidential aide had been drinking heavily for several years. `` He was the kind of alcoholic who had been very successful at hiding from a large number of people his alcoholism,'' <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON>'s family was not told of his problem until shortly before his first hospitalization. When he returned for treatment in October 1986, <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> again resisted going into a clinic, <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said. But after some encouragement by his family and advice from his lawyers, <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> agreed to enter an alcoholism rehabilitation center in Havre de Grace, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official urged a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on Friday to reject `` ill-conceived'' legislation to compensate some cancer victims among southwestern uranium miners and people who lived downwind of 1950s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> atomic tests in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. `` The bill does not require that causation between exposure to radiation and cancer be established or that any legal theory of liability on the part of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> be proven,'' said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Valentine </PERSON>, deputy assistant attorney general in the department's civil division Valentine, restating opposition voiced by <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> officials for more than a decade, said the department does not believe a link has been proven between radiation and cancers in miners and people receiving fallout from the atmospheric weapons tests. `` The assumptions underlying this ill-conceived proposal are either subject to serious dispute or demonstrably erroneous,'' said <PERSON> Valentine </PERSON>, adding that the department would recommend a veto of legislation being pushed by lawmakers from <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> to compensate victims or their survivors. `` I am incredulous,'' responded Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D-Mass., chairman of the Judiciary subcommittee on administrative law and government relations <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said radiation victim compensation `` will be high on the -LRB- subcommittee's -RRB- agenda next year. It wo n't go away. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s hearing centered on bills introduced by Rep. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Utah </LOCATION>, and Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, to pay compensation similar to what <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has voted in recent years to military people who participated in the tests and to <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islanders </ORGANIZATION> injured by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear tests in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. Their proposal would give $ 50,000 each to people who lived in a designated downwind area of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> during the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> tests and who developed cancers that studies show had a high probability of being caused by the radiation. Payments of $ 100,000 each would go to people who worked for minimum periods in underground uranium mines in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> between 1949 and 1971 and who developed lung cancer and other respiratory problems. The lawmakers say the legislation is needed because a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> appeals court has overturned a circuit court ruling that awarded damages to some 1,200 downwind residents on grounds that the government had failed to warn them of the tests' dangers. <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, who as a private attorney represented some of the plaintiffs, said that he also has had personal experience with health problems of former miners. `` Last year, my brother-in-law died from lung cancer,'' <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> testified. `` He worked in the Marysvale uranium mine in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> for less than six months _ a healthy man who never smoked a single cigarette in his life dies from lung cancer.'' <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> said payments to the miners are justified because the government knew of high levels of radiation in the mines but failed to warn the miners or force the mine owners to install proper ventilating equipment. `` The government demonstrated a reckless disregard for the lives of these uranium miners,'' he testified. `` The uranium miners became mere guinea pigs in a government death watch.'' <PERSON> Arden </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, who worked in the <LOCATION> Marysvale </LOCATION> mine from 1953 to 1959, told the subcommittee that although he never smoked, he lost his right lung to cancer in 1983. `` I've watched my partners and my friends die of lung cancer,'' <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> said. `` It seems that each year another one dies.'' He said federal inspectors took radioactivity readings in the mine and that physicians tested the workers. `` They never mentioned once what the radiation was doing to us,'' he said. `` They told us we were all right.''

<HEAD>Increased Business Inventories Suggests Economic Growth</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Business inventories in July rose at the slowest rate in 11 months, the government said Friday, suggesting to analysts that underlying economic growth remains strong despite a pause in business sales. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said inventories rose 0.3 percent to a seasonally adjusted $ 733.7 billion. It was the 19th consecutive gain, but the smallest since a 0.2 percent increase in August 1987. Economists sometimes take rising inventories as a sign of weakness, fearing that too many goods piling up on shelves and backlots will trigger production cutbacks and layoffs at factories. However, they point out that the buildup over the last year and a half has been trong sales, despite a dip in July. `` The key thing to me is that inventories are remaining very moderate, accompanied by s so basically the implication is for strong third and fourth quarter growth,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wescott </PERSON>, chief economist of <ORGANIZATION> Alphametrics </ORGANIZATION>, a consulting firm in <PERSON> Bala </PERSON> <PERSON> Cynwyd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>. Business sales fell 0.2 percent in July to $ 487.7 billion, the first decline since November when some buyers were spooked by the October stock market crash However, the slight drop followed a very strong 1.4 percent jump in June, the second best in more than a year. `` When you put June anl relatively active. The cone-shaped dwellings date back more than a century. She planted metal spikes into the ground that will show future researchers where the huts are, even if everything above ground is later burned away. `` The fire has n't hit them yet, but there's a good chance they may,'' she said. `` That's a resource that very well could be lost in fire activity, but they -LRB- the wickiups -RRB- have been recorded.'' At one point this summer, another cluster of wickiups in the northwestern corner of <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> was threatened. `` But the plans people -LRB- firefighting strategists -RRB- were ready to protect them,'' <PERSON> Capek </PERSON> said. As the fire approached the dwellings, she notified the fire command of their existence and precautions were taken. In many cases, archaeologists will have to wait until the fires abate before they can learn what happened to historical sites. For example, <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, a park naturalist and historian, said he could not say whether the flames had claimed trees that early park explorers initialed, or ones bearing rope burns made when <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troops chased Chief <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> and his <LOCATION> Nez </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Perce </LOCATION> tribe in 1877, winching their wagons down a steep slope. <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> also wondered about the fate of trees along <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s southern boundary that bore markings by the first surveyors of <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> Paradoxically, the fires can be beneficial to archaeologists in one way, in burning away thick undergrowth that hides `` lithic scatters'' _ arrowheads, primitive stone tools and spear points in the ground that would not be damaged by fire, <PERSON> Capek </PERSON> said. Though fear continues about sites that existed before <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> became a park _ it was authorized in 1872 _ the park's more modern structures have fared better Some decades-old cabins have burned, but the park's five federally designated landmarks _ the Old Faithful Inn, the Madison Museum, the <ORGANIZATION> Norris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION>, the log canopy over the northeast entrance gate and the Fishing Bridge Museum _ all have escaped the flames. Also spared was the Queen's Laundry, a bathhouse dating to the 1880s that was one of the first federally funded structures built in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Capek </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Building Collapse That Killed 28 Sparks New Safety Rules</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal officials are proposing new rules aimed at preventing disasters like last year's collapse of an apartment building that killed 28 construction workers. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s proposed rules may not be implemented until next summer, after the administration evaluates comment on the plan The proposal applies only to lift-slab techniques, which were being used when the partially completed L'Ambiance Plaza collapsed. The technique is a seldom-used method in which concrete floor slabs are poured on the ground, one on top of the other. After the slabs are cured, they are jacked upwards along vertical steel columns, then fastened at their proper levels. An <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> official, <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gurnham </PERSON>, said the rules clarify the requirement that all non-essential workers be cleared from a lift-slab building while the floors are being lifted. The rule always has been in effect, but was interpreted by workers and managers to mean that construction crews could work below a floor that was fastened. <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> officials previously assumed that a permanent floor above the workers would break the fall of a higher concrete floor that slipped and fell. Other portions of the new rules would require that a `` qualified designer'' design lift-slab projects. Also, the rules say that all jacks lifting the floors should be able to lift 2.5 times the weight expected to be applied and all slabs should be lifted in a level position.

The book, prepared by the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marxism-Leninism </ORGANIZATION> of the party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, coincides with the centennial of <PERSON> Bukharin </PERSON>'s birth. The collection includes articles and comments on communist theory and party politics, economic policy and culture, the official news agency said. <PERSON> Bukharin </PERSON> was a `` distinguished social scientist whose name and writings have for long been unfairly buried in oblivion,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. In February, <PERSON> Bukharin </PERSON> was cleared of spying charges for which he was shot in 1938. The party readmitted him posthumously in July. The rehabilitation was part of a review launched by Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> of party officials killed or arrested by <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bukharin </PERSON>, an economist, favored moderate economic policies that are similar to those being implemented under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s program of perestroika, or restructuring. In recent months, the Soviet press has published several articles on <PERSON> Bukharin </PERSON>. The newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kultura </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday reported a lecture he delivered in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> two years before he was shot.

 The condition of admitted pipe bomb killer and forger <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Hofmann </PERSON> was upgraded Friday from critical to serious and stable following a prison drug overdose, but police still could not interview him. `` He has improved considerably overnight. His pulse, blood pressure and heart rate are all stable,'' said <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dwan </PERSON>. `` He's waking up, coming out of the coma. He is only able to whisper at this time, but he appears to be oriented, and he's following medical instructions.'' Officers were called to <PERSON> Hofmann </PERSON>'s cell Thursday by his cellmate, who could not wake him up for lunch. <PERSON> Hofmann </PERSON> initially was reported in critical and unstable condition following what <PERSON> Dwan </PERSON> said was an overdose of an undetermined anti-depressant drug. <PERSON> Hofmann </PERSON> was sentenced to five years to life after pleading guilty in January 1987 to having planted pipe bombs that killed <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON>, a documents collector, and <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheets </PERSON>, wife of <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON> associate <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheets </PERSON>, on Oct. 15, 1985. At a January hearing, the state <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pardons </ORGANIZATION> told him he would spend the rest of his life in prison. <PERSON> Hofmann </PERSON>, 33, confessed that he killed <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON> and Sheets to cover up his career as a forger of historical documents, many of which he sold to the <ORGANIZATION> Mormon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Dwan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hofmann </PERSON> was gradually regaining consciousness Friday and was taken off a respirator, but was in no condition to be interrogated. `` He's still not lucid,'' <PERSON> Dwan </PERSON> said. `` Our medical personnel have had to sedate him twice for medical purposes.'' Armed corrections officers, supplemented by hospital security and university police, guarded the door to <PERSON> Hofmann </PERSON>'s room and entrances to the intensive-care unit. Corrections spokesman <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Benavidez </PERSON> said prison officials were concerned the overdose might have been a prelude to an escape attempt, although investigators had no hard evidence of that. <PERSON> Dwan </PERSON> said the security was for <PERSON> Hofmann </PERSON>'s safety, too. `` We've received a couple calls here already from people saying ` Why do n't you just let him die,' and so forth,'' he said. `` They're here to make sure he does n't escape, but also that no one bothers him.'' <PERSON> Hofmann </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Doralee </PERSON>, recently filed for divorce and <PERSON> Hofmann </PERSON> signed a consent form about five week ago. He spoke with her and his children by telephone Wednesday but gave no indication anything was amiss, prison officials said. He had been on administrative lockdown, confined to his cell 23 hours a day, since a purported <PERSON> Hofmann </PERSON> plot against <ORGANIZATION> Pardons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> members was uncovered. His attorney, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Yengich </PERSON>, has denied such a plot existed.

 Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>'s leading edge lashed the coast and its 120 mph winds swirled toward landfall today, as officials in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> tallied billions in damage from the giant storm blamed for at least 58 deaths. Thousands of residents along <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' 370-mile coast, many evacuated to higher ground after piling sandbags in the doorways of their homes and boarding up windows, huddled in shelters and waited for the news: When and where would <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> hit? `` We are going to sit and wait and pray for the best,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, director of transportation for <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, where officials estimated that as much as one-fourth of the city of 110,000 could end up in emergency shelters. By Thursday evening, <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Isabel </ORGANIZATION>, a city of about 5,000 just east of <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, was a virtual ghost town. Officials also evacuated the coastal resorts of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Padre </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION>. More than a half dozen tornadoes accompanying the hurricane hit the <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> area today in advance of the center of the storm, blowing over at least two homes and injuring one person, a boy who suffered a minor head wound. Scattered flooding was reported. Police were ordered to leave <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Padre </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> when water began flooding the causeway to the mainland. The city had asked everyone to leave the island but police Chief <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> said he had heard that about 10 to 15 residents remained there overnight. An estimated 25,000 people evacuated low-lying villages in southern <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and officials said they would n't let people return home until they were sure <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> had run ashore elsewhere. A <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> helicopter today rescued five people from a fishing boat near Port Isabel and the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> sent a search and rescue boat after seven people on a boat in <LOCATION> Matagorda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. The boat was found beached with no one aboard, and officials were searching along the coast for the occupants. By early today, the storm had weakened since its destructive assault on the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, and despite forecasters' predictions <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> showed little sign of strengthening as it headed for the area around <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> at the southern tip of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` It has not strengthened since it left <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, but we still believe some strengthening is possible. It's not ever going to get back up to Category 5 strength with 175 mph winds, but it very possibly could reach 130 or 140 mph,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gross </PERSON>, a hurricane specialist at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hurricane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. The Hurricane Center said if <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> continued in the same direction, the eye of the storm would come ashore near the <LOCATION> Texas-Mexico </LOCATION> border sometime this evening. According to a rough estimate, the eye of the hurricane will hit the coast between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m., about 50 to 60 miles south of <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrovich </PERSON>, a weather service forecaster in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. Winds gusting up to 60 mph, accompanied by rain and squalls, began pounding <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> today as preview of the fury of <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, which has left at least 58 dead, $ 8 billion in damage and more than half a million homeless on several <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> islands and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> issued a hurricane warning for <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s northern coast and the southern half of the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> coast from <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> O'Connor </LOCATION>, including 250,000-resident <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>. A hurricane watch remained in effect for the remainder of the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> coast, from <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> O'Connor north to <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arthur </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. At 2 p.m. CDT, the storm center was near latitude 24 north, longitude 97.1 west, or about 130 miles south-southeast of <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, moving northwest at 12 mph, with maximum sustained winds of 120 mph and accompanied by a 10 - to 15-inch rainfall Under state law, <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> officials could not order people to evacuate their homes, but police Sgt. Dean <PERSON> Poos </PERSON> noted, `` Where are you going to put 100,000 people anyway?'' `` We have all kinds of people here, from those that need Pampers, to those that need wheelchairs,'' said <PERSON> Ersel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantz </PERSON>, who was heading the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> effort at the city's civic auditorium. Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> dispatched <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> units to <LOCATION> McAllen </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> and <PERSON> Corpus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christi </PERSON>. `` In terms of preparations, there's really nothing left to be done,'' said <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Oestrich </PERSON>, assistant <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> chapter manager in <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>. `` We're doing what we do _ taking care of people.'' <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, city manager of <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>, said 12 to 15 evacuation centers are full, with a total of 26 to be set up if necessary. `` I think we're ready. What you do for a hurricane is you do n't manage it; you just kind of endure it,'' he said today on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Morning In <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, a city of 280,000 on the northeastern <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> border across from <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, thousands of people crowded into shelters set up at schools, churches and public buildings after the hurricane left 17 dead in the <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>. On the island city of <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION>, scene of the worst natural disaster in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history when a hurricane hit in 1900, killing 6,000, about 40 percent of the island's 65,000 residents were evacuated by early today, said <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> public information officer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON>. To the north in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> all but shut down Thursday, with most of its 9,000 employees sent home to prepare for <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>. And in south <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, 25,000 people fled the most vulnerable villages despite being out of the high-danger area. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>'s sustained winds have died down from 175 mph in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> to 120 mph after it passed over Yucatan on Wednesday. Its ranking was lowered from Category 5 _ the most fierce _ to a Category 3. The storm's earlier landfalls left at least 26 people dead in <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, five in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> and 10 in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>. In addition, a 3-year-old <LOCATION> Rockport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, boy drowned early today after falling off his family's shrimp boat as it was being moved to safe mooring. <LOCATION> Calhoun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's office spokesman <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Prush </PERSON> said the boy's death was indirectly related to <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>.

<HEAD>GOP Congressmen Say Three Democratic Panelists are Anti-Israeli</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A group of Republican congressmen sought to defuse charges of anti-semitism in the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> campaign by charging Friday that Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> appointed three `` anti-Israeli, pro-Palestinian'' members to the party's ruling body. Rep. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Lent </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said the three objectionable members were appointed to the 400-member <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> after the pention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> as a concession to defeated presidential contender <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` The presence of -LRB- the three -RRB- on the Democratic team raises questions about <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' judgmentarty's July conv and his submission to <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>,'' Lent told a news conference. `` Obviously, Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has failed to grasp the message his appointments send,'' said Lent, challenging <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to force the resignations of the three. Lent identified them as the Rev. <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrow </PERSON>, executive director of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s Chicago-based Operation PUSH; <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> city councilman and close <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> associate; and <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Skaff </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, whom he said is a spokeswoman for the pro-Palestinian Ad <ORGANIZATION> Hoc </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committtee </ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.

 Former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON> said Friday the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> should use fewer consultants, but he strongly defended his tenure against criticism arising from the current <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> bribery investigation. `` The changes that we made in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> procurement system were deep and fundamental,'' <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` I do not believe that any of the changes that we made could by their nature increase the incidence of improper behavior.'' <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON> resigned last year after leading the naval build-up that was a key part of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s defense program. But the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is now the center of a bribery investigation by federal prosecutors, who are looking at allegations of payoffs and bribes from consultants, many of whom were former <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> employees. The consultants were seeking information from <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials about details of contracts, information that could make the difference in winning multi-million dollar contracts. No charges have yet been filed. A key figure of the investigation is <PERSON> Melvyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>, the former assistant <ORGANIZATION> navy </ORGANIZATION> secretary for research and engineering and a close associate of <LOCATION> Lehman </LOCATION> during their <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> tenure. <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> resigned and became a high-priced consultant shortly after <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON> quit to take a Wall Street job in April, 1987. <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON>'s testimony to the committee was his first major public comment since the investigation became public three months ago. <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON> declined to talk about details of the investigation and committee members did not ask him for specifics because they did not want to affect the probe. <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON> noted the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has more consultants than the other services, chiefly because the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has fewer officers. Consultants do work for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> performed by officers in the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, he said. But `` I was never comfortable with the dependence on consultants,'' <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON> said, detailing what he said were generally unsuccessful efforts to reduce the number of consultants. `` Consultants are essential, but we do have too many,'' he said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> could substantially reduce its reliance on consultants.'' Two reforms suggested in the wake of the investigation are requiring consultants to register, and requiring them to disclose all their contracts to prevent conflicts of interest. <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON> endorsed those changes. The combative former official also strongly defended changes he made during his tenure. Some critics have suggested the changes, such as more centralized management and elimination of some layers of bureaucracy, caused the climate which led to the investigation. `` With regard to strong centralized policy-making, and decentralized execution, I see no way that either principle increases the opportunity for waste, fraud and abuse,'' he said. `` I am very proud of the achievements made in rebuilding the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> during my tenure,'' he said. `` I do believe the changes that led to that success made the system by its nature more susceptible to waste, fraud, and abuse.'' Overall, said <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON>, the Pentagon should be reorganized to give much more authority for daily decisions to lower-level personnel, rather than top officials. He opposed the creation of a single purchasing `` czar,'' a change proposed by some legislators. `` In rough book value, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> equals the top 30 companies on the Fortune 500 list combined,'' he said. `` And yet the Pentagon is organized in theory like a small business, with all operational authority and decision-making drawn up in one centralized office.'' He proposed that the secretary of defense simply make policy, and turn all other major decisions over to the three services. The staff should also be reduced by half, he said, and that goal could be easily achieved. `` Normal attrition in the military and civil service is about 8 percent per year, so careful use of hiring freezes brings a rapid natural shrinkage,'' he said. `` Increased opportunity for voluntary early retirement with pensions or large severance payments would enable a new administration to cut the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> bureaucracy by 30 percent in three years without firing a single person.''

<HEAD>Business Leaders Criticize Administration's Lack of AIDS

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is to blame for a lack of coordinated leadership in the nation's fight against the AIDS epidemic, several business leaders said Friday at a conference on the deadly disease. `` The simple truth is that the President has a moral and probably constitutional imperative to trigger <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s best defense from this plague. He has failed,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbits </PERSON>, executive vice president of corporate development for <ORGANIZATION> Joseph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> E. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seagram </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Sons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Individual government agencies, such as the federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>, have made great strides against AIDS, said Dr. <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a pharmaceutical manufacturer. But `` there is no leadership thrust in the government as a whole'' to coordinate AIDS research developments and public policy proposals, said <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, who chaired the national <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AIDS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oversight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Leslye </PERSON> <PERSON> Arsht </PERSON>, the White House public information officer assigned to answer AIDS policy questions, was in a meeting Friday afternoon and not immediately available for comment, a receptionist said. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> called on the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to recreate a central presidential commission on AIDS to coordinate policy and research. <PERSON> Herbits </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> were among more than a dozen leaders from business, labor and government who spoke at the conference sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> on AIDS, based in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The conference was aimed at spurring greater corporate leadership in the national war on AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, a fatal, incurable disease that destroys the body's ability to fight sickness. `` The absence of our leadership will convince other community leaders that this is not really an important problem,'' <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Herbits </PERSON>, who was a special assistant in the White House and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> before joining <ORGANIZATION> Seagrams </ORGANIZATION> in 1977, said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> failed to make AIDS a top priority. `` In seven State of the Union speeches, Mr. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> stood before our nation and never even mentioned that AIDS exists,'' <PERSON> Herbits </PERSON> said in a speech prepared for the conference. `` Each year until this, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> doubled the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's request for funds dedicated to the fight on AIDS. `` Yet, the administration still underspent its appropriation,'' he said. `` The administration is still taking too long to approve drugs for experimental therapies and still delays approval of contracts to search for appropiate therapies for those who already have the virus.'' As of this week, 72,766 AIDS cases have been reported to the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>; 41,064 people, or 56 percent, are dead. While AIDS still primarily afflicts homosexuals and intravenous drug users, a <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> official estimates that 5 percent of the cases were spread by heterosexual contact.

 Schools and factories closed Friday as thousands of Armenians staged a strike to renew their call for annexation of a disputed region in neighboring <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, an activist said. <PERSON> Hovik </PERSON> <PERSON> Vassilyan </PERSON> said 150,000 people demonstrated on a main square in the Armenian capital to support a work stoppage that started Monday in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, the disputed region in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. The strike in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, populated mostly by Armenians, is scheduled to end Sunday, <PERSON> Vassilyan </PERSON> said. `` People are everywhere,'' said <PERSON> Vassilyan </PERSON>, a former political prisoner and the editor of an unsanctioned Armenian nationalist journal. He spoke by telephone from <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>. The Armenians are demanding that <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> be removed from the control of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> and become part of the Armenian republic. The region has been part of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> since 1923. Armenians, who are predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION>, claim economic, cultural and religious discrimination under the rule of Azerbaijanis, most of whom are Moslem. In July, central authorities in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> rejected the demand to turn <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> over to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and instead mandated economic and social improvements to the region. Armenians first started agitating for control over <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> in February with street demonstrations and strikes. At least 32 people were killed in rioting related to the dispute in the Azerbaijani city of <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION>.

 A police cruiser responding to a call struck four pedestrians on Friday, the second time this week that people were hit by a police car. <PERSON> Jenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Romeo </PERSON>, 74, of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, was in critical condition at <LOCATION> Kings </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, with a fractured pelvis and a fracture to the right side of her neck, hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Leah </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Ralichstien </PERSON>, 71, of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, was in stable condition with bruises from his knees to his feet on both legs, Ms. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. The others were treated and released, she said. The two police officers in the cruiser were treated for trauma at <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. They were identified by police as <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Malley </PERSON>, 27, the driver, and <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 34. Friday's incident occurred shortly after 8:30 a.m., when the cruiser, which had been parked in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, received a call of a man with a gun nearby. As the officers were driving to investigate, <PERSON> O'Malley </PERSON>'s foot slipped from the brake, onto the accelerator and then became wedged between the pedals, according to police spokesman Officer <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Llanes </PERSON>. The car accelerated and struck the pedestrians as they crossed a street, <PERSON> Llanes </PERSON> said. <PERSON> O'Malley </PERSON> stopped the car using his left foot on the brake pedal, the spokesman said. On Sunday, a cruiser struck two girls during a 68-block chase that began when the officers tried to stop car for a traffic violation. One suffered a head injury, and the other suffered two broken legs.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Friday reducing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomatic presence in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> would not harm efforts to stem the flow of drugs into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We're concerned right now about some of our people there and I think that this is just a measure we're taking and probably temporary,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. About half of the 160 diplomatic posts in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, including some at the regional <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, are to be vacated, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said.

This has left many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats in the country with little to do. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said `` there have been some threats against mission personnel'' and that the administration wanted to reduce their `` vulnerabilities.'' The cutback was recommended by Ambassador <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and has been under way since last spring. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said it would be completed unless Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> received `` appeals'' from other agencies and decided in their favor. Other offices that may be closed or severely reduced are the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was asked if the cutback would hamper anti-drug efforts while he was having his photograph taken with <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> in the Oval Office. `` No, I do n't think we're doing anything to reduce our ability to interdict drugs,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> replied. Three <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials stressed, meanwhile, there would be no reduction in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Southern Command or in the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, `` We're doing it because the lessons of history have taught us that when we are in a potentially confrontational situation, it makes sense to reduce potential vulnerability,'' one of the officials said Thursday night. After all, he said, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was trying to get rid of the head of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s armed forces, Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the effective leader of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, has been indicted on drug trafficking charges by federal grand juries in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. He has successfully countered all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to drive him out. These included cancellation of all normal dealings with the country. The prohibition is so extensive American diplomats are even forbidden to apply for a renewal of their automobile license plates. Despite persistent reports that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was on the ropes, the general has held on while <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, who had <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> backing to succeed <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, was ousted in February by the pro-Noriega <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. Administration sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said some of the extra <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> security personnel sent to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> last spring by the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> would be withdrawn gradually. According to an official of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, 240 cases of harassment of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen were reported between February and August. The command has about 10,000 American servicemen stationed in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> permanently and a like number of military dependents. Referring to the diplomats, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said `` we are reducing the vulnerabilities inherent in having a large number of <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government personnel living and working in areas dominated by the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> regime.''

 Insurgents who have fought the government for four decades say they are throwing their support behind the massive anti-government campaign and want to be included in any interim leadership formed to restore democracy. Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets of the capital again Friday, demanding the resignation of President <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>'s one-party government. Many gathered later in the day outside the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> to listen to speeches and songs about democracy, a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> diplomat said. The crowd also chanted slogans demanding an interim administration be formed to return democracy to this impoverished Southeast Asian nation, he said. `` We support 100 percent the struggles for democracy,'' said <PERSON> Brang </PERSON> <PERSON> Seng </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Kachin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is also our aim to replace one-party dictatorship with multiparty democracy.'' He said the group supports the demand for an interim government and opposes the government holding general elections. <LOCATION> Brang </LOCATION> Seng spoke Thursday night in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. `` Inclusion of representatives from the revolutionary forces -LRB- rebels -RRB- in the interim government should be considered for future deliberations for internal peace,'' he said. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported the administration pr3 and the party named hardliner <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> his successor. <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> resigned 17 days later after rioting killed at least 112 people in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>.

 Most of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s postal workers were back on their jobs Friday sorting a backlog of 150 million pieces of mail that piled up during a two-week nationwide strike, officials said. All but 20,000 of the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>'s 180,000 employees returned to work after the strike, which was settled Monday, officials said. Most postal employees in <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> _ the two cities that process one-third of <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> mail _ returned to work late Thursday. Mail was loaded on trains across the country, said <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitt </PERSON>, a Post Office spokesman. But he said it will take two weeks to clear the backlog. <PERSON> Fitt </PERSON> said 69 of the country's 82 major sorting offices were operating Friday, and international mail service also was to resume. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communication </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> staged a 24-hour walkout on Aug. 31 to protest regional pay bonuses, then stayed off the job to protest the hiring of temporary workers to handle the one-day backlog.

The regional pay dispute concerned bonuses the post office wanted to pay to new workers in southeast <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, where a high cost of living makes recruitment difficult. The union said it wanted the bonuses paid nationally or not at all.

 <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc has proposed a `` war game'' to test the rival <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s claim that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> could surrender some of the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> without undermining its security. The former defense minister issued the challenge in a letter Thursday to the pro-Labor Council for Peace and Security. His office released the letter Friday. The council, a group of retired military officers, contends <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s defense would be enhanced, not compromised, if it surrendered occupied land in exchange for peace with the Arabs. As defense minister, <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> was the architect of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s much-criticized 1982 invasion of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, aimed at ending cross-border attacks from the Arab state In the letter, <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> proposed a public debate followed by `` a war game in which we will test, again in public, the different military strategic concepts concerning the defense of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, now <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s commerce minister and a high-ranking member of Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, called for the confrontations before the national elections Nov. 1. `` The public should see for itself and make its own judgment,'' he said. National security and the future of the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> have become central issues in the election campaign. The executive committee of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> met Friday to consider <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>'s proposal and will respond in the next several days, said <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Amirav </PERSON>, secretary of the group. A <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> aide said that before the war game, research institutes would be asked to define <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> positions and strengths. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>'s team then would `` defend'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from within current boundaries, including the occupied territories, while the council would have to `` defend'' from a more limited land area The <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> has consistently opposed any land-for-peace plans and has stressed keeping the territories to strengthen security against invasion from neighboring Arab states. The leftist <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, led by Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, has favored compromise. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has occupied the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> since the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. Palestinians launched an uprising in the territories Dec. 8 to try to end Israeli rule. Since then more than 260 Palestinians have died, mostly in clashes with Israeli security forces. Six Israelis also have died. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gat </LOCATION>, international secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, accused <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> of preposing `` a <PERSON> David </PERSON> and Goliath show for media purposes.'' He said if the debate and war game were held, `` Mr. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> would come out empty because his solutions are not well based.'' <PERSON> Uri </PERSON> <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> aide, said the minister would probably lead his own team in any debate and mock battles. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, a retired major general, sees such activities as a way to take politics out of the issues. Another possible contender in the proposed games would be the Officers and Academics for Security and Peace, a group of pro-Likud retired officers organized to counter the activities of the Council for Peace and Security. But <PERSON> Yehoshua </PERSON> <PERSON> Saguy </PERSON>, a founding member of the pro-Likud group, was cool to the idea of a war game. `` A game is a game is a game,'' <PERSON> Saguy </PERSON> said. `` Other elements are important, such as how to measure the possibilities of coming to compromise with <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> or the Palestinians and strategic questions.''

<HEAD>Newspaper Says It Has Located Girl Who May Be Natural Daughter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A newspaper has located a girl who may be the daughter of a couple suing a hospital for $ 100 million because, they claim, their healthy newborn was swapped for a sickly infant 9 -LCB- years ago. Reporters, using public records, found the blue-eyed girl in the <LOCATION> southwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> city where she lives with her father, the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petersburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. She is the only other white girl reported born at tiny <ORGANIZATION> Hardee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> at the time the plaintiff gave birth, the Times said. To protect the child, the paper did not identify her. <PERSON> Regina </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Twigg </PERSON> sued in federal court in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> last week, accusing three doctors and a nurse at the <LOCATION> Wauchula </LOCATION> hospital of keeping their biological child, a healthy baby born Dec. 2, 1978. The suit contends the Twiggs were instead given a sickly infant. That child, <PERSON> Arlena </PERSON>, died Aug. 23 after a long battle with a heart problem. The Twiggs say blood tests performed at <LOCATION> Johns </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hopkins </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> shortly before <PERSON> Arlena </PERSON>'s death prove that the child they raised was not their biological daughter. They claim personnel at <ORGANIZATION> Hardee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> swapped infants in order to give away or sell the real baby <PERSON> Twigg </PERSON> and then altered the hospital's records to hide their actions. <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellin </PERSON>, attorney for the <PERSON> Twiggs </PERSON>, said he hopes to locate the girl found by the newspaper and determine if her blood matches the Twiggs' O-type blood. `` If she's O-positive and shows any family resemblance to the <PERSON> Twiggs </PERSON>, it's going to be incredible,'' he said. `` We would like for the child to know that we in fact did not give her away,'' <PERSON> Twigg </PERSON> said. `` We would want her to know that we would like to have her. But if she is happy ... we may feel differently about it.'' The girl's family dismisses the idea that she could be the <PERSON> Twiggs </PERSON>' biological daughter. `` My sympathy goes out to those people,'' the girl's father told the Times. `` They have every right to pursue their real child. -LRB- My daughter -RRB- is not their child ... she will never be their child.'' The Times did not indicate whether the girl was adopted or if the man's late wife had given birth at Hardee Memorial. The man told the newspaper he knew nothing of any baby swap. He would not disclose his daughter's blood type and said he would resist attempts to draw the girl into the Twiggs' battle. The girl knows nothing of the search. `` Until they get an indictment or a conviction ... I have nothing to say,'' he said. `` I'm an innocent bystander.'' Besides Mrs. <PERSON> Twigg </PERSON>, records show only one other white woman gave birth to a girl during the two weeks before Mrs. <PERSON> Twigg </PERSON>'s discharge from <ORGANIZATION> Hardee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION>, according to <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Boorde </PERSON>, state registrar for vital statistics. The legal mother of that girl died in March 1981 when the child was 2. Two months after the woman's death, her husband married a worker he met in the hospital where his wife had been treated. That marriage ended in divorce last December. The girl was immature for her age and had troubles in school, but was loving, the ex-wife told the Times. `` She lost a mother and she knew me as a mother for seven years and then lost me. What's next? the woman said.

<HEAD>Bush Attacks Show Weaknesses And Strengths Of Dukakis Economic
Record</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s assault on <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' fiscal record renews a debate over statistics that are generally favorable to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> but show some holes in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' economic rebound. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> struck at the heart of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' candidacy _ his stewardship of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> during its economic boom _ with a speech Thursday that selectively used statistics to point out chinks in the state financial record but that also gave a misleading characterization of the state's tax picture. `` You can pretty much do what you want with selected statistics,'' said <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodeling </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' Department of Revenue `` If you wanted to call day night you could probably find a statistic to support that.'' An obvious example is jobs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> cited the state's loss of 26,000 manufacturing jobs since 1983. State officials have put the number closer to 100,000 but they also cite a net gain of more than 400,000 jobs since 1983. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> spending increased between 1983 and 1987 at a rate faster than any other state, and that tax increases in that period were second only to <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> administration officials did not dispute <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s assertion on spending State budgets have grown by nearly $ 1 billion a year since 1983, fueled by soaring state revenues. Much of the increased spending has been in the form of aid to cities and towns hurt by a voter-approved property tax cap and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's decision to halt revenue sharing with municipalities. On the tax side, however, administration officials denounced <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s figures, which do not take into account the record increase in per-capita income in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> over the four-year period the vice president cited. During that period state taxes have been cut several times, including the repeal of a surtax <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> authored in 1975, his first year as governor. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> initially opposed most of the tax cuts. `` -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB- chose the per capita figures because they appear to show that taxes went up,'' said <PERSON> Hodeling </PERSON>. `` What they fail to show is that people here are making a lot more money so of course they are paying more taxes. Percentage-wise, taxes have been cut.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> cited the surtax to support his position that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was the biggest tax raiser in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> history; <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> sought the increase to erase a $ 600 million deficit inherited from his Republican predecessor. `` There are probably a zillion ways to measure taxes,'' said <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Republican Leader <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, who met with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in July to discuss state finances. `` In any political campaign you have charges and countercharges and statistics can be used to support a variety of things.'' The vice president chided <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for approving $ 7.4 billion in long-term borrowing for capital projects during his tenure and for not fully funding the state's pension system. However, Wall Street's two major bond rating agencies recently termed <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' long-term debt moderate compared to many states and said its economy appeared strong enough to support the debt. And it was <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> who last year convinced the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> to pass a plan to fund the pension system, an effort which he had made a priority in his second and third terms. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did tap into surplus pension funds this year to help offset a $ 450 million revenue shortfall. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also asserted that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has turned a state surplus into a deficit that could grow to $ 700 million by the end of the current fiscal year. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> last year won passage of about $ 180 million in new taxes and cut state spending by more than $ 200 million to end fiscal 1988 with a $ 67 million surplus and to support revenue projections in the current budget. Many legislators, most of them Republicans, have predicted the state will fall short of money again this year but even <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' harshest critics say it is too early to make a credible assessment `` I personally think $ 700 million is a reasonable estimate but you ca n't prove it,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Limited </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taxation </ORGANIZATION> and a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> enemy. `` Nobody can prove it. But candidates snipe at each other.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has stood behind his revenue projections but has promised to cut spending if necessary. He was forced into that position last year and the state has had to borrow on a short-term basis for the first time since 1980, issuing more than $ 1 billion in notes in the past eight months to pay its bills. That will cost taxpayers about $ 20 million in interest payments.

 Two British reporters said Friday that <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> police in a northwestern province punched them and struck them with electric cattle prods before they expelled them from the region. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Luard </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> of The Independent, both based in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, said police detained them Monday when they arrived at the airport in <LOCATION> Kashgar </LOCATION>. The city is in far northwestern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Xinjiang </LOCATION> province. Rumors have been circulating in recent weeks in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> about ethnic unrest in the region, home to a Turkish minority. Police accused the journalists of failing to get permission to visit the region, <PERSON> Luard </PERSON> said after arriving in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Friday. He and <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> denied the charge. Police confiscated their passports and film and struck them on two occasions before putting them on a plane out of <LOCATION> Kashar </LOCATION> on Thursday morning, <PERSON> Luard </PERSON> said. He said the chief of the <LOCATION> Kashgar </LOCATION> police Foreign Affairs Section threw him against a wall and punched him in the chest when the two reporters objected to efforts by police to mount a 24-hour watch inside the room where they were held. He said another police officer dragged <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> into the room, ripping his trousers. On Tuesday, police struck the pair with electric cattle prods when they tried to walk down a street away from the building where they were kept, <PERSON> Luard </PERSON> said. Police also hit several foreign tourists who tried to intervene, he said. The government did not immediately comment on the journalists' charges <PERSON> Luard </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> had applied to <LOCATION> Xinjiang </LOCATION> authorities the required 10 days in advance for permission to visit the region. He said authorities in <LOCATION> Xinjiang </LOCATION>'s capital of <LOCATION> Urumchi </LOCATION>, where they conducted interviews, knew of their plans to go on to <LOCATION> Kashgar </LOCATION> and did not object. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s domestic media is state-run and the government maintains tight control over the movements of foreign journalists. In June, police in a village near <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> threw out two reporters working for the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> news agency <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION> who tried to cover a peasant protest against water pollution in their area. In the past two years, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has expelled three foreign reporters from the country.

 The Vietnamese government has agreed to a joint effort to find the remains of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen missing in action during the Vietnam War, the administration announced Friday. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said the investigation will focus on seven cases in which there is evidence that the victims were alive at the time they came under Vietnamese custody. At the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the seven are part of the 70 `` most compelling cases'' which <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials raised with Vietnamese authorities last year. Other officials said that that although the 70 were presumed to be alive when captured, all have long since been presumed dead because there is no evidence to prove otherwise. A 90-day period, beginning Sept. 1, was set aside for carrying out the investigations, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said, with each one limited to 10 days. About 2,400 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen have been listed as missing in action in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> announced the agreement with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> during a POW-MIA Recognition Day ceremony on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. House Republican Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> urged the families of the missing Americans to ignore the rumors that will be inevitable during the pending search. `` We have to continue to press for an accounting of each and every one, even though the prospects of finding anyone alive diminish with the passing of time,'' <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> told the crowd of several hundred. `` We must continue to seek the truth,'' he said. `` But the two greatest enemies of truth are rumors and false hopes. Nothing could be more cruel to the families of MIAs and POWs than to lend credence to false rumors, to raise hopes without the facts to support them, to muddy the waters and confuse the issue.'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said he was encouraged by recent agreements between Vietnamese Vice Premier <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Co </PERSON> <PERSON> Thach </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s special POW-MIA emissary to <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>, Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> `` Although last month <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> temporarily suspended its offer to conduct joint operations, it recently agreed to resume cooperation, and I am pleased to announce that joint activity will begin on Sept. 25,'' the secretary said <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> has agreed to similar efforts, `` but we still await the results that we know are possible from those who hold the answers,'' he said. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> called on <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> to repatriate remains it claims to hold and criticized the government of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> for failure to return those of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> forces missing in the Korean War. `` The <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> have a golden opportunity this year to display their willingness to rejoin the real world by dealing in good faith through the proper channels on this vital human issue,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, who joined <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> in addressing the crowd. `` Let's hope that when we meet again next year, we can report real progress and real results,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. `` The bottom line is: We'll never forget, and we'll never give up.'' As part of the day of remembrance, wreath-laying ceremonies were being held at the <ORGANIZATION> Arlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cemetery </ORGANIZATION> in honor of POWs and MIAs from the Korean War. An organization dedicated to remembering the families of missing soldiers, No Greater Love, estimates that there are 8,100 MIAs and 389 POWs still unaccounted for in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. An estimated 79,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen were missing in action in World War II.

 <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>'s ex-lover provided some of the new evidence tying a <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> drug dealer to the 1981 Laurel Canyon slayings, for which the late sex-film star <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> once was tried, the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorson </PERSON>, 29, who was <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>'s companion from 1977 to 1982, helped authorities build their case against nightclub owner and convicted cocaine trafficker <PERSON> Adel </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasrallah </PERSON> in the four <ORGANIZATION> Laurel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canyon </ORGANIZATION> beating deaths, the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said, citing unidentified sources. The killings allegedly were in revenge for a cash and drug robbery of <PERSON> Nasrallah </PERSON>, authorities have said, and <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> admitted bringing the assailants to the Laurel Canyon home. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, like <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>, died of acquired immune deficiency syndrome. <PERSON> Nasrallah </PERSON>, 59, who went by the name <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nash </PERSON>, and former bodyguard <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> DeWitt </PERSON> <PERSON> Diles </PERSON>, 40, were charged Sept. 8 with four counts of murder and one of attempted murder. They are being held without bail and face possible death penalties if convicted. Four people were bludgeoned to death during the nighttime attack in the affluent residential neighborhood and a fifth was left for dead. She survived but was unable to identify her attackers. Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON>, who is prosecuting <PERSON> Nash </PERSON> and <PERSON> Diles </PERSON>, said Friday that authorities have new witnesses in the case, but would neither confirm nor deny <PERSON> Thorson </PERSON>'s involvement. `` And right now I'm most interested in protecting my witnesses and avoiding anything that might prejudice the case against Mr. <PERSON> Nash </PERSON> and Mr. <PERSON> Diles </PERSON>, so I ca n't ethically say anything one way or another,'' the prosecutor said. <PERSON> Nash </PERSON> and <PERSON> Diles </PERSON> were scheduled to name attorneys and enter pleas in a court appearance Monday, at which time the prosecution will provide a list of its witnesses and an outline of its case, he said. `` The names of the witnesses will be out before long, but it would be wrong for me to be the first one to give them out,'' <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Thorson </PERSON>, who sued <ORGANIZATION> Liberace </ORGANIZATION> for more than $ 12 million and wrote a kiss-and-tell book about their relationship, remained in jail Friday awaiting sentencing for a drug-related armed robbery. Telephone messages left for his lawyer, Deputy Public Defender <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreyfuss </PERSON>, were not returned. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, a heavy cocaine user, was the top pornographic film star of the'70s, often portraying a detective named <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wadd </PERSON>. During his 1982 trial, witnesses testified that <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> fenced property stolen by the murder victims to <PERSON> Nash </PERSON>, who exchanged them for cocaine. A police detective testified that <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> admitted taking killers to the house the night of July 1, 1981, to placate <PERSON> Nash </PERSON>, who allegedly was angry after being robbed of drugs and $ 10,000 by two of the victims two days before. The robbery was allegedly <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>' idea. And investigators contended the victims allowed the killers inside the house about 10 miles west of downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> because <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> was with them. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> never took the stand and was acquitted. He was later jailed for 111 days for contempt of court for refusing to talk to a grand jury. He agreed to testify before the secret panel in November 1982 after <PERSON> Nash </PERSON> was sentenced to prison for possessing about two pounds of cocaine valued at $ 1 million. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>' grand jury testimony remains sealed, and <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON> said it ca n't be used against <PERSON> Nash </PERSON> or <PERSON> Diles </PERSON>. The sex-film star died of AIDS complications in March, after reportedly granting deathbed interviews to police still investigating the killings. However, his statements apparently yielded little of use to authorities, and <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON> said the evidence used to file the new charges did n't come from <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nash </PERSON>, who ran a chain of strip-joints and punk nightclubs, supplied <PERSON> Thorson </PERSON> with cocaine, the Times said. In an acknowledgment in his recently published book, `` Behind the Candelabra: My Life With <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Thorson </PERSON> named <PERSON> Nash </PERSON> as one of six people who, over the years, offered him `` personal support and understanding.'' <PERSON> Thorson </PERSON> filed two highly publicized lawsuits against <ORGANIZATION> Liberace </ORGANIZATION> contending the flamboyant entertainer reneged on promises to support him for the rest of his life and libeled him by having relatives publish a magazine article calling him a blackmailer. The first suit was settled out of court for $ 95,000, and the other was dismissed shortly after <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> died of AIDS in 1987. Bludgeoned to death in the Laurel Canyon slayings were <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> DeVerell </PERSON>, 42, <PERSON> Joy </PERSON> <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> 46, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, 22, and <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Launius </PERSON>, 37. <PERSON> Launius </PERSON>' wife <PERSON> Susan </PERSON>, then 25, was badly beaten but survived the attack.

<TEXT>
 An exhibit of three generations of <PERSON> Wyeth </PERSON> family art was staged in palaces and ultramodern museums during its world tour, but <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyeth </PERSON> says the works look best hanging in his hometown. The exhibition of 115 works by <PERSON> N.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyeth </PERSON>, his son <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> and his grandson <PERSON> James </PERSON> opens Sunday in <LOCATION> Brandywine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Museum </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Chadds </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ford </LOCATION>. It is the final stop of a 1 -LCB- - year tour that also included stops in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> <PERSON> James </PERSON> until recently has answered to the family nickname of <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON>. But he now wants to be known as <PERSON> James </PERSON>. Speaking at a press preview Friday, he said, `` I've seen the paintings hanging in a czarist building in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> ... in a ultramodern museum in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> ... in an old-style building in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> -RRB-, but it still looks a hell of a lot better here at home.'' <PERSON> Chadds </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, southwest of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, is where <PERSON> N.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyeth </PERSON> settled after traveling through the Old West during the late 1800s and early 1900s. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> were raised here, and many of their works explore the people and surroundings. Other works examine the people and atmosphere of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, where the family has a second home. The most celebrated <PERSON> Wyeth </PERSON>, 71-year-old <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>, was scheduled to attend the press preview, but a touch of the flu and a `` drained'' feeling he gets when he completes a work caused him to stay away Friday, his son said. Through the worldwide tour, people flocked to the exhibit in record-breaking numbers to get a glimpse of art that explores such American traditions and lifestyles as farming and Halloween. But the collection also shows the enduring tradition of an artistic family, and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyeth </PERSON> said that is what appealed most to the exhibit's audiences abroad. `` It was the continuity that really struck them,'' he said. The exhibit opened in <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> in March 1987 and was the first exhibit under the newest cultural exchange program between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` The people were really dying to see the art,'' he said. `` At some openings, people just stand around with their backs to the paintings, but there they were almost pushing me aside to see the paintings.'' Included in the exhibit are three of <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyeth </PERSON> famous `` Helga'' paintings, a series of nudes and other figure studies of the same woman that caused a sensation when its existence was disclosed two years ago. When asked if he had any secret paintings, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyeth </PERSON> laughed. `` Yes, of a lot of pigs,'' he said. He posed for photographs before one of his more famous works, Portrait of a Pig, a 4-by-7-foot painting done in 1970. The pig is one of his favorite subjects and the exhibit displays several paintings of other farm animals as well. The first portion of the exhibit displays <PERSON> N.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyeth </PERSON>'s art. Although there are several paintings of Western scenes and a small self-portrait from 1913, the majority of the 38 works on display are book illustrations. <PERSON> N.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyeth </PERSON>, who died in 1945, illustrated such classics as <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON>'s `` Treasure Island'' and `` Kidnapped,'' and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Twain </PERSON>'s `` The Mysterious Stranger'' in the 1910s and 1920s. The exhibit runs through Nov. 20.

<HEAD>Detroit Newspapers Deal Stalled For Second Time</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> newspaper urged a federal appeals court Friday to lift an order that for a second time stalled its plans to combine business and production departments with a larger rival. Attorneys for the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> asked the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> to allow the agreement to go forward, saying `` entry into a -LRB- joint operating agreement -RRB- is by its nature an emergency remedy.'' The court late Thursday barred the joint operations from beginning after the expiration at 7:15 p.m. Saturday of a lower-court stay. The superseding order carried no expiration date. The appeals court ordered the delay to gain time to study the complex case, the court clerk's office said. The court gave no indication when a ruling might come. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Citizens for an <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, a group of advertisers and readers opposed to the newspapers' joint operating agreement, had asked for a delay in implementing the joint operating agreement. The court declined to grant the group's request, but on its own authority issued a stay The general manager of the Free Press, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, said the stay `` just gives the judges a couple of days to look at the filings'' and has no bearing on the merits of the case. The partial merger under the Newspaper Preservation Act, requested by the newspapers in 1986, was approved last month by then-Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Citizens succeeded in blocking immediate implementation of the agreement through a challenge in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The lower court on Wednesday rejected the challenge, and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Citizens the next day asked the appeals court to consider the case. Free Press attorneys said <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Citizens' had failed to show they were likely to succeed in an appeal or that denial of the stay would cause permanent damage. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Citizens contends the joint operating agreement would set a precedent because it would allow a merger in a case where the newspapers' financial losses were due to management decisions rather than the normal competition in the marketplace. The group said such a precedent could end newspaper competition in 20 cities served by multiple newspapers. The organization argued that the lower court, in granting a stay, had accepted the premise that allowing the partial merger to proceed while under challenge would be contrary to the public interest. The Free Press, owned by <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, had a daily circulation last year of 638,720; the News, owned by <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, had circulation of 678,720, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Audit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circulation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> has said it will close the Free Press if the joint operating agreement does not go through, at a cost of 2,000 jobs. The merger of the newspapers' business, advertising, circulation and production departments would result in the loss at both newspapers of 600 to 800 jobs.

 A transient suspected of accidentally igniting a fire that destroyed 102 homes has been charged in the blaze. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Parris </PERSON>, 39, appeared in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> court Thursday on a charge of felony count of reckless burning. He is also charged with public drunkenness. He was being held Friday on $ 50,000 bail. <PERSON> Parris </PERSON> was at first charged with a misdemeanor count, but the charge was upgraded because of evidence of `` willful and wanton'' disregard of the fire danger, according to District Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Darlington </PERSON>. <PERSON> Parris </PERSON> apparently lived in an abandoned home in a remote area near <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, about 50 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>. The state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> encouraged the district attorney to file the more serious charges to get <PERSON> Parris </PERSON> off the street for his own safety and so he can receive psychological help, said chief ranger <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Paulus </PERSON>. Some residents have expressed anger towards <PERSON> Parris </PERSON>, who police say started the huge blaze Sunday by burning toilet paper outside a makeshift outhouse. The fire destroyed 102 homes and 57 outbuildings, according to state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Terrill </PERSON>. So far, the economic toll has risen beyond $ 15 million, including $ 11 million in property damage and $ 4.2 million in suppression costs. The fire was fully contained on Thursday.

<TEXT>
 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> urged the Marxist government Friday to make peace with guerrillas and offered to let the church mediate in this war-torn country, where 6 million people live on the edge of famine. `` In the face of this lamentable situation, when the opportunity arose, I have never ceased to repeat, ` No to violence and yes to peace,''' the pontiff told President <PERSON> Joaquim </PERSON> <PERSON> Chissano </PERSON> after arriving from neighboring <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION>. `` The efforts of my brother bishops in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> have always received my backing,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> told <PERSON> Chissano </PERSON>, who was baptized a <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> but now is non-practicing. About one-eighth of <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s 11.7 million people are <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>. The bishops have been urging <PERSON> Chissano </PERSON>'s government to start negotiations with anti-Marxist rebels of the <ORGANIZATION> Mozambique </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION>, known by their Portuguese acronym, <ORGANIZATION> Renamo </ORGANIZATION>. The government has refused to negotiate and has criticized the bishops for advocating talk with `` armed bandits.'' `` The weapons we are still obliged to carry are used exclusively to defend our country's freedom and our nation,'' <PERSON> Chissano </PERSON> told the pope at the <ORGANIZATION> Ponte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vermelha </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Red Point -RRB- palace, built by the <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> colonialists before <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> became independent in 1975. `` Your holiness proclaims the path of peace and denounces the paths of hatred, the trade of war, the murder of innocents and the inadmissable methods of terrorism,'' <PERSON> Chissano </PERSON> said. The 11-year-old civil war in this southeast African country has forced about 1 million Mozambicans to flee into neighboring countries. Nearly half <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s 14.5 million people are in need of food aid, according to relief organizations. <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> is the final stop on the pope's 10-day tour of southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. In addition to <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION>, he also has visited <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION> and made a brief unscheduled stop in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> on Wednesday after his plane was diverted in bad weather. The Renamo guerrillas, believed to number between 12,000 and 22,000, roam the countryside almost at will and have caused tremendous econonic damage. No government acknowledges assisting the rebels, who have been accused of widespread civilian atrocities. <ORGANIZATION> Renamo </ORGANIZATION> denies the charges. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, in a report released in April, estimated the rebels killed 100,000 civilians in the past two to three years. <ORGANIZATION> Renamo </ORGANIZATION> this week announced a cease-fire during the pope's visit and wished the pontiff a good stay. Still, <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> announced extensive security measures for the pope and the pilgrims traveling to see him at stops in <LOCATION> Nampula </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Beira </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maputo </LOCATION>, the capital. <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> receives most of its military assistance from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> but increasingly has been making overtures to Western nations. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is the largest donor of food aid in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has been providing military training. <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> also has been working to improve relations with neighboring <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, which has backed <ORGANIZATION> Renamo </ORGANIZATION> in the past. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> says it stopped supporting the guerrillas under terms of a 1984 mutual non-aggression pact, but <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> has continued to accuse <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> of providing assistance. <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> regularly refers to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> as the `` racist regime,'' but on Monday Chissano hosted South African President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> on his first summit meeting in a black-ruled African nation. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> has tried to prod the peace process in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> by sending one of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s top cardinal aides to meet separately with <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chissano </PERSON> in July. Also, some Mozambican bishops reportedly have maintained contacts with <ORGANIZATION> Renamo </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Chissano </PERSON> met the pope in May in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, but the <LOCATION> Vactican </LOCATION> appears to be holding off the establishment of diplomatic relations as an incentive to move the peace process ahead. In <LOCATION> Mbabane </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION>, earlier Friday, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> preached about the virtues of monogamy at a Mass attended by <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION>'s 20-year-old king and his four wives King <PERSON> Mswati </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, the world's youngest monarch, sat expressionless as the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> told a crowd of 10,000 at the capital's national stadium that God intended each husband to have one wife The pope, who arrived at the stadium in his popemobile escorted by spear-carrying warriors, spoke from an altar topped by a turret manned by a soldier with a rifle and binoculars.

 Thousands of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> coastal residents headed back to their deserted homes Friday after Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> barreled away from the <ORGANIZATION> Bayou </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> and toward northeastern <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. `` It feels good to go home,'' said evacuee <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Racca </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Cameron </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parish </LOCATION> resident who spent Thursday night at an evacuation center in a <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Charles </LOCATION> high school gym. He balanced a mattress on his head while he walked out with his wife and three children. <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> <PERSON> Parish </PERSON> civil defense director <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> <PERSON> Picou </PERSON> gave permission for his area's 10,000 residents to return home after deciding that the danger for <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> was almost over. `` We're still monitoring the situation, but we think it's clear enough for everyone to come home,'' <PERSON> Picou </PERSON> said. Other parishes followed <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON>'s lead as the day progressed. But <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Valence </PERSON>, mayor of the barrier island community of Grand Isle, on a remote spit of land exposed to the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, warned the 2,000 residents under his jurisdiction to stay away. Tides churned by <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> threatened to swamp the only road to the mainland by Saturday morning, <LOCATION> Valence </LOCATION> said. And anyone who returned to the island would be trapped if the storm headed back to the Gulf and turned toward <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. Scattered thunderstorms, wind gusts of up to 25 mph and tides three to four feet above normal buffeted <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s coast Friday afternoon, but <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Crouch </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said that would be the extent of the bad weather if the storm's path held. `` I think they are getting right now the worst they can expect,'' said <PERSON> Crouch </PERSON>. Still, <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> exacted a toll on <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and its people. Oil production in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> was shut down for days because offshore workers had to abandon rigs _ first for last week's Hurricane <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION>, then for <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> Also, commercial shrimpers and fishermen had to abandon the Gulf and inland waterways. At <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Isle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Valence </LOCATION> worried about severe coastal erosion that began with <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION> and continued with <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>. As much as 60 feet of beach had washed away by Friday in some areas, he said. In <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> postponed the lucrative Festival Acadiens, a world renowned celebration of Cajun culture and music that draws thousands each year. The festival was moved to the first weekend in October.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> preached about the virtues of monogamy Friday at a Mass attended by the 20-year-old king and his four wives. King <PERSON> Mswati </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, the world's youngest monarch, sat expressionless as the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said God intended each husband to have one wife. The pope arrived at the capital's national stadium in his popemobile escorted by spear-carrying warriors. He spoke from an altar topped by a turret holding a soldier with a rifle and binoculars. A cross on the structure was stamped with a spear, shield and war ax. `` Christians find that a monogamous marital union provides the foundation upon which to build a stable family in accordance with the original plan of God for marriage,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> told a crowd of about 10,000 in the national stadium. `` Hence, any forms of disregard for the equal dignity of men and women must be seen as serious contradiction of the truth that Christ, the king of peace, brought into the world,'' he said. <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> sources said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> was warned by local prelates to tread carefully before addressing the issue of polygamy, but he went ahead anyway. An estimated 70,000 of <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION>'s people _ roughly 10 percent of the population _ are <PERSON> Catholics </PERSON>, but the king is not one of them. <PERSON> Mswati </PERSON> has never issued any statement on his religious beliefs. His father supported freedom of religion and said he was a member of all religions. <PERSON> Mswati </PERSON> is believed to follow in the same tradition, but that has never been confirmed. Later Friday, the pope went on to <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, the last stop on a 10-day visit of southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> that also included <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION>. He urged <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s Marxist government to negotiate with rightist rebels. <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION>, a stable country of 700,000 people wedged between <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, is a dual monarchy under the king, offically known as the Lion, and a queen mother called the Great She Elephant. Polygamy is no longer practiced extensively in <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION>, but it is a tradition in the royal family. <PERSON> Mswati </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Sobhuza </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, had more than 50 wives and at least 68 children during his 60-year reign, which ended with his death in 1982. Also attending the Mass were the queen mother and the former queen regent who briefly ruled the country after <PERSON> Sobhuza </PERSON>'s death. The Mass was unusual from the start. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s open-topped popemobile was driven in the wrong direction after it circled once around the track at the stadium. The warrior escorts and <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> security men expressed dismay when the popemobile started driving out the gate. After driving back into the stadium, the pope slipped off a platform onto the soggy field and climbed back onto the altar.

 Two of the state's leading Democrats won renomination even though they were brushed by scandal, but voters took the advice of a third Democrat who resigned his post after a criminal conviction and said he did not want to be nominated. Among the winners in Thursday's primaries were every Democratic incumbent in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and in the state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> who had sought re-election. Five-term Bronx Congressman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, who was tied to the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> influence peddling scandal but has not been charged with criminal wrongdoing; and state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Ohrenstein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, who has been charged in a criminal indictment with doling out public money for private campaigns, both survived primary challenges. A former incumbent, Rep. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, did lose to state <PERSON> Assemblyman </PERSON> <PERSON> Eliot </PERSON> <PERSON> Engel </PERSON> in a three-way race for the Democratic nomination for <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>'s old congressional seat. <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> had resigned from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in August after his conviction in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> scandal and said he did n't want to be designated as his party's nominee. Ironically, though, he will still be on the November ballot, because the once-popular politician received the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination with no primary opposition. There were no primary races in the only major statewide office up this year _ the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat held by Democrat <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>. His GOP challenger in November will be lawyer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON>. All of Thursday's <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> incumbent winners in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> are virtually assured of victory in the general election in the heavily Democratic city. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Marino </PERSON>, executive director of the state <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said state party leaders are now focusing on suburban and upstate congressional races where <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> winners Thursday face tough contests for seats now held by Republicans. `` What they have to do now is build upon the momentum that they created for themselves and let that take them into Nov. 8,'' he said. The seats include the one held by Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, who opted not to seek re-election in order to made a bid for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nomination. The <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> scandal, in which <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> was convicted and <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> was implicated, involves a now-bankrupt <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> defense contractor whose officials allegedly bribed a number of local and federal officials. <PERSON> Ohrenstein </PERSON>, who's been in the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> since 1960, faces nearly a 400-count indictment in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> charging that he misused public funds to finance the private campaigns of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democratic candidates in 1986. <PERSON> Ohrenstein </PERSON> narrowly repulsed a primary challenge from <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, 29, the son of a wealthy developer who outspent <PERSON> Ohrenstein </PERSON> by a 3-to-1 margin. The drawing power of one famous political name fell short in suburban <LOCATION> Westchester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, as former state official <PERSON> Nita </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowey </PERSON> defeated Hamilton Fish III and a third candidate for the right to oppose Republican Rep. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> DioGuardi </PERSON> in November.

 Cattle being fed for the slaughter market as of Sept. 1 in the seven major beef states totaled 6.67 million head, down 2 percent from a year ago but 4 percent more than inventories of two years ago, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. The placement of new cattle and calves in fattening pens last month was reported at 1.62 million head, down 16 percent from a year ago and down 10 percent from two years ago. Marketings of `` fed'' cattle in August totaled 1.72 million head, the same as a year ago but up 4 percent from two years ago. As of Sept. 1, feedlot inventories were larger than a year earlier in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> but were less in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The seven states produce about three-fourths of the nation's beef. State feedlot cattle inventories are listed here for the seven states.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s new Secretary General <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> on Friday discussed the thorny problem of sharing the alliances's costs and burdens, an issue one top aide said is at `` the top of the list'' for the pact's members. `` I feel confident this alliance has the strength, courage and imagination to overcome our difficulties,'' <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> told reporters after he emerged from his half-hour meeting and hour-long lunch with the president in the White House. `` The president mentioned the American interest ... of his administration, of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, in a more equitable burden-sharing and I told him that the alliance takes this issue very seriously. We are working at it,'' <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> said. A chorus of election-year unhappiness has been voiced in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> due to the disproportionate share the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> bears for forces in allied nations, whose post-World War II economies have boomed and whose companies now compete on the international stage with <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> firms. As a message to the allies, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> overwhelmingly approved a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending bill last month that included restrictions on spending for American troops overseas. Under the plan in the bill, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies would have to pay for the American troops if the cost rises above the 1988 level. <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON>, who said he was optimistic about the future of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, said he believed the alliance will make progress on the cost issue. But he also warned that the question ca n't be reduced to financial considerations alone. `` We should n't treat it in a controversial way, we should look at it as an alliance task,'' he said. `` It's not a confrontation between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the rest of the alliance. It's a common task of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> as an organization and an alliance.'' Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Rozanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridgway </PERSON>, who briefed reporters following <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON>'s visit, said of the burden-sharing question that `` everyone agrees that it's a subject that has to be at the top of the list.'' She noted that <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON>, during his meetings earlier this week with Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and Secretary of Defense <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> has `` given it his personal priority.'' `` On both sides of this conversation -LRB- there is -RRB- a conviction that this discussion has to be an intra-alliance discussion, that it can not become an us-vs. - them, a U.S.-vs. - all-others kind of discussion The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did not discuss the topic in great detail, but she added that <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> is `` pressing ahead'' with a study of the issue. The official said that the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> visitors did report that they were `` struck'' by the attention the issue is receiving in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` It is the kind of question -LRB- that -RRB- if non-examined, can become divisive and no one wants that to happen,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Ridgway </PERSON> said.

 The owners of a hotel extensively damaged when an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> jet crashed into it last October, killing 10 people, have reached a $ 4 million settlement with their insurance company, it was announced Friday. <ORGANIZATION> Shelby </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Shelby </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, agreed to the payment of the <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inn </ORGANIZATION>'s claim.

He saw a pie-shaped field, aimed the plane at it and ejected while about 300 feet above the ground. The jet then veered to the right and hit a bank building before bouncing into the street and slamming into the <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inn </ORGANIZATION>, causing a deadly fireball.

 Former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bible </PERSON> was remembered Friday as a giant in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> whose quiet work helped preserve the nation's natural resources. `` There is not an area in this country that has not benefited from <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bible </PERSON>,'' former Gov. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Callaghan </PERSON> said in a eulogy to 350 people that included <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>'s top government and business leaders. `` There is hardly a state in the union that does not owe a debt of gratitude to this quiet Senator.

Bible, a Democrat, sponsored legislation in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> that set up the nation's first protection acts for parks, water, air, wildlife and historical sites, including the Grand Canyon.

<TEXT>
 A political director of the Nicaraguan Contras said Friday he hoped the rebels will reach agreement within the next three weeks on a long-term peace accord with the leftist <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> government. But even if the talks do not succeed, said directorate member <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON>, the militarily weakened rebels will have captured the moral high ground by demonstrating their willingness to seek peace. `` There is the perception that the negotiation process is stalled and that the resistance has not done everything possible'' to keep it on track, <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> told reporters after meeting with congressional leaders. The Contras have been blamed for the breakup of peace talks June 9. The new rebel initiative means both <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the new administration taking office in January `` will definitely have found that we went the extra mile,'' he said. `` Taking the decision to go back -LRB- into talks with the Sandinista government -RRB- without military aid is a very extraordinary gesture of good faith on the part of the resistance,'' <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> said. The Contras, formally known as the Nicaraguan Resistance, announced on Thursday that they would send a delegation to preliminary talks in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on Monday aimed at a resumption of the peace talks. <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> said they will offer to begin formal, high-level peace talks Sept. 26-28 in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> or the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. The rebels say they will place no preconditions on the talks, but will ask that the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> release 39 people jailed July 10 after an anti-government demonstration in <LOCATION> Nandaime </LOCATION>, a town near <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. Col. <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>, the rebels' military commander and a newly elected directorate member, said the prisoner release would `` create a good climate for the negotiations.'' In separate meetings with <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, and Minority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., members of the rebel directorate said they hoped to reach an agreement that would let their troops, most of which have been withdrawn from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> into camps along the Honduran border, relocate in previously designated cease-fire zones inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> They also said they wanted to establish goals for democratic reforms to be implemented in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and promised that, `` with these reforms undertaken,'' they would lay down their arms. In a letter to congressional leaders, the rebels asked that a $ 27 million humanitarian aid package now pending as part of a disputed Pentagon money bill be modified to permit training for Contra soldiers in `` human rights, hygiene, leadership skills and political education;'' civic action to aid civilians affected by the war, including medical supplies and `` basic work tools;'' communications gear to maintain contact with troops in the field; and unspecified `` equipment needed to preserve ... physical safety'' for troops en route to cease-fire zones. Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON>, D-Mich., a leading Contra opponent, said it was unlikely the aid package would be modified `` It's a delicate compromise'' reached after three weeks of negotiations among <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats, he said, adding, `` I'm very skeptical of people's motives.

 Federal regulators opened an investigation into reports that defective seats on more than 3 million Chrysler and <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> vehicles can cause drivers to lose control, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. The agency also opened 10 other preliminary evaluations, the lowest level of investigation, into alleged automotive defects. Seat backs on 1.5 million <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> cars and 1.7 million Chrysler Caravan and Voyager vehicles allegedly are prone to collapse suddenly, jarring the driver and causing him or her to steer out of control, according to unconfirmed reports received by <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION>. The agency ordered preliminary evaluations of all <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> passenger vehicles made from 1982 through 1984 and all 1984-1987 Chrysler Caravan and Voyager models. <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> said it has received 17 complaints of seat-back failure in the <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> vehicles, allegedly resulting in four accidents in which five people were injured. Nine complaints received by the agency involved the Caravan and Voyager. There was allegedly one accident in which three people were injured, <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> said. `` We are aware of the <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> investigation and have received the inquiry,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Cervone </PERSON>. `` We are investigating the claim ourselves and will cooperate fully with <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION>'s investigation.'' <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION> said it would have no immediate comment. Four new investigations involved other major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automakers. The agency was studying allegations of door-hinge pin failure on <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s 1987-88 Beretta and <LOCATION> Corsica </LOCATION> models, and a <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> service bulletin reporting erratic cruise-control response on the company's 1988 G vans with 6.2-liter diesel engines. <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> also opened probes of alleged failure of a seat-belt clip in <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s 1984 Mustang and floormat interference with the accelerator in the company's 1987-1988 Thunderbird and Cougar cars.

 A honeymoon in paradise turned into a nightmare for newlyweds who wound up sharing their closet with another couple as a shelter against the fury of Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>. `` Next time we're going to the -LRB- <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> -RRB- <PERSON> Dells </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, 23, who returned from <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> on Thursday with his wife, <PERSON> Vicky </PERSON>, 23. `` It was frightening, and very sad,'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> said. `` It made us sick to our stomachs. Those people did n't have much to live in before. And the people who run the shops ... well, the tourists are their life.'' The Charleses, both registered nurses at <ORGANIZATION> Bellin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, flew out of <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> on one of the first commercial flights leaving the vacation island. The Bellevue couple had flown to <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> on Sept. 7, four days after their wedding. They stayed at a hotel about 10 miles up the coast from <LOCATION> Montego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> said he was reassured by hotel officials Sunday night that the weather would n't be a problem. `` When we woke up Monday morning, there was a note under our door that a hurricane was coming,'' he said. `` We were on the fourth floor and they moved us to the third floor. But we were never told anything the whole time.'' They spent Monday walking around the village. That day they saw a grass hut in front of the hotel blow away and decided to take cover. `` Another honeymoon couple hid in our closet and we got under the bed,'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> said. `` But then the glass started to crash and we got in the closet with them.'' They barricaded themselves with mattresses and stayed in the closet for almost two hours. `` Everything was shaking and we could hear the roof coming off,'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> said. `` Windows were crashing in and we had some water come under the closet door. It was frightening.'' The Charleses later offered their medical help to hotel officials. That night, they shared their room with eight people. The newlyweds had three choices of places to go for their honeymoon, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> said: `` <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Cayman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION>.'' All three were hit by the hurricane.

The bus, whose passengers attended a rally of the <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, was bedecked with pictures of the `` martyrs of the resistance'' and red flags dangled from the windows, the spokesman said. The <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> militiamen `` could not bear the sight of the red flags hanging out of the bus,'' said the spokesman who can not be identified in line with standing regulations. He said the Syrians, who are deployed in the area, are trying to `` calm things down.'' The rally celebrated the front's sixth anniversary. The group has launched many attacks against Israeli troops and their allied south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> army militia in <LOCATION> south </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Farmers Offer To Take Additional 3.4 Million Acres From Production</HEAD>

 Farmers have offered to take an additional 3.4 million acres of highly erodible cropland from production under the 10-year Conservation Reserve Program, or <ORGANIZATION> CRP </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hertz </PERSON>, administrator of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stabilization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said the offers, or bids, were made in the seventh signup for the program held July 18 through Aug. 31. Under the program, farmers agree to take land from production for 10 years. In return, based on bids they submit, farmers get annual rental payments from the government and one-time assistance pay for half the cost of planting grass, trees and shrubs to guard against erosion. The annual rental payments have been averaging around $ 50 per acre. Acceptance of the bids will be announced around Dec. 15, <ORGANIZATION> Hertz </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in the 1985 farm law set a goal of 40 million to 45 million acres for the program by 1990. `` New CRP contracts may not be entered into which provide for an annual rental rate in excess of the prevailing local rental rate for comparable land,'' he said. `` Making this determination on each bid will require extra time.'' Including more than 25.5 million acres signed up earlier, the latest offers would boost the program to almost 29 million acres if all of the new bids are accepted. <ORGANIZATION> Hertz </ORGANIZATION> said he was encouraged by the continued interest in the <ORGANIZATION> CRP </ORGANIZATION>, particularly in view of the 1988 drought. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, senior associate of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a private, non-profit research organization based in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, said the latest offerings were `` really a pretty amazing signup when it started at the worst of the drought.'' <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said the signup could have turned out to be light, since crop prices were going up rapidly because of the drought and it would have been tempting for many farmers to think about growing crops instead. `` But a lot of them may have thought these high -LRB- commodity -RRB- prices are n't here to stay,'' <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said. `` Also, the department raised the bid levels the Corn Belt, and that helped.''

 The prosecution's attempt to pin the torture-murder of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug agent on three men is like an effort to catch a greased pig that keeps slipping away, a defense attorney said at the murder trial Friday. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarlow </PERSON> accused Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gurule </PERSON> of altering the facts in the case as the prosecution tried to weave a web of circumstantial evidence around the defendants. And he said key prosecution witnesses were criminals who are lying in an attempt to get lenient treatment. `` No matter how Mr. <PERSON> Gurule </PERSON> tries to twist and distort the evidence, I'm convinced you will see the truth,'' <PERSON> Tarlow </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Tarlow </PERSON> represents <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON>, 38, who is charged as an accessory to the murder of <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON>. He made the greased pig comparison in the first day of closing defense arguments in the eight-week federal court trial. <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> was abducted outside the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Consulate in <LOCATION> Guadalajara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, on Feb. 7, 1985. His badly beaten body and that of associate, <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Zavala </PERSON> <PERSON> Avelar </PERSON> were found a few weeks later, buried on a remote Mexican ranch. The defense lawyer told jurors a folksy tale, saying he was recently complaining about the prosecution's case to a country lawyer friend. The friend, <PERSON> Tarlow </PERSON> said, told him prosecution efforts reminded him of the carnival game where people try to catch a greased pig. `` That pig started to slip and slide and slither away,'' <PERSON> Tarlow </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Tarlow </PERSON> then attacked the testimony of prosecution witnesses, calling them `` liars, cheats and perjurers,'' contending they were influenced by prosecutors promising lenient treatment in other cases. He admitted that the jury had a difficult task in trying to determine the guilt or innocence of <PERSON> Felix </PERSON>, an admitted drug trafficker. `` Can a Mexican citizen drug dealer get a fair trial in a horrible case like this one, what with the war on drugs on everybody's mind and with sympathy for agent <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON>?'' <PERSON> Tarlow </PERSON> asked jurors. Thursday, <PERSON> Gurule </PERSON> called <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> a heroic law officer who paid `` the ultimate price'' when he was slain while working undercover in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Charged with murder in the case are <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON>, 28, and <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Verdugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Urquidez </PERSON>, 36. <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> is accused of helping Mexican drug kingpin <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON> flee to <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> after the slayings.

 Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said Friday that Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has wrongly criticized the Democrats but had `` a bad case of laryngitis'' about budget deficits, arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and dealings with Panamanian leader <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Stumping for votes on the steps of the <ORGANIZATION> Pitt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Courthouse </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee rejected <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s charge Thursday that with <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as governor, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> had become a `` fiscal fiasco'' of high taxes and lost jobs. `` Well, it was Pearl Harbor Day all over again. As usual, <PERSON> George </PERSON> got all of his facts wrong,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said, reminding his snickering audience of 1,000 people about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s remark last week that Sept. 7 rather than Dec. 7 was the anniversary of the Japanese attack on <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. Standing in the shadow of a statue of a Confederate soldier, the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator praised the Democratic presidential candidate's gubernatorial record `` Under <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> unemployment is the lowest rate of any major industrial state in this union,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. `` Wages are growing twice as fast as the national average, personal income growing faster than any other state, and he submitted 10 balanced budgets in a row.'' `` When <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> speaks out against <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' he said, `` we should all remember that when it came to speaking out against arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, when it came to speaking out against cozy deals with Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, when it came to speaking out against economic policies that have almost tripled the national debt, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did n't speak, he just voted present. `` I'll tell you, when it comes to strong leadership, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has got himself a bad case of laryngitis,'' said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, who will complete a four-day Southern campaign tour in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. `` I'm looking for old friends who wandered away in recent years,'' he told the <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION> crowd, his biggest of the week. `` I'm talking to the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Democrats. I'm urging them to come home, and they're responding.'' Earlier in the day at <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told a breakfast crowd of party loyalists that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' positions on trade, the economy, education and defense were ones that Southerners could support. He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s attacks grew out of `` panic'' over the Democratic ticket's early lead in public opinion polls. `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> are prepared to pay the price to defend freedom. And you have my word on it,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. Introduced by Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, D-Tenn., and former <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> Gov <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Winter </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said the Republicans were trying to hide such policy failures of the past eight years as a near-tripling of the national debt. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> talking about balanced budgets,'' he said in <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>. `` It's like <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> talking about his resume.

 Searchers on Friday found the bodies of four people amid the wreckage of a single-engine plane that crashed and burned a week ago en route to a fly-in at this northern <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> town, authorities said.

 Criminal investigators are looking for a connection among three decapitated bodies of young men found since May in widely separated areas of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. The only current ties in the three deaths are that none of the bodies showed signs of a struggle and that they shared similar physical characteristics, officials said. The first was found in May near <LOCATION> Cartersville </LOCATION> in northwestern <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, the second Sept. 6 near <LOCATION> Warwick </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and the third Wednesday near <LOCATION> Bogart </LOCATION> in the northeastern part of the state. All three were missing hands and head, with one also missing his feet. None of the three has been identified, and officials have released no cause of death in any of the cases. `` There's no question, to find bodies like this in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> is very, very unusual,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bankhead </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're trying to see how they might be linked, but there's no way we can be sure if they are right now,'' he said. The bureau is checking with other states to see if there are similar cases. Local sheriffs said each man appeared be of average height, between 5-feet-6 and 6-feet, and of average build. Officials believe each man was killed elsewhere and then left where the bodies were found. Investigators hope they can find leads from the clothing found on the Bogart and <LOCATION> Bartow </LOCATION> bodies. The <ORGANIZATION> Warwick </ORGANIZATION> body was clad only in underwear.

<HEAD>New Technology Can Produce Hydrogen From Coal, Researcher Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new technology means that coal, often considered a major culprit in the `` greenhouse effect'' warming of the earth, could be a source of benign energy, a government researcher told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee Friday. <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, a chemical engineer and coal expert at the <ORGANIZATION> Brookhaven </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, proposed to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> a new technical option for long-term consideration, `` a hydrogen economy based on coal'' made possible by <ORGANIZATION> Brookhaven </ORGANIZATION> research. Energy experts have eyed hydrogen for decades as a possible fuel when the world can no longer burn petroleum. Though hydrogen is an extremely dangerous gas to handle, burning it simply produces water as a combustion product. Liquid hydrogen has been used as a rocket fuel. Most methods of making hydrogen also produce carbon dioxide, the principal gas among several whose increasing concentration in the atmosphere, according to some climatologists, is causing the earth to warm by a half-degree Fahrenheit per decade. These scientists say the warming will raise sea levels and shift rainfall patterns to make drought in the central <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> more likely, according to many climatologists. Some analysts have speculated that hydrogen would have to be produced from the decomposition of water using nuclear or some form of solar energy, or electricity from water flowing over dams. These energy sources leave no carbon dioxide behind. `` We have developed a very efficient process'' to produce a hydrogen-rich gas from coal, said <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>. `` We are suggesting that coal refineries be built based on this process.'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> offered few details of the process he called `` hydro-carb,'' which he said was originally developed to produce carbon black, a pure form of carbon important in producing tires and in segments of the chemical industry. Carbon black now is made from petroleum or natural gas. The carbon produced by the new process, he suggested, could simply be stored and `` used as a clean fuel'' if carbon dioxide emissions from combustion could be tolerated. `` All impurities would already be removed,'' he said. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said such a strategy would have severe costs, `` but probably not any more severe than going all the way to the nuclear option.'' Direct removal of carbon dioxide from smokestacks is possible, he said, `` But what are we going to do with gigatons -LRB- billions of tons -RRB- of carbon dioxide?'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> and a colleague, <PERSON> Hsing </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheng </PERSON>, calculated in 1986 that direct removal of carbon dioxide from utility smokestacks would be so costly that the price of electricity could double, the project would consume 11 percent to 16 percent of the electrical capacity of the nation and could require a pipeline network to dispose of liquid carbon dioxide on the ocean floor that would need an investment of $ 284 billion in 1980 dollars or about $ 330 billion today. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Grasser </PERSON>, said he had not heard of the <ORGANIZATION> Brookhaven </ORGANIZATION> development, `` but it sounds like an interesting process.'' Several techniques are already used to produce combustible gas from coal, generally yielding a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide with a heating value from 10 percent to 30 percent of natural gas. Burning these gases yields carbon dioxide from the carbon monoxide. Coal accounts for about 80 percent of the carbon dioxide emissions from electricity generation in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The committee is considering a bill that would require new fossil power plants to double fuel efficiency after 2010, cars to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 75 percent after that date, all new furnaces and water heaters in five years to equal the performance of today's best and all new air conditioners to double their efficiency in five years The committee released an analysis by the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assessment </ORGANIZATION> concluding that actions called for by the bill until 2010 would be possible with today's technlogies, but after that new technology would be needed unless society is prepared to accept nuclear power.

<HEAD>Streams Show Decline in Lead Concentrations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is getting the lead out. That's the word from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Survey </ORGANIZATION>, which reports that the amount of lead in the nation's rivers and streams declined over a decade. The general reduction in lead levels is likely a result of reduced use of leaded gasoline, the recently published study said. Survey scientists checked the water at some 300 locations across the country, and found declines in lead at two-thirds of the stations _ including significant drops at 30 percent of them, between 1974 and 1985. `` Although we have not completed intensive trend analyses on data collected since 1985, preliminary results indicate that the overall decline in lead concentrations has continued,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> in a statement. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, hydrologists at the Survey's <LOCATION> Reston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, compiled the report which was published in the most recent edition of Water Resources Bulletin `` This decline is certainly good news as far as the water environment is concerned,'' <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> observed. Lead is considered a hazard because, if ingested, it can cause brain damage and eventually, even death. The Survey said increases in lead in stream water were found in a few locations, principally along the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> and Lower <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> regions. None was in water that was used for drinking, however. The increases were thought to be largely due to declines in the volume of water flowing in those areas in the last few years of the study. Declining water volumes tend to concentrate pollutants. Assessing the effectiveness of pollution abatement efforts is often hard to do because of the lack of widespread, long-term measurements. The Survey's water-quality measurements, which have been conducted since the early 1970s, are at least one way to do this, said <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>. Gasoline is believed to be the primary source of lead in streams and rivers, and the drop in river concentrations of the metal has occurred in parallel with the reduction in use of leaded gasoline, he pointed out. The largest part of the reduction in lead in rivers and streams occurred in 1979-80, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> noted, and that was the same period that saw the steepest decline in the use of leaded gasoline. Industrial discharges of lead into streams and rivers were sharply cut prior to 1977, he noted.

 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said Friday that Soviet forces will abandon a strategic naval base in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> pulls its armed forces from bases in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. In a key foreign policy speech, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> leader announced that the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> has frozen its nuclear weapon stocks in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. He also responded to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allegations that a Siberian radar violates a superpower arms treaty by suggesting the station be used to study space. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> made the 1 -LCB- - hour speech during a meeting with <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and local government workers in the city of <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION>, 2,000 miles east of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and the site of the controversial radar The official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency carried a summary. A seven-point plan `` aimed at strengthening security in the <LOCATION> Asia-Pacific </LOCATION> region,'' highlighted the speech, the first major address by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> since he returned Monday from a six-week vacation. It was the first time <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> focused on relations with <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> since a July 28, 1986 speech at the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Vladivostok </LOCATION>. In that speech, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> called for a summit with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and peace in the region. Friday's speech reiterated the call for a summit with <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and urged <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> not to increase its military strength. `` Aware of the Asian and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> countries' concern, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will not increase the amount of any nuclear weapons in the region _ it has already been practicing this for some time _ and is calling on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other nuclear powers not to deploy them additionally in the region,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> summary. `` If the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> agrees to the elimination of military bases in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will be ready ... to give up the fleet's material and technical supply station in <LOCATION> Cam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ranh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> describes <PERSON> Cam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ranh </PERSON> <PERSON> Bay </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> as the Soviets' largest naval deployment base abroad, threatening <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military presence in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> said about 7,000 Soviet personnel are stationed there. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> maintains six bases in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. The two major bases _ <LOCATION> Subic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> _ are the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military installations outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but American-Filipino talks on an agreement to review the final two years of the leases, which expire in 1991, have stalled. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> commented on <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s proposal regarding the bases `` I have n't had an opportunity to go into it in detail in what it is he's proposing, but I look forward to doing that because certainly we want to do anything we can to help bring about a better relationship between our two countries,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told reporters. On Thursday, Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said talks in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> on compensation for the bases and other issues `` basically are n't going well.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> proposed `` that a center for international cooperation in the utilization of space for peaceful purposes be set up on the basis of the <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> radar station,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Although his wording was vague, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> appeared to be offering to dismantle or convert the 30-story radar. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government says the installation violates the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty and is a major obstacle to talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> toward halving long-range missile arsenals. `` Speculation about the <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> radar station continues,'' the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> leader said in remarks carried by Soviet television. `` It's turning out to have a slowing effect on the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> negotiations.'' The move would also put more pressure on the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to act on Soviet complaints the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is violating the ABM treaty, particularly by its Star Wars program for a space-based missile defense. `` Our concern over the construction of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> radar stations in <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> remains. Experts say that they are a downright violation of the ABM treaty. We expect that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> will take appropriate measures in response to our initiative,'' he said. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> offered last month to dismantle the radar equipment if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> agreed to commit itself to the ABM treaty for nine or 10 years. Asked about <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s proposal on the <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> radar, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> reiterated the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position that the facility must be dismantled because it violates ABM treaty. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has maintained the radar violates the treaty because it is not at the edge of the country, pointed outward, as the pact stipulates such a radar must be. The Soviets maintain the radar is designed for the tracking of satellites and spacecraft and not for the detection of any incoming missiles. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> implied that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> agreed to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demands that the <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> base be scrapped. `` This is our reply to the West's concerns over the <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> station,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as saying. On <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said Soviets `` stand for the full normalization of relations'' and noted `` goodwill and trust'' have been increasing with the Chinese. The Kremlin's ties with <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> have been strained since the two Communist giants split over ideological and strategic differences in the early 1960s. Friday's speech came at the end of a five-day visit to the <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> region during which <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> heard numerous complaints from residents about poor living conditions. The 57-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief referred to those complaints in Friday's address and said social problems are a priority, especially food shortages.

 Four American citizens who chained themselves to a gate of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> three days ago to protest <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s policies in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> are within their rights, an embassy spokesman said Friday. `` This is an example of the right to protest in a country where the right of free expression is respected,'' embassy spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> said. It was the embassy's first official response. The protesters who began the demonstration Wednesday by throwing a liquid resembling blood on the embassy steps and then chained themselves to the main entrance were identified as <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashara-Davis </PERSON>, 34, of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, Md.; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Schuchardt </PERSON>, 49, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Story </PERSON>, 26, and <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Litery </PERSON>, 57, both of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> D.C </ORGANIZATION>. The four, along with 16 other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens jailed in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, belong to a group called Project Independence, <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> said the protesters in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> have not caused any major problems or blocked people from entering and leaving the embassy. The protesters said they have asked to talk to <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, but <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> said that `` up to now, they have not made that request through the normal channels.'' In <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, police Maj. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Urbina </PERSON> said Thursday that 16 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens were jailed after demonstrating at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION> and at the <LOCATION> Palmerola </LOCATION> air base 40 miles northwest of the capital. <PERSON> Urbina </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, said the detainees probably would be expelled. A declaration issued by the Project Independence group said, `` At this time of remembering Central American independence from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> -LRB- in 1821 -RRB- we've come to join with Central Americans in declaring its independence from <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. domination.''

 A 350-pound sow decided she was n't ready for hog heaven and tried to make a break for it on the way to the slaughterhouse. Or maybe she just wanted new duds for the occasion. The daring hog leaped from a truck onto the six-lane <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 70 in front of a shopping mall Thursday. `` That's the first time I've ever come along to find a pig in the road,'' said trucker <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Belk </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Salisbury </LOCATION>. A witness told police the hog lifted the truck's tailgate with its snout. Once out of the truck, the stunned sow stood in the road for at least 15 minutes, refusing to budge as amazed motorists stopped, stared and honked. `` The pig was n't afraid at all,'' said <PERSON> Charlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>. `` A trucker blew his horn at her and she would n't budge.'' About eight police officers and motorists helped the truck's driver reload the hog, which was n't hurt except for a few scrapes `` Did they say she was going to slaughter?'' asked police officer R.B. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. `` I would've jumped out, too.''

<HEAD>Report: Late Rains Of Little Immediate Benefit But Will Aid 1989
Crops</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Rains that began in mid-August and continued into early September `` provided much needed relief to parched areas of the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and Southeast,'' President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s interagency drought committee said Friday. `` These rains provided little benefit to this year's grain crop due to their occurrence late in the growing season, but they will improve forage supplies and soil moisture conditions for 1989 crops,'' the committee report said. The report was the fourth since the committee was formed in mid-June. A final summation will be prepared in December, the report said. `` In recent weeks, the focus of the 1988 drought has shifted from agriculture to the severe wildfires in the far West,'' the report said. `` Nationwide, over 68,000 wildfires have destroyed over 4.1 million acres,'' it added. l `` As a result of excessive heat and dryness in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, no relief is expected in the near term for the nation's The economic impact of forest damage this year will extend into future years.'' In the case of agriculture, the drought caused crop damage and other losses that are estimated to total about $ 14 billion to $ 16 billion this year in terms of 1982 farm prices, the report said. However, the net cash income of farmers is expected to be about equal to last year's level because of sales from inventory stocks and higher commodity prices. The committee, headed by <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON>, included <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> and representatives of the vice president's office, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Tennesee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Textile Lawmakers Keep Bill Out of Conference Committee</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Textile-state lawmakers won a key tactical victory Friday in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, persuading a committee chairman to change course and push for approval of Senate-passed import legislation without any changes. `` In my opinion this will insure passage of the textile bill by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> this year,'' Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION>, said after receiving word of the decision. `` The biggest danger we face now is a presidential veto.'' The bill, designed to protect American manufacturers from foreign competition, would freeze current textile and apparel imports at 1987 levels and hold growth to one percent annually starting next year. Advancing amid a flurry of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration veto threats, the measure would also cap nonrubber footwear imports at 1987 levels with no provision for increases. <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, D-Ill., met for 45 minutes with 20 textile-state lawmakers and then consulted with senior committee members before deciding on an about-face that will avoid sending the bill to a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> conference committee At <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>'s urging, the committee had approved Wednesday a plan to send the bill to a conference committee with the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to resolve differences. Textile lawmakers said the measure could become snagged in the conference committee. House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, told reporters Thursday that it was `` not certain'' that the measure would go to a conference committee. He indicated that there was still time to change course. The bill's supporters say it is needed to save American jobs that will inevitably dwindle as the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market becomes flooded with textile and apparel imports. Critics say the measure represents protectionism that would narrow consumer choices and actually cost more jobs than it would save when Asian textile-exporting nations retaliate. Congressional supporters of the textile industry expect <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to veto the legislation. He vetoed an earlier version in 1985. Thus far, industry supporters have been unable to muster the two-thirds support in either house needed to override a veto and pass the measure into law over the president's objections. At all costs, however, they hope to deny <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> the opportunity to exercise a so-called pocket veto. The president may prevent a bill from becoming law when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is out of session merely by refusing to sign it. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had set a target date for adjournment of Oct. 5, although that easily could be extended an extra week. Textile industry supporters say forcing <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to use his veto pen and not merely kill the bill with a pocket veto would exact a much higher political price from the Republican ticket in textile-producing states. Differences between the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill and the year-old <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> version are few. The House bill would freeze imports at 1986 levels. It would set up a one-year pilot program under which the government would auction off import licenses. It would guarantee better quotas to countries that increased their purchases of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm goods. And it would set up a special quota for imported silk neckties. Other than that, the two measures are the same.

 A sinkhole that opened up beneath a stretch of railroad track caused 27 cars of a freight train to derail, <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> officials said Friday. `` The hole is the cause of the accident, there is no doubt about that. It's as if a bridge fell or a tunnel collapsed. It's obvious the whole track dropped fix to six feet.

Another <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> <PERSON> Leckie </PERSON>, said a depression, about 100 feet long, 10 feet wide and 5 feet deep, formed under the tracks as the train rolled along early Thursday. `` There was apparently some water intrusion under the roadbed which caused the track structure to collapse. The key question is what caused this intrusion,'' <PERSON> Leckie </PERSON> said. He said the appearance of the hole was `` sudden, unobservable and undetectable,'' adding that four locomotives and eight cars passed over it before the derailment and other trains had used the tracks an hour earlier. Tanker cars damaged in the derailment spewed noxious fumes into the air. Two <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> troopers were hospitalized for respiratory problems after inhaling potassium hydroxide, and several other officers and railroad workers were treated for respiratory problems. The derailment forced the closing of five major intersections and 45 nearby businesses. Four intersections and the businesses reopened Friday.

 Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and Interior Minister <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> agreed at a six-hour meeting Friday that round-table debates on the future of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> would begin in mid-October. Those talks will include the future of the outlawed Solidarity labor federation and of trade union pluralism. `` Our positions got closer. I am satisfied,'' a tired-looking <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said after the meeting at a government guest house outside <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> broke up at about 9 p.m. -LRB- 3 p.m. EDT -RRB-. `` Some bitter things were traded,'' said mediator <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Stelmachowski </PERSON>. It was the second meeting between <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and communist authorities in two days, and was called to set terms for a broad round-table meeting of social groups on major Polish problems. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> last month persuaded striking workers to end a wave of walkouts after obtaining from the government an agreement to meet. The labor unrest posed the most serious threat to Solidarity since it was crushed with the imposition of martial law in 1981. Twenty-five people took part in Friday's meeting, among them other Solidarity leaders and representatives of the officially sanctioned trade union alliance OPZZ who were invited to the preparatory talks for the first time. `` During the talks, matters related to the organization of the round table were discussed,'' said a joint communique issued after the meeting and carried by the state news service PAP. `` The positions of the sides were brought closer,'' it said, adding that the talks touched on the state and public life, the national economy and `` the shape of the Polish trade union movement.'' `` It was decided that the round-table debates would start in mid-October,'' the statement said. `` There is no freedom without Solidarity,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> told reporters waiting for him at a church complex after the session. <PERSON> Stelmachowski </PERSON>, a law professor who has been the go-between in arranging the meetings, reported, `` No definite decisions were taken, but there was some progress.'' He said it would be too early to say that authorities have agreed to restore legal status to Solidarity. `` It seems to me that some chance for legalization is coming into view,'' he said. `` But needless to say all that still requires some time and patience. ... When you are baking something in the kitchen, you can not say much yet.'' Authorities and official trade unions were represented by 13 people led by <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>, Alternate Politburo member <PERSON> Stanislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciosek </PERSON> and <PERSON> Romuald </PERSON> <PERSON> Sosnowski </PERSON>, deputy chairman of the official trade union alliance OPZZ, <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said. For the opposition, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stelmachowski </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Wroclaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Wladyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Frasyniuk </PERSON> and seven other members or advisers of Solidarity took part. In addition, two priests were present representing the church. <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Czyrek </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling Politburo, was quoted by the TV news `` Panorama of the Day'' as saying in an interview, `` The round-table alone is a success, as is the fact that the psychological and political barrier, very difficult for either side, has been surmounted.'' Among the Solidarity members were chairmen of four interfactory strike committees that directed last month's strikes, which demanded that Solidarity's legal status be restored. The <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc's first independent union, with a membership of 10 million people, was outlawed in October 1982 after being suspended in the Dec. 13, 1981, martial law crackdown. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and most of the Solidarity representatives were planning to leave <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Saturday to attend an annual workers' pilgrimage this weekend at the <PERSON> Jasna </PERSON> <PERSON> Gora </PERSON> monastery in <LOCATION> Czestochowa </LOCATION>. During a meeting lasting more than four hours Thursday, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> agreed to continue efforts to convene the talks `` as soon as possible.'' That meeting was only <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s second encounter with authorities in six years. At a meeting with <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> on Aug. 31, <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> agreed that the talks would include Solidarity's future. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> then successfully ended the strikes so talks could start. `` The idea of the ` round-table' creates hope for directing all constructive forces of the Polish nation toward the improvement of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s economy,'' an OPZZ statement issued Thursday evening on the state <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news service said.

 A jury decided Friday that <PERSON> Valerie </PERSON> <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> was right and <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telepictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> was wrong in the dispute that ended her role in the `` Valerie'' television series, awarding her nearly $ 2 million in damages and a share of the profits. The jurors gave <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Cacciotti </PERSON>, who worked as a supervising producer for the show, $ 1.85 million in general damages. The jury found that <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> also is entitled to 12.5 percent of the adjusted gross profits of the series for the 1987-88 season _ even though she was no longer on the show for most of the season. The contract wold have run through 1991. Her lawyer estimated that her share of last season's profits could eventually amount to as much as $ 15 million if the show is syndicated. Jurors found that <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> had acted with `` oppression and malice'' in firing her. But the jury declined to grant her and her husband any punitive damages. `` The television business is just like any other business,'' said jury foreman <PERSON> Archie </PERSON> <PERSON> McDaniels </PERSON>, a postal worker. `` You have good and bad. This verdict does n't condemn the TV industry. You just have to treat people fairly.'' Some of the jurors lined up in the hallway after delivering their verdict to get Miss <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>'s autograph. The actress, engulfed by well-wishers and reporters as she left the courtroom, said she felt `` vindicated.'' She said she hoped the decision will be `` a landmark in terms of how actors are dealt with.'' `` People have to be accountable for what they do,'' she said. `` That's the real victory in this case.'' <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Engel </PERSON> called the verdict `` a mixed bag'' and said that from <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON>'s standpoint, `` it could have been worse.'' He said he was pleased that no punitive damages were awarded, and added that in a case that pitted an an individual against a big corporation, `` we did n't do so bad.'' He said an appeal was unlikely because `` the verdict is so small,'' but <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Brogliatti </PERSON> said: `` We're disappointed in the verdict And our attorney has advised us there are grounds for an appeal and we are considering it.'' <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> sued <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>, claiming she breached her contract by quitting the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> show `` Valerie.'' A countersuit by <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> and her husband contended she was wrongfully fired from the show. <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> offered extensive testimony depicting <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> as a temperamental star who wanted complete creative control. Miss <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> testified she wanted input on creative decisions but was not trying to wrest complete control. She had stressed that she brought the concept of the `` Valerie'' series to <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and expected to help shape the episodes. She claimed the writers and producers changed the show to minimize her role and focus on the teen-age boys in the series. <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> replaced Miss <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> on the show, which was retitled `` The <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> Family.''

<HEAD>Court Says EPA Need Not Recalculate Mileage Data</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A federal appeals court reversed two previous court decisions and let stand Friday changes the government imposed three years ago in the way automobile fuel economy is tested. Critics of the 1985 changes by the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> had charged that the changes had allowed automakers to save millions of dollars in penalties for failing to meet fuel economy standards. A three-judge panel and later the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> had ruled in favor of a suit filed by the Center for Auto Safety, challenging the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s 1985 decision, which eased methods used by automakers to determine gas mileage for each of their car models. Those tests are used to determine fleet-wide fuel economy figures that each automaker must meet under separate regulations. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> establishes the fleet average, and if an automaker does not meet the average and does not have credits from past years, it must pay a civil penalty. The full appeals court said Friday that the two previous rulings, in 1986 and last May, were in error. As a result, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> testing procedures imposed in 1985 will stand. The full, 11-member appeals court said that it had not been determined that the Center for Auto Safety had standing to challenge the regulatory change by the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, noting that the court that issued the earlier decision had been sharply divided on that issue. The ruling last May in favor of the Center for Auto Safety suit came in a 5-5 vote. `` We now hold that as a majority of the ... court was unable to satisfy itself that the court had jurisdiction, the court should not have taken any affirmative action on the merits -LRB- of the case -RRB-,'' the court said Friday. The issue involves testing methods used by the automakers for determining the fuel economy of each car model. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 agreed to allow a series of technical changes in those methods which critics said made it easier for the manufacturers to attain higher mileage figures and, in turn, made it easier to meet fleet-wide fuel economy requirements. As a result, the suit argued, manufacturers such as <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which were having difficulty meeting the fuel economy requirements anyway, saved millions of dollars in penalties. `` The effect of today's decision is to let <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> off the hook from having to pay any penalties for failing to comply with fuel economy standards in previous model years,'' said <PERSON> Cornish </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitchcock </PERSON>, an attorney for the Center for Auto Safety. The automakers welcomed the appeals court decision. `` It reinstates <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s original rule-making, which <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> believes did account for the effects of changing test procedures on our corporate average fuel economy,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Buist </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s automotive emissions and fuel economy office in <LOCATION> Dearborn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Noack </PERSON>, a Washington-based spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>, said the company `` welcomed the decision'' but said it would have no effect on <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s fleet-wide fuel efficiency performance for 1988 through 1990 models Federal law requires a 27.5 miles per gallon fleet-wide fuel economy standards for 1989-90 model cars, but <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> has proposed lowering that to 26.5 mpg. It has lowered it to 26 mpg in each of the past three model years, arguing that consumer demand for large, less fuel efficient cars, make the 27.5 standard difficult for automakers to reach.

<HEAD>Congressmen Ask EPA to Hold Off on Superfund Study</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Sixteen congressional committee chairmen, subcommittee chairman and ranking Republicans asked the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> on Friday not to begin a major study of the `` Superfund'' toxic waste cleanup program so late in the administration. `` The agency should concentrate its full energy and resources on implementing'' amendments to the cleanup law passed in 1986 `` rather than on reopening many policy questions which were hotly contested during enactment and during reauthorization less than two years ago,'' the leaders wrote to <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>. `` Second, it is inappropriate to spend Superfund money to undertake a costly Superfund reauthorization study during the final days of this administration,'' the group said. The agency had planned to give the <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> $ 2.5 million for a study to define issues that should be dealt with in the Superfund program. Environmentalists had objected that such a study really should be done as part of the congressional work leading to renewal of the law in 1991. `` Any long-term Superfund study going beyond data gathering should be developed by the next administration,'' the chairmen said. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> DeRemer </PERSON>, an aide to <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, said the agency had to study the letter before replying but it appeared that `` they have misunderstood some of the purposes of the study.'' He said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> wanted an examination of all hazardous waste issues, not just Superfund. He noted that <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, in a Thursday conversation with reporters, had said most Superfund issues could be characterized as both `` policy'' and `` implementation'' issues, such as the question of `` how clean is clean'' standards. In that conversation, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> noted, `` I have n't had anybody yet come to me and say, ` <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, this is a dumb idea.''' However, he said `` we probably wo n't'' proceed if environmental groups decline to serve on the study steering committee. `` The issues are going to be the same in any administration,'' <PERSON> DeRemer </PERSON> said. `` There is no reason to wait. Changes can always be made in the new administration.''

 Advocates for the homeless told a federal judge Friday that the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> violated the law by selling foreclosed homes to the highest bidder without determining whether they could be used by the homeless and low-income people. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON>, representing the coalition of advocates for the homeless, told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON> that <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> receives 70,000 single-family houses each year _ about 7,000 a month _ but the agency `` can not proceed as if it is simply in the real estate business. They must consider the homeless.'' In a related case, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Homeless </ORGANIZATION> also argued that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has defied a congressional mandate to release underutilized federal property as housing for the nation's homeless. Ms. <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Foscarinis </PERSON>, a coalition attorney, said, `` There are thousands of properties underutilized which could be used for the homeless.'' She said that of the 12 facilities have been identified as underutilized by the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, only two have been made available to the homeless. Government attorney <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> argued that the 1987 <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> Homeless Assistance Act _ named after the late <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> congressman who was a leading promoter of the measure _ does not apply to single-family dwellings. `` They want to shut down a program that has been going on for 50 years,'' <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> said. `` They want to tie up the program.'' <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>, another government lawyer, said all the agencies have complied with the provisions of the Homeless Act. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was trying to match up the needs of the homeless with the properties available,'' he said. `` It is not a perfect match.'' <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON>, who heard three separate cases brought by homeless advocates against the government, took them under advisement, saying he would decide as soon as he can whether to issue preliminary injunctions. <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> told the judge that two temporary restraining orders issued last month preventing <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> from auctioning off its foreclosed single-family homes were to expire at the end of business Friday. <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON> merely said, `` I would hope they would maintain the status quo.'' <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> general counsel <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON> said the federal agency would follow the restraining order voluntarily until the end of business next Wednesday. It was anticipated that <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON> would decide the case by then. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> has said that it generally sells the homes to the highest bidders _ frequently investors _ but insists that it has several programs designed to help homeless people find places to live. Recently, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> has been selling an average of 7,100 properties each month _ houses that had <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> mortgage insurance and that went into foreclosure when their owners could no longer keep up the mortgage payments. The program has produced some $ 2.4 billion in proceeds since Oct. 1, 1987, the start of the current fiscal year. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials have argued that the court decisions, if upheld, could cost the agency $ 3 billion a year and bankrupt its single-family mortgage insurance fund. The <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, in a friend-of-the-court brief, said if <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON> issued an injunction, it would interfere with the orderly and efficient way <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> replenishes and restores the actuarial soundness of the <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> program. The association said it would reduce future refunds of premiums paid by current FHA-insured home owners, increase premiums of future <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> homeowners, `` make single-family programs unavailable or less attractive to prospective home buyers,'' and reduce the opportunities of home ownership for individuals and families in the future.

 Supporters of President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> launched a new pro-administration political party Friday, but she said the move must not be allowed to divide democratic forces. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> hailed the formation of Struggle of the Democratic Filipino, the latest step in the realignment of forces that toppled President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' 20-year regime and propelled her to power in February 1986. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> made the remarks in a speech to the first national convention of the party. `` Perhaps it is time to have political parties,'' she said in a speech opening its first convention. `` Perhaps indeed, the time for realignment is now. Yet, I hope that these realignments do not portend the permanent and total division of the forces of democracy in our country. For should that happen, it will mean the end of all of us.'' She said divisions among pro-democracy Filipinos enabled <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, now in exile in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, to impose eight years of martial law in 1972 and prolong his rule. `` It is good for the country and for democracy if people with shared ideals and programs organize themselves into separate parties,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said. `` But it would be disastrous if we divided ourselves again into permanent hostile camps.'' Rep. <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitra </PERSON>, speaker of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>, was elected president of the new party, which organizers hope will bring together pro-government forces under a single banner and serve as the president's party. In February 1986 Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> ran for president under the banner of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> UNIDO </ORGANIZATION>, the party of her running mate, <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Laurel </LOCATION>. Since then, Vice President <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> has criticized Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s policies, <ORGANIZATION> UNIDO </ORGANIZATION> has fared poorly at the ballot box and many of the party's legislators have defected to pro-Aquino parties. Last month Laurel formed an opposition movement, the Union for National Action. He accused Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> of incompetence and urged her to resign to make way for new elections but he received little popular support. Some pro-Aquino politicians say formation of the Struggle for the Democratic Filipino is a bid by the president's relatives and others to consolidate their own power before the 1992 presidential election. Among the party's main organizers is Rep. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Cojuangco </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s influential younger brother. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, who has vowed not to seek re-election, told more than 5,000 delegates that she hoped the party was organized `` not only for the 1992 elections but to help our people face and overcome their problems.'' She said Filipinos were disenchanted with traditional political parties and the bickering and constant jockeying for positions. Political parties in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> traditionally revolved around personalities rather than ideology. <PERSON> Mitra </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> avoided giving the party a ringing endorsement because she did not want to be accused of playing politics. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said she was not favoring the party over other parties in the government coalition and would keynote their conventions if invited. <PERSON> Mitra </PERSON> said Thursday that the party was organized to consolidate political support for the government and establish a grass-roots, mass movement behind Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. `` But there are others who do not believe in this thinking,'' <PERSON> Mitra </PERSON> said. He was referring to the refusal of 18 <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to join the new party. The Liberals, led by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Jovito </PERSON> <PERSON> Salonga </PERSON>, are among six parties in the government coalition. But the Liberals have disagreed with other pro-government parties and with some of the president's influential relatives.

 The army imposed curfews Friday on 180,000 Arabs living in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> refugee camps to prevent violence after activists called a general strike to mark the 1982 massacre of hundreds of Palestinians in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. In southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, troops fatally shot three <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas who the army said planned to attack Israeli settlements. A <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> official told an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> daily the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> wants to negotiate peace but would not abandon attacks against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Police questioned <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> peace crusader <PERSON> Abie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON>, who met this week with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> in violation of Israeli law. <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON>, 61, was released on $ 3,000 bail. `` I violated the law to promote peace and ... I'm ready to pay the price,'' said <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON>, a former fighter pilot and owner of the pirate radio station <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION>. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, troops fired at <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> stone-throwers, critically wounding a 14-year-old boy in the stomach, hospital officials said. The army said it was checking the report. The army denied another report by <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> hospital officials that <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troop gunfire wounded a Palestinian in <LOCATION> Jabaliya </LOCATION> refugee camp outside <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. A 25-year-old Jewish woman was hit by a rock and suffered a skull fracture while driving past <LOCATION> Dahariyeh </LOCATION> south of <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> on her way home to a settlement near <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lunenfeld </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <LOCATION> Beersheba </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Soroka </LOCATION> hospital. Also Friday, the army banned distribution of the pro-PLO <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fajr </ORGANIZATION> newspaper in the occupied territories for 45 days, the military government announced. It said the paper, based in <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, violated the law by publishing `` a very anti-Semitic cartoon depicting a Jew as a Nazi'' without submitting the cartoon to military censors. At least 266 Palestinians and six Israelis have been killed since the Palestinian uprising began Dec. 8 in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Pro-PL0 leaders of the uprising called a general strike for Saturday to mark the sixth anniversary of the slayings of hundreds of Palestinians by Israeli-allied Christian militiamen in the <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> refugee camps <PERSON> Sabra </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Chatilla </LOCATION>. The army imposed indefinite curfews on the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> refugee camps Bureij, Jabaliya, Nuseirat, <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON> and Shati to prevent clashes during the anniversary, confining 180,000 Palestinians to their homes. Four <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> villages also were under curfew. In <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, Islamic militants belonging to the underground group <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION>, or Zeal, painted graffiti calling on merchants to observe the strike. One slogan, written in <LOCATION> Hebrew </LOCATION> and Arabic, read `` Death to the Jews,'' Arab witnesses said. The three guerrillas killed in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> belonged to <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> faction, the largest in the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said. The squad carried Soviet-made Kalashnikov rifles equipped with silencers and apparently was planning to attack border settlements in northern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the report said. An army patrol spotted the guerrillas on the northern slopes of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dov </LOCATION> on the Israeli-Lebanese border and opened fire, the army said. The Israeli troops did not suffer casualties. The clash was inside <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-proclaimed security zone, a six - to-10-mile-wide strip north of the border It is patrolled by about 1,000 Israeli troops and an equal number of Israeli-backed Lebanese militiamen. In an interview published Friday in the <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> daily, <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bassam </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> said the organization would not cease acts of violence against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> or call a halt to the uprising. `` Military operations that have been carried out against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> army, will definitely continue as an act of resistance,'' <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> said. But he also said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> was ready to `` deal with any representatives of the Israelis who are courageous enough to sit and talk and negotiate peace.'' <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> was interrogated for 90 minutes by police in the <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> suburb of <ORGANIZATION> Petah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tikva </ORGANIZATION>. Police officials said that once the investigation is completed, it is up to the state attorney to determine whether <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> should stand trial. <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> could face up to three years in prison for violating a 1986 law that bars Israelis from meeting with members of terror groups. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> considers the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> a terror group. <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON>, who made millions selling hamburgers in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> before becoming a peace activist, said he did n't think he broke the law because he met with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> to promote peace. As <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> arrived at the police station, about 20 members of the anti-Arab Kach movement waved an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> flag and shouted: `` A rope for the traitor.'' <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> turned to the demonstrators and tapped his index finger against his temple to show he thought they were stupid. <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> said he requested a meeting with Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> to brief him on what <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said he would not see the activist, but told reporters one of his assistants might receive <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON>.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took his patriotic road show to this northwest <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> community Friday, where some sponsors of the local `` Flag City Festival'' complained that he turned the non-partisan event into a Republican photo opportunity. The GOP presidential nominee told about 1,000 people waving flags outside the <ORGANIZATION> Elks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lodge </ORGANIZATION> that `` the flag is back'' and rambled into a paraphrase of the Pledge of Allegiance during his half-hour speech. `` I wish the cynics around our country on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> could be in Findlay today to see the outpouring of patriotism,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I thrill to the site of the flag. I've seen it burned by enemies abroad and scorned by the misguided in our country. And I've seen it wrapped around the coffins of young men,'' he said. `` What is it all about? It's the symbol of these <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and to the liberty for which it stands, one nation under God with freedom and justice for all. And let's never forget it.'' <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, a local businessman, protested in an interview that `` what was intended to be a non-partisan promotion of fun and patriotism has turned into a partisan use of the flag for private gain by a candidate.'' <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Fout </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> End </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merchants </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, also expressed annoyance that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would `` come charging in with ` I pledge allegience' and all that stuff, and take a lot of credit away from us.'' The event was conceived by local merchants to celebrate patriotism and town spirit. <PERSON> Fout </PERSON> said <PERSON> Findlay </PERSON> officially calls itself <LOCATION> Flag </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Local Democrats planned to hold a `` pro-flag rally'' after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s visit to `` promote the flag as a non-partisan symbol that belongs to all of us,'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> advisory committee recommended Friday that medical research using tissue from intentionally aborted human fetuses receive federal backing. Although all the votes taken by the 21-member panel of outside medical, ethical, religious and legal experts were tentative, the panel's chairman acknowledged at a news conference that he could not visualize a reversal of the fundamental recommendation. The vote to `` recommend that research proceed'' was 19-0 with two abstentions. The recommendation sets up a possible confrontation with the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> where one adviser to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has made clear he wants to push for an executive order banning federal involvement in such research. However, it remains unclear whether that stance by adviser <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON> has direct support from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> or other top administration officials. Health and Human Services Secretary <PERSON> Otis </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> told reporters Thursday he has no intention of taking a position on the matter until <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> officials have conducted a full review and said that could take several months. <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> said that while he is personally opposed to abortion, the procedure is legal and suggested it would be a `` waste'' not to use fetal tissue for treating Parkinson's and similar diseases. <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> also said it was unclear to him whether <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON>'s memo reflected <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s wishes of the adviser's own. The committee chairman, retired federal appeals Judge <PERSON> Arlin </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, defended the makeup of the panel, which has been criticized by some anti-abortionists as being skewed in favor of allowing fetal tissue research. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said he helped pick the panel and did so without knowledge of the members' personal views on abortion. He said a reading of his own opinions while a judge would reflect that he was `` very concerned about abortion.'' `` I did n't know how I was going to vote until I had heard the testimony,'' said <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, who voted in favor of allowing the research. Dr. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, head of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at <LOCATION> Brigham </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, acknowledged that fundamental questions about the morality of abortion were `` in the background hovering over us all the time.'' <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, chairman of the scientific issues portion of the committee meetings, said it was a testimony to the intellect of the committee members that even some of those with personal reservations about abortion were able to divorce those beliefs from the question of whether the remains from legal abortions could ethically be used in research. `` The key to the three-day meeting was `` can you divorce the two,'' he said. `` It was a kind of tug of war whether you could or could not divorce it.'' After spending several hours Thursday night and most of the day Friday discussing the fundamental question of whether it would be acceptable ethically to use purposely aborted fetal tissue in research, the panel was left little time to consider details of the safeguards it concluded must accompany such a policy. It did reach agreement that `` a pregnant woman should not be induced to terminate pregnancy in order to furnish fetal tissue for transplantation or medical research.'' It also agreed that the mother's decision to have an abortion should be kept separate from her decision to allow the remains to be used for research and that guidelines must be drawn to avoid commercialization of fetal tissue, perhaps similar to the rules governing the handling of hearts, kidneys and other organs used for transplant. As part of those basic guidelines, the panel suggested that anonymity be maintained between the donor and recipient and that the timing and method of abortion not be influenced by potential uses of the fetus for research. Although there was a distinct consensus on what safeguards the committee wants to see in its final recommendations, most were not put in writing. `` I'm not even sure what I voted on because I voted on so many principles without words,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> law professor <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> A </PERSON>. King. Her point, made with a smile, was not to complain about the procedure but to embrace <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' plan to have the committee staff reduce the panel's work to writing as soon as possible to make sure there were no misunderstandings before final votes are taken. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> recessed the meeting late Friday until an unspecified future date. He said the issues were too important to rush and that the panel would have to meet again to finish its work in time to make its formal and written recommendations to a standing <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> advisory committee by Dec. 1. Neither <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> would be drawn into expressing their views about assertions attributed to <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON> suggesting the panel's work might have little bearing on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s eventual decision on whether to issue an executive order banning federal participation in fetal tissue research `` Because it's an election year, I think it's very difficult to comment on why people do what they do,'' said <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>. He did say that for the government to form an advisory committee and then make a decision before the panel had completed its work would `` fly in the face of the usefulness'' of appointing the committee in the first place.

<TEXT>
 Police declined to comment Friday on the death of a man captured after he and three other hijackers seized a bus carrying 70 pilgrims to see Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> II. Three hijackers and a passenger were killed outright when police stormed the bus Wednesday night and a second passenger died later of his wounds. Several rescued hostages said the surviving gunman tried to mingle with the passengers but was pointed out to police who seized him. The witnesses said he did not appear to be seriously hurt. The government announced on Thursday that the man had died but gave no details about the death, nor did it indicate why he died in police custody a day after the gunfight. Several foreign journalists said they saw the man's body in a hospital morgue and it appeared his throat had been cut and his jaw smashed. The two slain passengers were a 14-year-old girl, killed instantly, and a man, 55, who died Thursday. Officials said 21 other people were wounded by bullets and by shrapnel from the hijackers' grenades. The hijackers had identified themselves as members of the <ORGANIZATION> Lesotho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and demanded a meeting with the pope and King <PERSON> Moshoeshoe </PERSON> II. They said they were fighting to end military rule in <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, touring southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, left <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION> Friday after a 36-hour stay marred by the hijacking and bad weather. <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION> is surrounded by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, and a special South African police unit was asked to help deal with the hijackers.

<HEAD>Heir To German Castle Finds There Is A Catch</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FERRYSBURG, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A businessman recently adopted by a German baron has a kingsize worry: a $ 3 million mortgage that he must repay by next month to keep a bank from seizing the family castle. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hemmelsbach </PERSON>, however, is confident that his plans to turn the 1,428-year-old, 100-bedroom castle into a hotel will go forward before the bank acts. `` We need to keep the castle in the family; that's where it belongs,'' said <PERSON> Hemmelsbach </PERSON>, the owner of two small marketing companies here. <PERSON> Hemmelsbach </PERSON> was adopted last month by the <PERSON> Baron </PERSON> <PERSON> Freiherr </PERSON> <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Liebieg </PERSON> after the heirless baron conducted a nationwide search for an heir on the syndicated television show `` A Current Affair.'' The <PERSON> Hemmelsbach </PERSON> family and the baron's family had known each other 40 years ago, after World War II, and the baron recognized <PERSON> Hemmelsbach </PERSON>'s name from among about 10,000 people who wrote asking to inherit the castle. The new Baron <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Liebieg </PERSON> <PERSON> Hemmelsbach </PERSON> said Friday he is negotiating with a major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hotel chain interested in renovating a portion of the castle and turning it into a first-class hotel, and he is confident a deal with the company would secure the $ 3 million. If <PERSON> Hemmelsbach </PERSON> does not pay off the $ 3 million by Oct. 15, the bank holding the mortgage will offer the estate to other parties who have already expressed interest in buying it. `` We need to keep the castle in the family; that's where it belongs,'' <PERSON> Hemmelsbach </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Liebieg </PERSON>, who lives about 15 miles from the castle, began his search for an heir to maintain the deteriorating estate after the bank recently repossessed it from a German businessman to whom von <PERSON> Liebieg </PERSON> sold the castle 15 years ago. The businessman also had planned to turn the castle into a hotel, but financial troubles forced him to abandon his plans, <PERSON> Hemmelsbach </PERSON> said. The castle, reportedly the oldest in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, is located on the banks of the <LOCATION> Mosel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> at the base of the <LOCATION> Eifel </LOCATION> mountains. <PERSON> Hemmelsbach </PERSON> would not name the company interested in developing the property, but said several others and a group of investors were waiting in the wings if the deal falls through. He said he believed it would cost between $ 9 million and $ 12 million to renovate the castle, which sits on 100 acres. He said the castle, accompanying estate and vineyards are worth $ 10 million. Meanwhile, he is selling one of his marketing companies so he can devote his time to raising funds and expect to make his third trip to the castle within three weeks. `` It was love at first sight,'' <PERSON> Hemmelsbach </PERSON> said of the estate.

<HEAD>State Says Communities Must Educate Homeless Children</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The state Education Department says communities are responsible for the education of children living within their boundaries, even if they live in temporary shelters, state parks or other temporary situations. The policy was issued Thursday after the <ORGANIZATION> Hingham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> refused to allow four children in a family living temporarily in tents in <LOCATION> Wompatuck </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> to attend <LOCATION> Hingham </LOCATION> schools. <ORGANIZATION> Hingham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> Superintendent <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> had said the park was considered to be under state jurisdiction and that town taxpayers support school districts. <LOCATION> Hingham </LOCATION> is about 10 miles of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Hingham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. The children have been going to school this month in nearby <LOCATION> Norwell </LOCATION>, where the school committee voted unanimously to let them attend school without paying out-of-town tuition. State Education Commissioner <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Raynolds </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said in a statement that the law entitles all children to attend the public schools in the towns in which they live. `` That law applies to children irrespective of their living situation, whether they live with parents or other relatives in foster homes or in temporary shelters or motels because they have been displaced from their homes,'' he said. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Melikian </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said it is up to <PERSON> John </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, who are living with five children, four of school age, in three tents in the state park, to decide whether to transfer the children from <LOCATION> Norwell </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Hingham </LOCATION> schools. The parents said they would like to keep the children in <LOCATION> Norwell </LOCATION> schools. `` <LOCATION> Norwell </LOCATION> has been so incredibly gracious with our kids,'' said <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>. The Montgomerys moved from <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, in late August to be near Mrs. <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>'s father. While <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> has found a job, and his wife also hopes to work, they have not found affordable housing.

 <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> nuclear power plant officials said Friday that preparations for low-power testing will begin immediately following a <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> vote to clear a major obstacle toward a license. But opponents declared the fight to stop <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> from operating is far from over. At a news conference, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION>, hailed Friday's <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> action as `` another major step forward for <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON>.'' He said <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> will require about five weeks of preparation before the plant would be ready to begin testing at 5 percent power. Actual issuance of the license could take another four weeks, and atomic tests could begin two weeks after that, he estimated. The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>, by a 4-0 vote, approved a rule change that emergency sirens do not have to be in place before low-power testing begins, but the commission left open the question of whether <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON>'s owners are financially qualified to conduct the tests `` I'll say without absolutely no qualification whatsoever there is no hazard to public safety from low-power testing _ absolutely none,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said in regard to the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> decision to allow the testing without sirens. Opponents, however, denounced the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> vote as weakening protections to the public. `` The decision again shows the Reagan-Bush administration is so blindly committed to getting <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> on line that public protection does n't matter,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass. `` The administration has placed the short-term economic interests of one utility ahead of the long-term health and safety of citizens living around the plant. Its goal is to get this plant plugged in and turned on before Nov. 8 so that no one can turn it off later.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> denied there was a connection between <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON>'s plans and the November election, saying the timing is `` pure coincidence.'' <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the Democratic presidential nominee, has been a longtime opponent of <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION>. He denounced the latest decision in a prepared statement saying, `` The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> _ the <ORGANIZATION> Not </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Responsible </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> _ is experiencing a meltdown in its thinking process.'' Regarding <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON>'s finances, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> predicted that a final agreement will be in place within several weeks to cover payments being skipped by the owner of the fourth largest <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> share, <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wholesale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> also said he doubts that the bankruptcy judge overseeing <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s reorganization would block low-power testing once he `` hears the facts on low-power and not the myths. However, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Moughan </PERSON>, of Citizens Within The 10-Mile Radius, said <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to deal with financial questions later means the fight is n't over. `` We think the public needs to understand that the full-power -LRB- license -RRB- possibilities are distant still,'' he said.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> pledged Friday to double the number of federal drug agents over the next five years as he charged the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration with using a `` nickel and dime'' approach to the war on narcotics. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ridiculed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' attempts to portray himself as a defense-minded candidate. `` You can not fool the Soviet leadership by knocking <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s defense for 10 years and then riding around in a tank for 10 minutes,'' the vice president said, referring to his Democratic rival's visit earlier in the week to a tank design facility in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> `` You ca n't fool the American people.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> played tough in his television commercials, as well, airing an advertisement in <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' home state of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> that accused him of failing to clean up polluted <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. The vice president headed for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> after a three-city tour of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, while <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was flying home to <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> on Saturday night. Both men have set aside large parts of next week to prepare for their first debate of the fall presidential campaign, a 90-minute nationally televised session a week from Sunday in <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> Democrat <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has spent much of the week trying to regain the momentum in the race for the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, and his tough anti-crime speech in a visit to the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> was part of that effort. In what has become the standard made-for-television element of every campaign day, he observed officer <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulford </PERSON> demonstrate `` cover and concealment'' tactics at a simulated street scene. <PERSON> Mulford </PERSON> ducked behind wooden boxes and a brick wall and fired at various moving and pop-up targets. Normally, live ammunition is used in such exercises, but the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> protecting <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> vetoed that idea. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he would assign the first 100 new drug agents to <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. And he said he would double the total number of agents nationally over the next five years. `` We are going to hire the state and local law enforcement officers the money to fight the war,'' he said. `` We are not going to try to nickel and dime you to death, as this administration has done.'' Aides said he was prepared to spend $ 50 million to hire new agents next year toward a five-year goal of 2,800 agents, although a fact sheet issued to reporters said the cost of the agents would be offset by seized drug profits. Aides also said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was committed to hiring 800 additional federal prosecutors. `` We're going to send a message to drug kingpins,'' he said. `` As far as <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is concerned, there's nowhere you can run; there's nowhere you can sail; there's nowhere you can hide; there will be no safe haven for dope peddlers and drug profits anywhere on this earth.'' But while making an appearance at a <LOCATION> Chula </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vista </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, police station, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was greeted by pro-Bush demonstrators, some wearing striped mock prison uniforms and chanting, `` Let me out, I'll kill again.'' The chant referred to the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor's furlough program, since modified, that enabled a convicted killer to go to another state and rape a woman. Other demonstrators recited the Pledge of Allegiance in a dig at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' veto of a constitutionally doubtful bill requiring <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> teachers to lead students in the pledge. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> used his first news conference in two weeks to try and blunt some of the work <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did earlier in the week to buttress his own defense credentials. He opened with a statement saying the tank <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> rode in `` did not fit.'' Later, he said, `` He's gone to states like this, found that his message of.. cutting unilaterally on these weapons systems is not popular and so now he's been made over He's coming out with policies quite different, but which ones do you believe?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> delivered a speech in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> earlier this week in which he renewed his opposition to some weapons, but pledged support for others and criticized the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for not devoting enough attention to tanks and other conventional weapons. The vice president, who has moved up markedly in the polls in the last few weeks, acknowledged that some of his aides do not want him to take questions from reporters for fear it would distract from campaign themes he stresses in his other appearances. `` It's just some lower-level hand-wringers who think I'm going to screw up,'' he said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaigned at a <LOCATION> Buckeye </LOCATION> Steel mill in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, where he noted his grandfather, <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, was one of the firm's founders In a speech seemingly aimed at Democrats who voted for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1980 and 1984 _ a key bloc of voters in the industrial <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stressed his opposition to gun control and abortion and his support for prayer in schools and capital punishment. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also rambled into a paraphrase of the pledge during a flag-draped appearance in Findlay, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, where he paid tribute to the American flag. `` It's the symbol of these <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and to the liberty for which it stands, one nation under God with freedom and justice for all. And let's never forget it,'' he said. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, members of the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rainbow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> stressed unity during a news conference in which they announced a stepped-up registration and get-out-the-vote effort. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, the general election coordinator for the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign, said the drive targets 42 cities in 14 states. The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> will `` take the lead'' in the campaign, which will try to register 2 million new voters and win 70 percent black voter participation in the Nov. 8 election. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s appearance in Findlay at a Flag City Festival drew criticism from some of the event's organizers who said they had intended it to be a non-partisan event. The campaign understudies were hunting votes, as well. Republican vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> poked fun at himself and the controversy that has dogged him. `` Sometimes they tell you to go to your room,'' the 41-year-old <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator said of his aides, some of whom are older than he is. Democrat <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> criticized <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for having a `` bad case of laryngitis'' when it comes to leadership.

The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor was in town to attend a fund-raiser and a celebrity summit at the home of television producer <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Lear </PERSON>.

 Democratic candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> promised Friday to double the number of drug enforcement agents and vowed `` there will be no safe haven for dope peddlers and drug profits anywhere on this earth.'' The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor delivered a tough anti-crime speech during an appearance at the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>, where he observed a training exercise on a simulated city street called <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON>'s Alley. While <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> stood a few feet away, Officer <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulford </PERSON> demonstrated `` cover and concealment'' tactics, ducking behind wooden boxes and a brick wall and fired at various moving and pop-up targets. Trainees usually use live ammunition in such exercises, but the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> vetoed the practice during <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' visit. In his speech, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told police recruits that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration was trying to `` nickel and dime you to death'' by cutting funds for drug enforcement. `` We're going to give the state and local law enforcement officers the money they need to fight this war,'' he said. `` You're the ones who take the risks, you're the ones who make the busts, you're the ones who bear the costs of this war and you deserve the best equipment and the best communications and the best training we can give you,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. In a later appearance at a <LOCATION> Chula </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vista </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, police station, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was greeted by demonstrators who needled the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor for his since-modified prison furlough policy and for his veto on constitutial grounds of a bill requiring teachers to lead students in the Pledge of Allegiance. One group wore mock prison uniforms and chanted, `` Let me out, I'll kill again,'' and another carried pro-George <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signs and recited the pledge. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said at the police academy he would double the number of <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> efforts over the next five years and added, `` We're going to send the first 100 of those new agents here to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>.'' He said the cost of the new agents would be more than covered by the increased revenue in seized drug profits. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides quoted DEA estimates that each agent seized an average of $ 259,000 in drug profits in 1987, more than double what it cost to keep them in the field. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also pledged to hire 800 more federal prosecutors and to `` wage an all-out effort to hunt down, to freeze and to seize drug profits wherever we can find them.'' `` We're going to send a message to drug kingpins,'' he said. `` As far as <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is concerned, there's nowhere you can run, there's nowhere you can sail, there's nowhere you can hide. There will be no safe haven for dope peddlers and drug profits anywhere on this earth.'' Republican presidential nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has criticized <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for his refusal to endorse <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal for imposing the death penalty on drug kingpins. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> continued his drug war theme during a Mexican Independence Day celebration at <ORGANIZATION> Roosevelt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, an area with a large Mexican-American population. There he told students that under the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration `` at one point, it got so bad, that agents of the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> had to have a bake sale to raise money to finance drug stakeout operations.'' However, aides said afterword that the bake sale, described in a book by <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> entitled `` Desperado,'' was to raise money for drug education programs. `` We need a president in this country who will make a difference and not excuses,'' he told a cheering crowd composed mostly of students. `` I hope many of you will become the future political leaders of this country,'' he said. Hispanics make up 23 percent of the population of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, but only 8 percent of the registered voters.

<TEXT>
 Fires in <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> picked up again Friday, but fire officials were confident moisture from storms last weekend and work since then would prevent the fires from growing. `` This week, I think they're fairly confident, with the measures they've taken during the early part of this week, that they'll be able to hold the fires,'' said fire information officer <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. `` I think they're fairly confident that they wo n't have any major problems.'' The fires, which now form one huge blaze, have affected 1.1 million acres of the 2.2 million-acre park. But according to new infrared scans, they have burned only about 50 percent to 60 percent of the land within fire perimeters. Park officials said the fires remained inside fire perimeters Friday. `` I do n't think anything slopped over any lines,'' said park spokeswoman <PERSON> Sonya </PERSON> <PERSON> Capek </PERSON>. Temperatures in the park only reached the mid-60s and steady winds approached 35 mph. The weather forecast offered some good news for Saturday, with a chance of light snowshowers in the afternoon and temperatures in the 50s. The storm also could bring some heavy winds, but <PERSON> Capek </PERSON> said the high humidity and cold temperatures will keep the fires down. Firefighters had taken advantage of the wet, cold weather earlier in the week to strengthen existing lines around fires and extend lines and by Friday had contained 50 percent of the 335,500-acre North Fork fire, the most troublesome of the blazes in the park. Blazes also burned Friday in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state as the worst fire season in 30 years continued. More than 4 million acres, including 2.1 million acres in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, have gone up in smoke. <PERSON> Denny </PERSON> <PERSON> Bungarz </PERSON>, North Fork fire incident commander, said officials believe it would take seven days of continued dry weather before <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> would return to the tinder-dry conditions that allowed fires to grow by thousands of acres daily. And 700 Marines from <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pendleton </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> reached the park Friday to help with firefighting efforts, bringing the military force in the country's first national park to 4,100. Thirty Canadian firefighters arrived Friday, the first Canadian crew to arrive since the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> accepted that country's offer to help. Firefighters had contained 70 percent of the 413,380-acre Clover Mist fire in the park's northeastern corner. That leaves the <LOCATION> Wolf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> fire, on the northeast edge of the North Fork, as the only fire where containment figures were below 50 percent. Firefighters had contained 8 percent of that blaze. To the south, officials in the <ORGANIZATION> Bridger-Teton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> declared the 225,500-acre Huck-Mink complex of fires fully contained. Wildfires continued to burn in most of <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>'s national forests Friday, and fire bosses welcomed a weekend forecast of cooler, wetter weather. `` I do n't know if we're over the hump as far as the fire season goes, but we've been saying we're guardedly optimistic,'' said <PERSON> Sandi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sacher </PERSON>, an information officer at the <ORGANIZATION> Boise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interagency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. Fires that so far had consumed more than 190,000 acres remained out of control and outside wilderness boundaries in the <LOCATION> Nez </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Perce </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Challis </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION> and Salmon national forests, Ms. <PERSON> Sacher </PERSON> said. Restrictions on the use of several national forests in western <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> were lifted Friday. `` We had enough moisture -LRB- so that -RRB- we dropped down to a moderate'' fire danger, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Krepps </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Meanwhile, a fire in Glacier National Park had grown about 2,000 acres by Friday, and in west-central <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> hundreds of soldiers helped crews mop up the 247,000-acre <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> blaze.

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The 1988 Summer Olympics, the largest and most tightly guarded in history, began in a blaze of pageantry Saturday as marchers in traditional Korean costumes entered the main stadium to the beat of a `` dragon drum.'' About 70,000 spectators in the Olympic Stadium and up to a billion television viewers around the world watched the spectacular show that began at 10:30 a.m. -LRB- 8:30 p.m. EDT Friday -RRB- in sunny weather. It was the first Olympic opening ceremony with a prelude outside the main stadium. Before the performances in the Olylmpic Stadium, a flotilla of 458 boats sailed by on the <LOCATION> Han </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> adjacent to the stadium. The theme of the three-hour extravaganza, with 13,000 performers, was `` Beyond All Barriers'' _ a phrase stressing the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> Games as a stage for the first East-West competitions at the Summer Olympics in 12 years. Political boycotts had marred the 1980 <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Games and the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> competition four years ago. About 160 countries sent nearly 10,000 athletes to the Games to compete for 237 gold medals, making these 16-day Games the best-attended ever by competitors. South Korean security forces ringing the stadium and on alert across the nation were on guard against terrorism. Officals called the measures the most extensive ever to protect a sports event. <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> led the parade of teams, a tradition honoring the country as the site of the ancient Olympics. Teams marched according to the Korean alphabet, with <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION> second in the procession. As the host nation, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> was last. Most teams were garbed in matching jackets and pants or skirts, but African delegations wore native garb of flowing robes with colorful print patterns. The processions seemed less formal than at past Olympics opening ceremonies. Some teams broke ranks to wave to the cheering crowd. An <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> athlete carried a sign proclaiming, `` Hi, Mom, I'm Here. The teams gathered on the infield after circling the running track. The march route took them past the seating area for dignitaries, including South Korean President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo and <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Samaranch </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Olympic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Before the teams marched in, a chorus sang an ancient seafaring ballad, and thousands of blue and white balloons floated skyward. A replica of the huge dragon drum used in ancient Korean ceremonies was transfered from ship to shore then carried to the stadium. Huge balloons were released from a Shindan Tree, sacred in Korean mythology, and then the Olympic flame was revealed on a 72-foot pedestal resembling a traditional Korean candleholder. Korean dancers in Greek tunics and flowing gowns danced and whirled as silver-colored confetti rained down from the sky. `` I believe <PERSON> God </PERSON> is blessing my country for its years of hard work and preparation,'' said <PERSON> Yuk </PERSON> <PERSON> Hee-Jin </PERSON>, 17, a spectator. `` I'm really proud of my country The whole world will now know more about <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>.'' The opening ceremonies, as conceived, planned, practiced and practiced again, were designed by the Games' hosts to portray the Eastern philosophies of harmony and balance _ factors long-wanting in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s tumultuous history. Planners drew from the concept of <PERSON> Yin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yang </PERSON>, the symbol on the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> flag that is also a major Oriental philosophy. <PERSON> Yin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> represent opposing forces that come together in a bond of harmony and friendship. So the script for the Olympic opener mixed the Yin of the old and the Yang of the new. Music for the show came from ancient Korean drums and wind instruments as well as a synthesizer that pumped out modern pieces composed by contemporary Korean artists. The Koreans invited dancers from 60 nations to participate in the program of native dances from <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other nations. Music to accompany the marchers was composed from folk music of the various nations. The Koreans also sought to keep harmony among the nations marching in the opening ceremony. Plans to limit the number in the process were quickly scrapped after protests from several countries, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. And while the program called for women in flowing white robes to march in front of the delegations carrying signs with each nation's name, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was granted its wish that a man front their team because of the Moslem nation's strict fundamentalist tenets that forbid women from such public displays On Friday, a runner carried the Olympic torch to <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> in a snowstorm of confetti, streamers and balloons. The torch relay began Aug. 23 in <LOCATION> Olympia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, site of the ancient Olympics. Elsewhere in the capital, hundreds of radicals staged anti-Olympic protests at three universities Friday. They burned the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag and an effigy of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and yelled `` Down with the dictators' Olympics!'' Onlookers shouted at them as riot police watched from a distance. In the protests, radicals, some of them armed with firebombs and clubs, demanded the Olympics be shared with communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and charged the Games were being used to cement authoritarian rule in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> declared again Friday that the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> government is using the Games to further divide the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula. The two Koreas have been divided since the end of World War II and fought the Korean War in 1950-53.

 Israeli troops and allied <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> militiamen backed by helicopter gunships mounted a two-pronged assault against <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> moslem and leftist guerrillas in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> on Friday, police reported. A police spokesman said at least three Lebanese villagers were wounded and more than 10 houses sustained severe damage in the attack. It was apparently aimed at blunting increased guerrilla activity against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. At least two helicopter gunships flew several strafing runs in the fields around the two villages attacked, said the spokesman, who can not be identified under standing regulations. A police spokesman said troops and militiamen in 14 armored cars and armored personnel carriers rolled into the Shiite Moslem village of Mimes, three miles north of the security zone, at 4:30 p.m. -LRB- 9:30 a.m. EDT -RRB-. Another force of 15 armored cars and armored personnel carriers attacked simultaneously the Shiite village of <LOCATION> Ain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atta </LOCATION> in the foothills of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hermon </LOCATION>, five miles north of the border enclave, the spokesman said. The spokesman, who can not be identified under standing regulations, said at least 250 troops and militiamen were taking part in the operation. In <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, an army spokesman said he knew nothing about the attack. It came only a day after Syrian Defense Minister Gen. <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Tlas </PERSON> inspected Syrian army forward positions in the western <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> valley </LOCATION>, about three miles from the targets of the Israeli attack. The attacking force appeared to be searching for Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas and Syrian-backed leftists who have lately been active against the security zone from the slopes of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hermon </LOCATION>, the spokesman said.

Hurricanes gain their strength from the energy transferred from the warm ocean waters to the air and clouds above. Warmer temperatures caused by the greenhouse effect could lead to more evaporation and heat transfer from the oceans, and thus, possibly stronger storms, he explained.

<HEAD>Norwegians in Dispute over Report that Seals are Skinned Alive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHAN RAPP</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A report that some hunters are skinning seals alive has touched off a bitter dispute in <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, where hunters and fishermen say seal killing is crucial to their way of life. Odd <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindberg </PERSON>, an author and photographer who sailed as a government-appointed inspector on a hunting boat east of <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION> last spring, said in his report that seals were not only skinned alive but killed in deliberately `` sadistical ways.'' The report came as authorities sought to ease controls on seal killing, because fisherman complain that thousands of the animals have invaded <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s northern coast, eating fish and damaging nets. `` Since my report I have received at least 100 telephone threats, with some saying they are going to tear my limbs off,'' said <PERSON> Lindberg </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION>, which employed <PERSON> Lindberg </PERSON> to do the inspection, refuses to accept his report. `` It may be that he -LRB- <PERSON> Lindberg </PERSON> -RRB- believes he has seen things that he has not seen,'' said <PERSON> Trond </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paulsen </PERSON>, a senior ministry official. The ministry has no plans to take action on his report, he said. But the report drew widespread sympathy for seals following a summer of death for the animals further south. A distemper virus killed 13,000 seals along the coasts of <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> since April. <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s leading newspaper, Aftenposten, devoted its front page to a color picture it said was taken by <PERSON> Lindberg </PERSON> of a seal pup in the water being clubbed with the blunt side of a long spiked pole. Killing pups in the water is prohibited, and it would appear from the photo that the hunter had apparently missed a clean kill on the head. In the 1970s, the French actress <PERSON> Birgitte </PERSON> <PERSON> Bardot </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> and other environmental organizations successfully campaigned against seal slaughter here and in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Their campaign led to a 1983 ban by the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> on imports of seal skins, a heavy blow to the seal hunters whose main market was the European fur industry. After the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> import ban, the <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> government banned the killing of seal pups, which are coveted for their white coats. <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s seal hunting fleet dwindled from about 50 vessels to five and the catch was cut from several hundred thousand seals a year to a quota of less than 40,000. However, disgruntled seal hunters now see the chance for a comeback. Later this year, the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> will start talks on the possibilities of either lifting the ban or making it permanent. A decision is expected next year. Last year's seal invasion softened public opinion in <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>. Fishermen complained they could lose their livelihoods if the seals were allowed to continue to eat their catch and destroy their nets. `` We count on the import ban being changed,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauritson </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION>. `` There are no logical, scientific grounds for it.'' <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> hunts seals during the spring in waters east of <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION> and in the <LOCATION> Barents </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, north of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lindberg </PERSON> was one of three inspectors assigned this year to make sure the killings were carried out according to detailed rules, intended to minimize the animals' suffering. He spent from mid-March to mid-April aboard a seal hunt vessel off <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lindberg </PERSON> said he turned in his report to the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> at the beginning of July and that it created `` panic.'' `` The animals are rarely checked to see if they have been fatally shot,'' the report said, `` and are often alive when they are hoisted aboard. As a result it often happens that the animal is skinned while growling, its eyes pleading and its mouth snapping at you.'' He said he had seen animals that appeared to be dead but `` woke up'' while being skinned. Before releasing <PERSON> Lindberg </PERSON>'s report Sept. 2, the ministry issued a statement saying a committee of experts had found <PERSON> Lindberg </PERSON> `` not trustworthy.'' Other inspectors made no such complaints, said <PERSON> Paulsen </PERSON>. Officials said no formal qualifications are needed to be an inspector, but that they usually employ biologists, students and researchers. They said <PERSON> Lindberg </PERSON> had offered to do the job without pay. <PERSON> Lindberg </PERSON>, 43, has specialized in conditions for marine mammals in polar areas.

<HEAD>Nationalist Chinese Military Assailed as Too Powerful</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANNIE HUANG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Nationalist Chinese military, long the backbone of the government, is under attack by critics who contend it remains too powerful at a time of easing tensions with rival communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Emboldened by the relaxed political atmosphere on <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> after nearly four decades of authoritarian rule, some Taiwanese claim the military abuses its power despite the lifting of martial law here a year ago. Newspapers, which customarily hushed up any allegations of military wrongdoing in the past, now give wide coverage to the charges of abuses. The Nationalist government and armed forces led by <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Kai-shek </PERSON> fled to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> in 1949 after losing a civil war to the communists on the mainland and remain technically at war with <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> still regards <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> as a renegade province but has not launched a significant military action since 1958, when communist forces fired hundreds of thousands of artillery shells at two tiny Nationalist-held offshore islands, <LOCATION> Quemoy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Matsu </LOCATION>. `` Soldiers used to be admired for defending the country with their lives,'' said legislator <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shih-liang </PERSON> of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` But with the absence of wars for so long, people began to question what they have been doing.'' A central figure in the controversy is <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s only four-star general, <PERSON> Hau </PERSON> <PERSON> Pei-tsun </PERSON>, head of the general chiefs of staff since 1981 and one of those who came to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> after the communists won the mainland in 1949. <PERSON> Hau </PERSON>, who commands <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s half a million troops, was praised for ensuring a peaceful transfer of power after the death in January of President <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Ching-kuo </PERSON>, the son of <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Kai-shek </PERSON>, who lifted martial law despite his strong ties to the military. But critics argue that <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Ching-Kuo </PERSON>'s successor, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Teng-hui </PERSON>, has little control over the armed forces, which are allocated an estimated 46 percent of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s annual budget of nearly $ 20 billion. `` No military officers dared to give an order without the prior approval from <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Ching-kuo </PERSON>, but it appears no one can control them now,'' said <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> <PERSON> Chung-tung </PERSON>, history professor at <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taiwan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, a native Taiwanese, has yet to build up his own power base in the Nationalist military that remains dominated by officers who came from mainland <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. That also has led to speculation that <PERSON> Hau </PERSON>'s influence is growing. Some liberal newspapers and magazines recently criticized <PERSON> Hau </PERSON> on grounds that he promoted several of his own men, including two generals demoted by <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Ching-kuo </PERSON> for dereliction of duty. Newspapers also have suggested that <PERSON> Hau </PERSON> played an influential role in crafting the Nationalist party's new policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that was named in July. The military retained three of 31 committee seats, including one held by <PERSON> Hau </PERSON>. Opposition politicians have assailed the armed forces for their role in trying to crack down on dissent, claiming military police and intelligence agents have appeared at major anti-government demonstrations where only a police presence was appropriate. In August, several dozen members of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> staged a protest in <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION> to demand the impeachment of <PERSON> Hau </PERSON> because a military jail burned the memoirs of a renowned dissident prisoner. The liberal <ORGANIZATION> Independence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evening </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said in an editorial July 27 that with the lifting of martial law `` we thought military personnel would reduce their role to that of defending the state and civilians.'' `` Rather, we saw the military openly intervening in political factional disputes, continuing to have a hand in social and economic affairs and having too much say in government personnel changes,'' it said. A <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> <PERSON> Hui-yuan </PERSON>, called the newspaper's accusations `` malicious slandering'' and `` an insult to our troops.'' To counter the intense criticism, the military has launched a campaign to stress the importance of national defense in speeches and through concerts, plays and television shows, including one showing the 69-year-old Hau swimming, golfing and playing with his grandson. In a speech marking Soldiers' Day on Sept. 3, <PERSON> Hau </PERSON> urged Taiwanese `` not to reduce the sense of crisis while living in comfort,'' claiming that communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> still could invade <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> at any time. Professor <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> reflects widespread sentiment when he labels as unlikely the possibility of a military coup or a military-led campaign to reverse the recent liberalization trend that has permitted political opposition and relaxed unofficial ties with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` Military officers must have realized that the public would not support them in case of a coup,'' he said. `` They must also ask whether they could control the troops before moving to seize power.'' Most of the troops are native Taiwanese, who make up 85 percent of the island's population.

 When Discovery's countdown clock reaches the 9-minute mark on launch day, it will stop automatically and be held there for 10 minutes while one man decides whether to give the final go-ahead for liftoff. He will look to many experts, analyzing every scrap of information, for help. They will report on the condition of the shuttle and its thousands of complex parts, the state of the weather overhead and at prime and emergency landing sites around the globe, the readiness of the launch and flight control teams to support the mission. Before the 10 minutes is up, he will say go or no-go. It is a new and awesome responsibility, a product of the Challenger disaster, and it lies with <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crippen </PERSON>, a 50-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> captain and an astronaut who has gone into space more often on the shuttle than any other person. He piloted the first launch in 1981 and has commanded three other flights. His fellow astronauts are delighted to have one of their own calling that critical shot. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> captain, who will command Discovery on the first shuttle mission since Challenger, said, `` I flew my first mission with him in 1983, and I ca n't think of anyone who is reverse transcriptase, an enzyme the AIDS virus uses to replicate itself and spread through the body. The experiment to grow crystals of the AIDS protein was developed by researchers at <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION> in Research Triangle Park, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials determined it was safe to fly on the shuttle. Another experiment involves taking photographs and video of lightning at night to study relationships between it and other elements such as thunderstorms. Such research may one day lead to better weather forecasting. `` The altitude we fly at gives you kind of a unique perspective. We get a very broad view of thunderstorms. We can see a third of a continent's worth of thunderstorms. It's spectacular,'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said. Astronauts also will photograph the sky immediately after sunset and after sunrise to measure the brightness of Earth's atmosphere at those times. The information can be used to build sensors for future unmanned satellites, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said. The five other experiments consist of two separation processes and three basic research projects that include examining how metal melts and resolidifies in zero gravity, mixing immiscible fluids and watching them separate and studying how blood flows and collects in weightlessness.

There are two notable exceptions: <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Aldrich </PERSON>, one of the <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> bosses who gave final approval for the Jan. 28, 1986, flight, and <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> engineer who argued against the launch but was overruled. <PERSON> Aldrich </PERSON> is director of the shuttle program at <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> headquarters and <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION> is in charge of <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>'s space operations The <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> commission presented its conclusion that Challenger `` was an accident rooted in history,'' but it did not recommend any criminal indictment. Still, Sen. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, D-S.C. demanded that `` every single person be identified and disciplined.'' That seems to have been done without resorting to the courts. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulloy </PERSON>, former manager of the booster rocket program at the Marshall Space Flight Center who had brushed off the Thiokol concerns, and <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Reinartz </PERSON>, manager of shuttle projects who decided not to tell top launch officials about those concerns, both left <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>. So has <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> official who told <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> he was `` appalled'' at the firm's original recommendation that the launch should not take place. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> was working without its chief on the day of the tragedy, and the man with the title of acting administrator was new to the agency. Administrator <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beggs </PERSON> had stepped aside in early December 1985 when he was indicted on charges unrelated to <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>. Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, who had been deputy administrator for only 10 days when <PERSON> Beggs </PERSON> stepped out, had to take the heat for the worst tragedy in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s space program. After Challenger, <PERSON> Beggs </PERSON> resigned and <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> remained as acting administrator until Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> returned in May 1986 from private life and reassumed the job of administrator he had held for eight years in the 1970s. `` Where management is weak, we will strengthen it,'' he promised. `` Where engineering or design processes need improving, we will improve it. Where our internal communications are poor, we will see that they get better.'' The purge had begun much earlier. The first to step down after Challenger was <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, assistant <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> administrator for spaceflight, who had already been named to take over as director of the <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. Truly was summoned from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> to take charge; he proclaimed `` the <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> can-do spirit is intact'' and quickly set out a conservative agenda to get back into the spaceflight business. In the <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> structure, center directors wield considerable power and those directly concerned with shuttle flight were quick to fall. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> remained at Johnson only a few months and left to take an ill-defined headquarters job that lasted six months. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> left the <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> for a private space firm. Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> retired from the <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, which has charge of <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> propulsion systems and received the most criticism from the <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> commission. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> went to the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> for Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Forrest </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON> to head the Kennedy Space Center. At <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> was moved up and <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> got <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, a veteran space engineer, who came back to <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> from <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION>'s Plasma Physics Laboratory. Three of the four <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> officials who overruled their engineers and acceded to the Challenger launch still are with the company but in non-shuttle positions. They are <PERSON> J.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilminster </PERSON>, now in the automotive products division, <PERSON> R.K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lund </PERSON>, vice president of advanced technology; and <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiggins </PERSON>, general manager of the <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION> division. <PERSON> Jerald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, boss of the booster division, retired early. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Boisjoly </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> engineer, said the company harassed him for his strong testimony before the <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> commission and sued <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> for billions of dollars. The case was dismissed and he has left the company long ago.

 `` USA Today: The Television Show,'' TV's bright new `` infotainment'' package, neither informs nor entertains and blows past at the speed of a video game. It's `` nuzak'' _ something that looks like news at a distance but will drive you crazy if you try to pay attention. At the end of the ride the viewer might only remember a bromide such as `` baseball is baseball, even in <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>,'' or feel a gnawing need to know more about the `` sound-emitting chair that provides the equivalent of eight hours sleep in just 20 minutes.'' Factoids are dispensed in the `` snapshots'' which precede the commercials: 6,500 limousines were sold in the <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> in 1985; it costs 49 cents to mail a letter in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, 25 cents in the <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>. `` USA Today: The Television Show'' is the first informational series from Grant Tinker, whose <ORGANIZATION> GTG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> production studio is a joint venture with <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION>, the publisher of <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION>, the newspaper. The syndicated, nightly half-hour news show premiered last Monday on about 160 stations. In most markets, it airs in the early evening. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Leno </PERSON> has joked that <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> is the newspaper for those whose attention span is too short for television. `` USA Today'' on television is no marathon for the mind, but it demands intense attention in short bursts. For instance, viewers have about five seconds to decode an elaborate weather map. RAIN, the map said Tuesday. Where? OK, if you care about the weather you can watch the local news, but then what's the point of flashing the map on `` USA Today''? Is this the art appreciation segment?

 Sometimes `` USA Today'' is goofily inspired, especially in the first show when <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> stood inside an Impressionist painting and then, apparently walking toward a fan that made her hair billow, melded into a beach scene from the film, `` A Man and a Woman.'' <PERSON> Edie </PERSON> <PERSON> Magnus </PERSON> played more tricks on the mind by doing `` live'' interviews with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, after explaining neither one was in the studio. She stood and chatted with a screen, synchronizing her questions to answers taped earlier in the day. The implicit message is that nothing is real, not here anyway. Nor is anything so important that you, the viewer, need to think about it. But why watch? It takes less concentration to watch `` Nova'' or a <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Moyers </PERSON> special on PBS. If you miss the intro to a segment, forget it. Poor sound quality in some of the interviews does n't help either. In a segment Wednesday on the National Geographic, voices were repeatedly smothered by annoying music. Before `` USA Today'' hit the air, it suffered a certain amount of sniping from critics because of its commitment to an upbeat `` journalism of hope'' which accentuated the positive and eliminated the negative. What's been accentuated is pace; coherence and content have been eliminated. You have to give up something to jam 18 topics into the 22 minutes left after commercials. But it's not as though `` <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION>'' tracked mud through the temple of television. CBS' `` 48 Hours'' and `` West 57th'' have blazed a trail for lightweight journalism, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` 20-20'' is infatuated with celebrities and <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>'s `` A Current Affair'' and `` The Reporters'' plumb the lower depths of taste. `` USA Today'' looks less like an innovator than a cross between Trivial Pursuit and `` Entertainment Tonight.''

<HEAD>New USDA Rules for 1989 Aimed at Stopping Subsidy Abuse</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 If all goes well, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s new rules for paying out subsidies under 1989 commodity programs will make those notorious multimillion-dollar handouts to a few super farmers a thing of the past The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> is holding training sessions to explain the new regulations to those involved in administering the programs. Among other things, local, state and federal officials must know who is a farmer and who is not. After years of seeing news reports about huge payments to big operators _ some individuals collected more than $ 4 million in some years _ the government got serious about cracking down. The farm law of 1970 included the first attempt at putting a lid on payments, and there were subsequent modifications as <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> wrote new laws and rewrote others. Usually, it turned out, there were big loopholes. It became almost routine for some large operators to divide holdings among family members or friends, thereby each qualifying for a share of the subsidy pie to circumvent the letter of the law. So the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> tried again, in the Food Security Act of 1985 and again in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987. The 1985 farm law, which is still operative, set a lid of $ 50,000 on the amount of `` deficiency'' payments and land diversion payments, with certain exceptions, that a person could collect in any one year. The law also set an overall $ 250,000 maximum, which included deficiency, disaster and other federal payments. But the abuses continued. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, an investigative agency of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, reported last year that `` individuals and other legal entities can avoid the $ 50,000 payment limitation in a variety of ways.'' The 1987 law set up a payment `` eligibility'' standard as well as a `` limitation'' provision. These are the mainstays of new regulations that <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> recently adopted to carry out the mandate of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to crack down on excessive payments to individuals. A new farm program fact sheet developed by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stabilization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> soon will be circulating to agency offices, farmers and others Here are some of the main points being developed for 1989 crop programs administered by the agency, according to a draft of the report: _ The regulations apply to payments made under the annual programs for wheat, feed grains, upland cotton, extra long staple cotton, rice and honey _ Payments made on land owned by public schools or to states for land owned by a public school district or state, which are used to maintain a public school, are not subject to the rules _ The law requires that before any `` person'' is eligible to receive payments, that person must be `` actively engaged in farming. _ A person can be an individual farmer, an individual who is a member of a joint operation, a corporation, a joint stock company, an association, a limited partnership, a trust, an estate, or a charitable organization _ Husband and wife may be separate `` persons'' if they can show that each brought separate farming operations into their marriage and have maintained them as separate farming operations throughout their marriage The rules also include specifics for cash rent tenants, corporations, trusts, estates and minor children. In defining `` actively engaged'' in farming, the rules require those applying for payments at county <ORGANIZATION> ASCS </ORGANIZATION> offices to provide local governing committees with information to substantiate their active engagement in farming. `` Providing such information is voluntary, but if information is not provided the county committee will not be be to make an ` actively engaged in farming' determination and the producer will be ineligible to receive any payments,'' the report said. In general, it added, to be actively engaged in farming, a person `` has to make a significant contribution of capital, land, labor, and-or equipment to their farming operation, as well as a significant contribution of active personal labor and @ or active personal management.'' The `` significant contribution'' also is spelled out. For example, a significant contribution of active personal labor means that a `` person'' personally provides at least 1,000 hours of labor or at least 50 percent of that person's commensurate share of the total labor necessary in the farming operation. Again, the county committees will determine whether a person is properly contributing to the farm's operation. There are certain exceptions for `` persons'' who are landowners, family member and sharecroppers, and those are all spelled out in detail. `` In addition to the provisions requiring active engagement in farming, the 1987 act also provides that foreign persons that are not lawfully admitted into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> shall be ineligible to receive any program benefits, including commodity -LRB- price support -RRB- loans, unless that foreign person provides a significant contribution of active personal labor,'' the agency said.

<HEAD>Gulf Production Unlikely To Resume Until After Weekend</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The decreasing likelihood that Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> would seriously disrupt Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> energy production and indications that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> was balking at coming under <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> output restrictions have helped curb the recent oil futures rally. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, wholesale unleaded gasoline for October delivery closed down 1.39 cents at 45.63 cents a gallon on Thursday after rising 3.21 cents in the previous session. The October wholesale heating oil contract fell 1.37 cents a gallon to close at 42.70 cents after a 2.24-cent rise on Wednesday. The October contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, settled 50 cents lower at $ 14.90 per barrel following an 84-cent rise in volatile trading on Wednesday. Crude prices generally had been rising since plunging briefly to two-year lows on Monday. But factors that strengthened the market recently began to fade early in the trading day Thursday along with reports that <PERSON> Hurricane </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> was headed for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> coast, analysts said. Oil and gas companies operating in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> had evacuated many of their personnel from refineries and oil platforms, but observers said the prospect of a major disruption in oil supplies due to the approaching hurricane waned. `` Traders seem to feel that -LRB- Hurricane -RRB- <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> is not going to do a lot of damage now,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION>. Companies reporting the evacuation of oil platforms and refineries along the Gulf indicated they would not restart operations until next week. But analysts said it was unlikely there would be any spot shortages of oil products such as gasoline and heating oil and no effect on contracts scheduled for October delivery. Approximately 870,000 barrels per day of oil and 8 million cubic feet of natural gas are produced at Gulf facilities, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Minerals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Also depressing prices Thursday was a statement from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s oil minister that his country would not lower its oil output if asked to do so by the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> and instead might raise production. The minister's statement punctured the upward momentum that began Monday when <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s King <PERSON> Fahd </PERSON> made a rare public statement calling for cooperation among <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> and non-OPEC oil-producing nations in restraining oil production. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has refused to abide by its OPEC-assigned quota of 1.5 million barrels a day and is reported to be producing about 2.7 million barrels a day. Some observers hoped that after a recent cease-fire in its 8-year-old war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> would join with other <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> nations in setting production limits that would help raise prices. Other <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> nations also are exceeding quotas. The Iraqi statement also dampened hopes that a Sept. 25 meeting of <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s price monitoring committee would produce substantive results.

 Just when many speculators were betting that <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> would retreat from a trans-Atlantic bidding war for <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> publisher counter-attacked in force. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> raised his offer for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> publishing giant to $ 2.41 billion cash on Thursday, in a surprise move to counter a $ 2.36 billion buyout deal that <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> accepted earlier this week from the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, who previously had offered $ 84 for each of the company's 27.76 million shares, said he now was willing to pay $ 86.80 a share He also offered to pay the company's recently declared 20-cent per share quarterly dividend. Alternatively, <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> his Sept. 8 offer to purchase 11 <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> information businesses for $ 1.4 billion still was good. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>'s late afternoon announcement surprised many Wall Street traders, many of whom previously had assumed he probably would back away from <LOCATION> Macmillan </LOCATION> in light of its <LOCATION> Kohlberg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kravis </LOCATION> agreement. Traders scrambled to buy <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> shares in anticipation of a bidding war, pushing the stock up $ 2 a share to $ 86.50 in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite trading. `` I kind of thought it might be over but this really re-ignites the whole situation,'' said <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Boksen </PERSON>, a strategist who follows <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Raymond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, an investment firm in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> `` I'm quite sure <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> does n't want to sell to <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON>'s vice president for investor relations, said the company had no comment on the new <ORGANIZATION> Maxwell </ORGANIZATION> offer. <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> also said through its public relations firm, <ORGANIZATION> Kekst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, that it had no comment. On the surface, <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>'s offer is more attractive to shareholders. The tender offer announced Monday by <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> management and <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION>, would pay shareholders $ 80 in cash and $ 5 in securities and likely would involve selling chunks of the New York-based company. Some analysts speculated <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> management and <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> would be hard pressed to top <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>'s latest bid. But others said <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> managers remain fiercely opposed to selling the company to <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, whom they regard as an unpredictable and capricious businessman who knows little about the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> publishing business. <ORGANIZATION> Harcourt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jovanovich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, another big American publishing concern, successfully thwarted a Maxwell-led takeover last year by loading itself up with billions of dollars in new debt that forced it to sell a number of business. `` <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> is considered a real maverick in this industry, a difficult person to work for or with, and somebody that might pare the company up,'' <PERSON> Boksen </PERSON> said. `` He's not the type of person your more traditional publishing companies want to associate with.'' Some speculated <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> would find a way to raise the offer or perhaps find a third `` white knight'' friendly acquirer for the company. The <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> deal was structured as a leveraged buyout, in which the purchase money is borrowed and repaid with the acquired company's cash flow, earnings or asset sales. It was considered likely that <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> would have to sell part of its operations to finance such a deal. <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> is a leading publisher of educational textbooks. It also owns a range of other information businesses that range from telemarketing services to the <ORGANIZATION> Berlitz </ORGANIZATION> language training school chain.

 Chevrolet has announced two new car lines, including a new line of four imports designed to give the auto giant a larger share of the small car market. Chevrolet executives, on hand here to preview the new lines for dealers on Thursday, said the new imports and a new mid-size domestic series would boost its standing against cars made by rival <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. One of the new lines, the Geo, will have four models and will be offered only through Chevrolet dealers Company officials said 80 percent of their 5,000 dealers had agreed to handle the line, using separate signs and display areas. The second line, the <PERSON> Lumina </PERSON>, will replace the Celebrity series. <ORGANIZATION> Chevrolet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> Division General Manager <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burger </PERSON> said the Geo was created `` to significantly broaden our customer appeal and to attract buyers who currently may not consider buying a Chevrolet.'' <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Erdman </PERSON>, general marketing manager for <ORGANIZATION> Chevrolet </ORGANIZATION>, a division of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said 40 percent of car sales are small cars, a market dominated by imports. <PERSON> Erdman </PERSON> said surveys indicate 28 percent of the people who buy imports never have been in a domestic manufacturer's dealership. Promotion of the Geo will mark the `` most aggressive special marketing effort ever undertaken at <LOCATION> Chevrolet </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Erdman </PERSON> said. `` There are 400 nameplates out there,'' he said of the growing auto market. `` Competing for a share of the market is a real challenge.'' Asked about the cost of the imports, considering the current yen rate, <PERSON> Erdman </PERSON> admitted `` it's going to be a very difficult challenge to make money on them.'' The yen has risen sharply against the dollar since 1985, making Japanese products more expensive in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaafsma </PERSON>, chief engineer for <ORGANIZATION> Chevrolet </ORGANIZATION> division, said the American auto manufacturer is `` actively working with all three of our affiliates to get costs down.'' <PERSON> Erdman </PERSON> said he expected the <LOCATION> Lumina </LOCATION> line to account for 17 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Chevrolet </ORGANIZATION>'s sales by 1991. <PERSON> Lumina </PERSON> will replace all Celebrity models except the station wagon by the 1990 model year. The 1990 model of a Lumina sedan will be introduced next spring. <PERSON> Burger </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Chevrolet </ORGANIZATION> expects to sell more than 3 million cars and trucks in the 1989 model year, provided the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy continues to support a forecast of 15 million car and truck sales next year. Chevrolet officials attending a news conference to unveil the new products vowed the automotive giant would top sales of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> cars next year. In the 1988 model year, which began Oct. 1, 1987, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> has sold 1,450,010 cars from its Ford Division through Sept. 10, up 7 percent from the same period in the 1987 model year. Chevrolet has sold 1,401,190 cars in the current model year, 3 percent fewer than during the same period in the 1987 model year. The Geo line will include the Prizm, <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> and Spectrum cars and the Tracker utility vehicle. <PERSON> Chevrolet </PERSON> said <PERSON> Geo </PERSON> car prices will range from $ 5,999 for the <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION>, which is advertised at getting 53 mpg, to $ 7,610 for the Spectrum, now made in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Isuzu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd </ORGANIZATION>. The base price for the Tracker will be $ 10,195. Distribution of the Tracker will be limited to a dozen states on the East and West coasts. The Tracker and <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> will be made by <ORGANIZATION> Suzuki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the Prizm will be made in <LOCATION> Fremont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, by <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a joint venture of <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION>

<HEAD>Grand Jury Indicts Ashland Oil In Fuel Spill</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> officials have reacted bitterly to criminal charges lodged against the company for a massive oil spill, saying the charges will impair efforts to comply with environmental laws. `` The company is disappointed that criminal actions will be pursued in light of <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts to mitigate the spill's impact and the fact that the company quickly accepted responsibility for the incident,'' <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Schrum </PERSON> said Thursday On Thursday, a federal grand jury indicted <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> for violations of the federal Clean Water and the Refuse acts, the first criminal charges arising from the Jan. 2 spill that contaminated drinking water in three states. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said the two misdemeanor counts were the most stringent that could be brought because federal environmental laws do not contain felony provisions for corporations for such offenses. `` We're doing the best we can,'' he said. `` We're following the evidence based on the law that exists here.'' Conviction carries a maximum penalty of a $ 200,000 fine on each count or double the monetary loss suffered as a result of the criminal conduct. So far, the losses amount to more than $ 10 million, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Schrum </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> voluntarily has paid more than $ 11.4 million for clean-up costs and to reimburse claims from individuals, businesses and government agencies. The decision to prosecute <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> goes against past practices by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to pursue criminal violations only in instances of deliberate acts, he said. `` We think such actions impair rather than promote environmental compliance,'' <PERSON> Schrum </PERSON> said. The spill occurred when an <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> riverside storage tank at the company's Floreffe terminal in <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, collapsed while being filled with 3.8 million gallons of fuel oil. About 1 million gallons escaped the containment dikes at the facility, and more than 700,000 gallons spilled into the <LOCATION> Monongahela </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and traveled downstream, well beyond the river's confluence with the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> The government said the accident represented one of the largest inland oil spills in the nation's history, affecting drinking water supplies and plant and animal life in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. About 23,000 suburban <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> residents went without tap water for almost a week. The indictment said <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> had disassembled a 48-year-old oil storage tank near <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> in 1986 and then reassembled it at the <LOCATION> Floreffe </LOCATION> terminal. It was placed in service in August 1987. In May, investigators for an independent research institute that studied the accident said a dime-size flaw in the tank's brittle steel walls caused the collapse. Aggravating the condition were the relative weakness of the World War II-era steel, pressure from the diesel fuel and cold weather, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Battelle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. Besides failing to obtain all necessary local permits for erecting the tank, <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> said it failed to fill the tank with water before use, a test recommended by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, an industry group. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said the indictment does not end the federal government's investigation of the oil spill. He said the government still must determine if any <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> employees or officials violated the law. The state attorney general's office also is conducting a criminal investigation but has brought no charges. In a separate civil action in July, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> filed a proposed consent decree requiring <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Ashland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, to complete the clean-up of the spill and to reimburse the government $ 680,000 for emergency response work by federal agencies. <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to the decree's terms.

<HEAD>NRC Set To Act On Final Obstacles For Seabrook Plant</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has set the stage for two key votes that could remove the final regulatory obstacles in the <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, plant's long road toward a low-power operating license. If the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> acts today in favor of the plant, <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> could be eligible for the license within 30 days, but <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> officials have vowed to fight the license in federal court. The low-power license has been a key pressure point in the struggle between <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> owners, the nuclear industry and <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> state officials on one side and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, local officials and anti-nuclear activists on the other. <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> must obtain the license, which would allow it to test the reactor at 5 percent of capacity, before securing a full-power commercial operating license. The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> is to decide two issues. The first is whether to allow a reactor to operate at low power without having an emergency system in place to alert neighbors in case of a plant accident. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> municipalities in the 10-mile zone forced <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> officials to remove the sirens. Under the new rule, the siren system would have to be in place only for full-power license consideration. <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> officials are working on plans to mount sirens on trucks and helicopters. The second issue, which was tentatively scheduled for an <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> vote, was a petition by opponents urging the commission to break from its regulations and consider the financial condition of the plant's owners. The lead owner, <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION>, filed for bankruptcy protection in January. <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> owns 36 percent of the plant. In June, <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wholesale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which is the fourth largest <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> shareholder at 12 percent, announced it was withdrawing from the project and would stop making its $ 2 million-a-month payments. For opponents, blocking the low-power license is critical because they say 5 percent power tests would contaminate the facility with radioactive fuel, ruling out a future conversion to a gas-fired plant or other facility advocated by nuclear critics. Plant officials say the tests would not rule out a conversion. <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> opponents believe plant owners and the commission are trying to win low-power license approval before the possibility of encountering a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> presidency that could further hinder the licensing process. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the Democratic presidential nominee, says it would be impossible to quickly evacuate residents from the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> seacoast towns that lie within the plant's 10-mile emergency evacuation zone, an area that swells with summer tourists and has congested roads on normal days. The idle $ 5.6 billion reactor is losing $ 50 million each month in maintenance and finance costs. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> said last week that if the two regulatory obstacles were removed by the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>, the state would fight the license in federal appeals court.

<HEAD>HCA Buyout Proposal Hinted By Management</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A management group may make a $ 3.3 billion bid to buy <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, one of the world's largest hospital chains, and it is trying to line up financing for the bid But financial analysts were divided over whether <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION> was worth the $ 47-a-share offer the group, which includes the company's chairman, might put on the table `` I have no reason to believe that there is a second would-be buyer out there, but if someone had asked me where it would go, I would have said between $ 50 and $ 55,'' <PERSON> Margo </PERSON> <PERSON> Durow </PERSON>, an analyst with a <ORGANIZATION> J.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bradford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday. <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughey </PERSON> <PERSON> Smyth </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> Equitable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said the offer was reasonable and that the time was right for <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION> to move into private hands. `` There are no compelling reasons for hospital companies to have access to public markets any more,'' she said. `` They are not in a growth pattern any more.'' Wall Street also mulled over the propsal. In heavy trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION> had soared to $ 47.50 a share Thursday before closing at $ 43.75, up $ 6.62 -LCB-. <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION>, which owns or operates nearly 400 hospitals worldwide, said on Thursday that the group of managers, including Chairman <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frist </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, had advised the board of directors about the intended proposal of $ 47 a share in cash for <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION>'s 70.6 million shares outstanding. An <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION> statement said <PERSON> Frist </PERSON> planned to negotiate with unidentified third parties to obtain financing for a leveraged buyout, in which a company is acquired largely with borrowed money repaid from the target company's profits or asset sales. The <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> newspaper, the Tennessean, quoted unnamed sources as saying the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment banking firm <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> was expected to arrange the financing. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> also handled the sale of high-interest `` junk'' bonds in <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 1.64 billion sale of 104 of its hospitals to <ORGANIZATION> HealthTrust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> last year. <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION> said its board had established a special committee to review any management proposal for an acquisition and had received no guarantee that one would be `` We believe in today's environment, <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION>, as a private company, could better serve all of its constituents including patients, employees, physicians, and our various communities including and especially <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Frist </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Frist </PERSON> was the only member of management identified in the attempt. <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION> currently owns 79 medical, surgical hospitals and 51 psychiatric hospitals. It also manages 225 other hospitals and owns or manages 42 international hospitals. The company reported in July that its profits for the quarter ending June 30 increased by 15 percent, partly because of increased inpatient and outpatient revenues. For the second quarter, after-tax profit totaled about $ 70.8 million, or $ 1 a share, on revenue of $ 1.02 billion. For the same period a year earlier, earnings were $ 61.3 million, or 74 cents a share, on revenue of about $ 1.3 billion.

<DATELINE>GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has rejected the second takeover offer this year, saying his company wants to remain independent. On Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION> turned down a buyout proposal from an investor group led by <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBow </PERSON>, who said he still wants to buy <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION>' tobacco companies. `` The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION> board of directors continues to believe that the best long-term interest of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION> and its shareholders is that the company continue to operate as an independent company,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. Alley. `` <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION> has no interest in engaging in discussions with Mr. <PERSON> LeBow </PERSON> with respect to an acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION> said on Thursday that <ORGANIZATION> Brooke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> L.P. </ORGANIZATION>, which is controlled by <PERSON> LeBow </PERSON>, had filed for federal antitrust clearance to acquire more than $ 15 million worth of the company's stock, and might acquire more than 50 percent of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION>' outstanding American Brands closed at $ 48.37 -LCB- a share Thursday, down 37 -LCB- cents in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading. Based on Thursday's closing price and the company's roughly 110 million common shares outstanding, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION> has a market value of about $ 5.32 billion It was the second takeover overture this year for <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION>, which in February acquired <ORGANIZATION> E-II </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 1.1 billion after <ORGANIZATION> E-II </ORGANIZATION> launched an attempted hostile buyout of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> LeBow </PERSON> had approached the company in July about a possible acquisition of its <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which <PERSON> LeBow </PERSON> also controls. American Tobacco brands include Lucky Strike and <LOCATION> Tareyton </LOCATION> cigarettes and <ORGANIZATION> Half </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Half pipe tobacco, among others. Americans Brands officials rejected <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION>'s proposed deal saying it was not in the company's best interests. In a letter to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION>'s chairman, <PERSON> LeBow </PERSON> said he continued to believe the `` economic logic of combining <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> and the tobacco operations of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION> compels us to effect such a combination.'' <PERSON> LeBow </PERSON> said in the letter that <PERSON> Brooke </PERSON> continued to be interested in acquiring the Greenwich-based firm's tobacco business rather than the entire company. <PERSON> Alley </PERSON> noted that <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION> was pursuing a restructuring program aimed at sharpening the company's focus and increasing shareholder value. In the past 16 months, <PERSON> Alley </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION> has invested $ 2 billion to acquire seven businesses designed to `` strengthen'' the company's `` core business strategy.'' The company has also divested itself of businesses that do not meet its goals and has purchased 17.1 million million shares of its common stock, <PERSON> Alley </PERSON> said.

 Government officials vowed Friday that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> will not open its market to foreign rice imports, and expressed hopes the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will reject a petition from <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> rice farmers seeking to sell in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` Rice should be a serious concern to all Japanese,'' <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Eiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakao </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> meeting Friday. `` Every Cabinet member should take this matter seriously and protect domestic rice production.'' <PERSON> Nakao </PERSON>'s remarks were quoted in a statement from the agency. The agriculture minister and other officials expressed regret at a complaint filed with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative's office Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Millers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The organization, which represents 11,000 American rice growers, demanded that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> allow foreigners to provide 10 percent of its annual rice consumption of 10 million tons within four years. The petition was based on a section of the recently passed omnibus trade law, which requires the president to retaliate against a country deemed protectionist by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The Trade Representative's office has 45 days to decide whether to accept the petition before it starts investigations. `` The two governments have agreed not to negotiate this matter on a bilateral basis,'' Agricultural Minister <PERSON> Takashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sato </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` We regret such a complaint was filed in spite of the agreement.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Rice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Millers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> filed a similar complaint in 1986, but it was turned down. <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> has sought arbitration at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, an international body that governs world trade. Self-sufficiency in rice production is a sensitive issue in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, where rice remains the staple food. Rice growers comprise nearly 80 percent of all Japanese farmers.

 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s annual rate of inflation rose to 5.7 percent in August, the highest level in three years, the government announced Friday. Nevertheless, the increase from 4.8 percent in July was not as bad as some investors and economists had feared. Stocks showed little reaction. Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> warned on Wednesday that there would be a significant increase in the rate because of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s practice of including mortgage rates in the calculation. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s mortgage rates have climbed sharply, and are in 13-percent range, following the government's move in recent months to push interest rates up to curb inflation by dampening the country's strong consumer spending. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s annual inflation rate has climbed substantially so far this year and is much higher than had been forecast. The rate stood at 3.3 percent in January.

 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is recalling about 30,500 cars, trucks, vans and school buses to conduct safety-related inspections and replace parts that could be defective. The company said Thursday that about 8,000 1988 Buick Regals are being recalled for inspection and possible replacement of a brake hose that could wear through and result in a reduction of braking capability. About 21,000 1985 and 1986 Chevrolet and GMC P-30 trucks and G-30 vans also are being recalled to repair a control arm in the front suspension. The arm could crack, resulting in a loss of steering control, the company said. In addition, 1,500 1987 and 1988 model Chevrolet and GMC school buses, all equipped with gasoline engines, are being recalled because of possible problems in the location of air brake lines. The lines may have been put too close to exhaust systems, causing wearing and a partial or complete loss of brakes, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> said.

 Three <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> shareholders have sued to block the company's proposed $ 3.8 billion restructuring aimed at fending off hostile takeovers of the nation's largest supermarket chain. In two class action lawsuits filed Thursday, the shareholders asked the <ORGANIZATION> Hamilton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Common </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pleas </ORGANIZATION> to prevent <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> from adopting the plan. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> announced the plan Tuesday after the Maryland-based <PERSON> Haft </PERSON> family, known for its takeover forays, had received government clearance to buy at least $ 15 million worth of <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> stock. The lawsuits charge that <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> executives and directors are trying to protect their own financial interests, not the interests of shareholders, with the proposed restructuring. `` By proposing the restructuring plan, they have displayed their predisposition and determination to reject and thwart tender and or other offers and proposals by third parties for enhanced shareholder value, so as to preserve and protect their emoluments and positions with the company,'' one suit contends. The suits, both filed as class actions on behalf of all 52,000 <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> shareholders, seek unspecified damages. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> declined comment on the suits.

 <ORGANIZATION> Ames </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> will jump from fifth place to third among the nation's largest discount retailers with its acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Zayre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s 388 discount stores, <PERSON> Ames </PERSON>' president said `` We will also gain entry into new and profitable markets, such as <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, as well as increase our penetration in other markets,'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollis </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Ames </ORGANIZATION>' president and chief executive officer, said Thursday. The deal announced Thursday was valued at about $ 800 million, company officials said. Ames currently operates 348 discount stores, primarily in small towns in 18 states in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> region. With the deal, <ORGANIZATION> Ames </ORGANIZATION> will have its first stores in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, as well as <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lousiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ames </PERSON>' director of investor relations. Zayre discount stores are similar to Ames stores, although some are located in larger metropolitan areas in 26 states, <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said. The two chains have 12 stores that compete in the same communities, <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said. Ames' marketing strategy has been to locate in small towns, and operate as old-fashioned general stores. About 45 percent of its inventory is apparel and domestic items such as sheets, pillow cases and rugs. The remaining 55 percent is hard line, hardware, houseware, jewelry, health and beauty aids and automobile parts. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said no decision had been made on the possible closing of some stores or possible layoffs. `` One of the first things we will do is study all Zayre locations for their long-term profit potential,'' she said. Ames Chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON> said the company had been analyzing the Zayre discount business for several months. `` The transaction has been extensively studied from every point of view. We believe it is a unique opportunity under most favorable terms,'' he said. In the fiscal year ended Jan. 30, <ORGANIZATION> Ames </ORGANIZATION> had revenue of $ 2.1 billion and net income of $ 34.2 million. In addition to its discount stores, <ORGANIZATION> Ames </ORGANIZATION> operates 161 smaller variety stores under the G.C. <ORGANIZATION> Murphy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Variety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> name. <LOCATION> Framingham </LOCATION>, Mass.-based Zayre Stores, currently the nation's fourth largest discount retailer, had annual sales of $ 3.5 billion last year and a profit of $ 143.3 million It's discount stores, however, were n't profitable, posting losses last year. Zayre's other businesses include <PERSON> TJ </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxx </PERSON>, Hit or Miss and <ORGANIZATION> Miss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chadwicks </ORGANIZATION> of <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ames </PERSON> said Zayre will receive cash, $ 200 million in subordinated notes and preferred stock convertible to 8 million shares of <ORGANIZATION> Ames </ORGANIZATION> common stock at a price of $ 25 a share Zayre will own a 17.5 percent share of <LOCATION> Ames </LOCATION> stock when the deal is completed, <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said. But a 10-year agreement was put into effect that limits Zayre to owning a maximum of 20 percent of the voting securities of <LOCATION> Ames </LOCATION>. Zayre said in a statement that its estimated net cash proceeds would be $ 620 million after expenses and refinancing of the subordinate note. The company said that after paying about $ 250 million in short-term debt it plans to use `` a substantial portion of the balance'' to benefit shareholders, possibly through a major stock buyback. Zayre also said it will incur a one-time charge in the third quarter of about $ 110 million because of the discontinued operations. `` We are pleased to be able to enhance the value of our shares through the redeployment of our assets as evidenced by this transaction,'' Zayre Chairman <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Segall </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ames </PERSON> said Zayre will have the right to nominate two directors. The boards of both companies have approved the deal, which is still subject to regulatory approval and completion of Ames' financing <PERSON> Ames </PERSON> said it has a commitment from <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> N.A </ORGANIZATION>. The transaction was expected to be completed in 45 days.

The official, who was not identified, was quoted by the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION>. There was no elaboration on the type of shoddy goods shipped or which foreign trading partner had the best record. The report said 26.25 percent of British commodities, 24.73 percent of French products and 22 percent of goods from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Macao </LOCATION> failed to meet contract standards. In total, the administration inspected 56,695 shipments of imported goods in the first half of the year, and found quality products in 15.7 percent.

 Business inventories rose only a modest 0.3 percent in July even though sales were down by 0.2 percent, the government said today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said inventories held on shelves and backlots rose $ 2.2 billion to a seasonally adjusted $ 733.7 billion, while sales edged down by $ 1.2 billion. The July gain in inventories followed a 0.8 percent rise in June and was the 19th consecutive month without a decline. However, the July increase was the smallest since a 0.2 percent rise in August 1987. Economists sometimes take rising inventories as a sign of economic weakness. Too many goods in reserve could lead to production cuts and layoffs at manufacturing plants. However, analysts have not been worried over the past year because the inventory gain has simply been keeping up with strong sales. The July drop in sales was the first since November and followed a strong jump of 1.4 percent in June. The June inventory accumulation was led by 0.5 percent increases at both the manufacturing and wholesale levels. Inventories shrank by 0.1 percent at the retail level, where sales have been weakest in recent months. In sales, a 0.9 percent decline at factories more than offset a 0.6 percent rise at the wholesale level and a slight 0.1 percent increase at retail stores. An advance estimate of retail sales for August, released Thursday, showed a 0.2 percent decrease. The combination of weak sales and slowly rising inventories left the inventory-to-sales ratio unchanged at 1.5 in July. That means it would take 1.5 months to exhaust inventories at the July sales pace, a ratio not considered abnormally high.

 The government disclosed new evidence of a weakening economy today, reporting a rise in business inventories last month that coincided with a decline in sales. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said business inventories rose 0.3 percent in July while sales fell 0.2 percent. The July increase in inventories was the 19th straight month without a decline. The drop in sales was the first since January and followed a strong jump of 1.4 percent in June. Economists sometimes interpret rising inventories and slowing sales as a signal of economic weakness. Too many goods in reserve could lead to production cuts and layoffs at manufacturing plants. The report came a day after the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said sales of retail merchandise, a narrower category of sales, fell 0.2 percent in August, and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry's operating rate was unchanged in August, the first time in six months the figure has n't increased These figures also suggested that the economy is beginning to weaken after a period of strong growth, thereby easing some fears of inflation that have dogged the nation's financial markets for months. The Federal Reserve, in an effort to slow the economy by curbing domestic demand, has been pushing interest rates higher since late March and economists say the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> tightening may be beginning to take hold. `` I think things are looking just fine inflation-wise,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Evans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> consulting firm. `` I think the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> deserves an A. I think they tightened just enough to slow down the economy without sending it into a tailspin.'' Financial markets today showed little reaction to the economic news, however. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks had moved less than a point higher by late morning. In the bond market, prices were little changed, and the dollar held steady against foreign currencies.

 Grain and soybean futures opened lower today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in a continuation of the technically based sell-off that began late in Thursday's session, analysts said. Prices dropped sharply in the closing minutes Thursday after wheat traders pushed prices for December and March delivery to new contract highs. December wheat peaked at $ 4.32 \ a bushel and March wheat hit $ 4.36 a bushel Having made new those highs, wheat prices are likely to fall 15 to 20 cents a bushel to levels near recent lows, said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Zusel </PERSON>, manager of floor operations at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Balfour </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maclaine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` I think we're just in a big trading range right now,'' he said. `` We've been at the higher end of the range and now we're going toward the lower end of range. Other crop futures have tended to follow the wheat market in recent weeks. <PERSON> Zusel </PERSON> said good prospects for rain this weekend in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> may spark some buying of corn and soybean futures on ideas that showers will slow the harvest of those crops. But he said harvesting was barely underway so a delay at this point probably would n't have much impact on prices. In early trading, wheat was 3 cents to 4 \ cents lower with the contract for delivery in December at $ 4.19 a bushel; corn was 2 \ cents lower to 1 cent higher with September at $ 2.80 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 3 -LCB- cents to 5 -LCB- cents lower with December at $ 2.70 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 3 cents to 8 -LCB- cents lower with September at $ 8.65 a Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in position-evening ahead of this afternoon's seven-state cattle-on-feed report from the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Court Again Blocks Partial Merger</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal appeals court has ordered The <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> to delay their partial merger, which could have begun as early as this weekend, as the judges consider whether the deal should be scrapped altogether. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> late Thursday ordered a stay in an order by Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> allowing the newspapers to merge their business, production and circulation department's under an exception to federal antitrust laws. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Citizens for an <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, an organization of advertisers and readers opposed to the newspapers' joint operating agreement, had asked for the extension in a motion filed earlier in the day. The court ordered the delay to gain time to study the complex case, the court clerk's office said. The group last month successfully blocked the immediate merger of the newspapers' business and production departments in a challenge to a decision by then-Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> allowing the joint operating agreement under the Newspaper Preservation Act. The temporary stay granted by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> forced the newspapers to recall laid-off employees and quickly alter printing plans. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Revercomb </PERSON> on Wednesday rejected the challenge and said he would allow the order staying the partial merger to expire at 7:15 p.m. on Saturday. The appeals court's order Thursday means the combination will not proceed on that schedule. The newspapers had not said how quickly then could have begun joint production under the agreement after expiration of the earlier stay. Free Press Publisher <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> this week said the newspapers would begin the operation as soon as they were legally cleared to do so. The court issued its own order staying <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s decision rather than granting the opponents' request for a stay, thereby gaining time to study the case without seeming to accept the contentions of either side. After the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Citizens group made its request, Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON> filed an eight-page brief with the appeals court opposing any stay of the agreement. The opponents of the merger `` have fallen far short of their burden of showing that the attorney general acted so mistakenly that his decision can be labeled irrational,'' said <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON>'s brief. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON>, an attorney for <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Citizens, said after the appeal was filed that his clients could show a stay was appropriate because a lower court judge, in granting the earlier stay, had agreed that allowing the merger to proceed prior to a court ruling would produce `` irreparable injury'' and be contrary to the public interest. Opponents of the agreement argued that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> had ignored findings that the Free Press was not a failing newspaper and that financial losses by it and the News were caused by management decisions rather than being inherent to the marketplace. <PERSON> Revercomb </PERSON> rejected that contention, saying that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> had reasonably found that the Free Press would have already failed were it not owned by a large corporate parent, <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> had no comment on the appeal, said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlatter </PERSON>, manager of corporate communications <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> also declined comment. `` We're simply waiting to see what the appeals court does,'' said <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, public affairs manager. The News referred inquires to <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION>. The general manager of the Free Press, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, said today, `` The stay that was issued is really an administrative stay, and it's only issued for the convenience of the court to take some time to look at the request for the stay,'' The delay `` just gives the judges a couple of days to look at the filings'' and has no bearing on the merits of the case. The merger of the newspapers' business, advertising, circulation and production departments would result in layoffs of 600 to 800 employees. The Free Press had a daily circulation last year of 638,720, compared with the News' 678,720, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Audit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circulation </ORGANIZATION>. On Sundays, the News held a slightly larger lead, 839,319 to 724,342.

<TEXT>
 Considering what they have to put up with, you could hardly blame Americans if they got down on themselves and their economy, since it is full of gaps and crunches. Week after week they are reminded of wage crunches, tax crunches, savings crunches, interest rate crunches and home mortgage crunches. According to a popular magazine, the ranks of middle management also are being crunched. It is an economy that critics say is filled with gaps. Most glaring, of course, are the trade gap and the budget gap, but there are also age gaps in corporations and a widening gap between stock and bond yields. Whenever the economy seems to gather strength it is whacked back by its custodians with talk of higher taxes or interest rates, or with warnings of bad things to come. Sometimes they act, too, as when the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> raises interest rates. Is n't a strong economy what everyone wants? Of course, but not too strong, says the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>, because that might bring inflation, a position that recently provoked economist <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruff </PERSON> into wishing he were in another business. Said <PERSON> Ruff </PERSON>: `` If I were a political cartoonist, I would depict -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> Chairman Alan -RRB- <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> giving a smiling patient, the economy, a small shot of arsenic while explaining, ` You're too healthy for your own good.''' Seldom is optimism offered by those sages who claim to see the future. And even when it is, it comes wrapped in dull brown paper and contains a warning that the contents should be considered dangerous. Think about this from an economist-educator: `` Although the outlook for the economy continues to erode, and there has been a clear upward shift ... to raise prices, there is no sign that we are poised to enter a recession.'' Considering all this, it speaks for the resiliency of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consumer that confidence snapped back in August after having been depressed in June and July. That news comes from the <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit organization that regularly measures attitudes of thousands of households throughout the country, the goal being to ascertain their buying intentions. The latest survey revealed that a rising number of Americans in August were more optimistic about current and future business conditions than they had been in the previous two months. A greater percentage said that the economy would improve and that jobs would become more plentiful over the next six months. The farm mood was found to be improving. And households in general were impressed by the economy's vigor. The professional watchers of the economy, however, will not be impressed by such things. Instead, they will view this more confident mood as a danger to be watched, lest it explode into an inflationary buying boom. There is little new in such interpretations; the negative theme has been `` in'' for more than a year among those who think they understand how modern economies work. But what the `` experts'' sometimes may tend to overlook is the endurance, economic understanding and sense of responsibility of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consumer. Could it be that those qualities have something to do with the fact that the seers' worst fears failed to occur over the past year?

<HEAD>Dollar Stuck in Tight Range in Europe, Gold Falls Sharply</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar finished mixed Friday after remaining in a tight range during the European session, reflecting indecision among market participants about the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency's direction. Gold prices tumbled as much as $ 6.50 an ounce in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, hurt by what bullion brokers called investor disappointment with the precious metal's declining value over the last few weeks. Traders said the dollar spent the day in a range of about 1.8700 West German marks to 1.8780 marks, roughly the same range it was confined to Thursday. One trader said the market `` just does n't have an idea which way to push it. Traders said fear of central bank intervention combined with internal market resistance is preventing the dollar from rising, but that the recent news of an improvement in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit is supporting the currency. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost $ 1.6758 to buy one pound, vs. $ 1.6675 late Thursday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> compared with late Thursday included: 1.8763 West German marks, down from 1.8775; 1.5835 Swiss francs, up from 1.5820; 6.3795 French francs, up from 6.3790; 2.1151 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1160; 1,398.50 Italian lire, down from 1,398.87; 1.2232 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2225. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where the business day ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s begins, the dollar rose 0.31 yen to a closing 133.76 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 134.25 yen. Gold fell in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to $ 412 a troy ounce, compared with $ 417.75 late Thursday. Brokers said that because of the metal's failure to stay above the psychologically important level of $ 420, many gold holders were selling. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, gold closed $ 411 compared with $ 417.50 late Thursday. Earlier in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold fell $ 3.61 to close at $ 419.84. Silver bullion prices fell on the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> market $ 6.40 a troy ounce, compared with $ 6.44 Thursday.

 The stock market advanced slightly today in activity swollen by the so-called triple witching hour. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 3.03 to 2,095.31 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street. Gainers slightly outnumbered losers in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 695 up, 625 down and 549 unchanged. The session began with an outburst of activity by professional traders closing out positions linked to expiring stock index futures and options. Some of those September contracts were settled as of the opening, and others were due to be settled at the close. In the last month of each calendar quarter, the simultaneous expiration of a set of index options, index futures and options on individual stocks has become a familiar phenomenon, dubbed the `` triple witching hour.'' Otherwise, analysts said the market was still drifting without direction. The economy has obliged Wall Street lately by showing signs of growing at a slower, and presumably more sustainable, pace, but the markets' response has n't been as enthusiastic as many observers expected.

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Plunge; Grains Close Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soybean futures prices plunged in late trading Friday to close sharply lower on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> as sellers chased buyers and found none. Grain futures also closed lower. `` The market theoretically probes for the orders,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Freed </PERSON>, grain analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` In general we ran out of bullish news this week and when the market started looking for consumption buying and speculative buying, all it found was sell stops.'' Sell stops are price levels that trigger large numbers of sell orders. Massive selling of contracts for November delivery of soybeans occurred at $ 8.71 a bushel and $ 8.66 a bushel, Freed said. The November soybean contract closed at $ 8.58 a bushel, more than 27 cents below Thursday's final price. The declines in corn and wheat prices were not as sharp. Wheat was supported by indications that new export business was developing, Freed said, and corn futures drew some support from the wheat market. At the close, wheat was 2 -LCB- cents to 7 cents lower with the contract for delivery in September at $ 4.02 a bushel; corn was -LCB- cent to 5 -LCB- cents lower with September at $ 2.79 a bushel; oats were 4 -RCB- cents to 9 cents lower with September at $ 2.60 \ a bushel; soybeans were 16 cents to 27 -LCB- cents lower with September at $ 8.47 a bushel

 <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, target of a $ 2.6 billion hostile takeover bid by <ORGANIZATION> Cardinal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acquisition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said Friday it was talking with commercial banks about a possible recapitalization of the company.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> pilots, locked in a battle with management, told financial analysts Friday the ailing airline may have to be sold or merged with sister carrier <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. `` Anywhere you look you can see the systematic destruction of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Vician </PERSON>, vice chairman of the Master Executive Council of the Eastern pilots' union. `` This airline can not be turned around by labor concessions alone.'' <PERSON> Vician </PERSON> said the union sees three possible options at this point: negotiation of an acceptable contract agreement between the pilots and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> management, a merger between <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> or a buyout of Eastern by an outside entity. Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, a non-union carrier, are both subsidiaries of giant <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Eastern continues to sustain heavy losses, posting a net loss of $ 89.8 million in the second quarter Eastern employees have accused <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> of siphoning off cash, in the form of management fees, rents on planes and airport gates and commissions on fuel purchases, from <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> into its parent company, The pilots union and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> management are scheduled to meet in contract negotiations by the end of the month. While <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> continues to seek cuts in labor costs, it has indicated it could seek to freeze the pilots' wages and cut costs through attrition and longer flying hours. The pilots may try to build `` fence agreements'' into the contract, such as one allowing them to unionize <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> pilots, according to union sources. The airline laid off 4,000 employees early this month. A federal judge in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> had ruled Eastern could not lay off unionized personnel. But the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> later dissolved the order, saying the carrier would have to post a $ 4.7 million bond to cover a month of paychecks should the unions win their case. Members of the Machinists union at Eastern began voting Friday on a contract that would cut pay for mechanics by as much as 20 percent, with even sharper cuts for less-skilled workers. It is unusual for a union to advocate a merger. But <PERSON> Vician </PERSON> and <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> <PERSON> Kupersmith </PERSON>, an accountant at <ORGANIZATION> Touche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> who is working with the pilots, told the analysts a merger between <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> would remove the contentious issue of cash transfers out of Eastern. `` There is no good merger in the -LRB- airline -RRB- industry with responsibility to the employees,'' <PERSON> Vician </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> after the meeting. `` It would not be our first choice.'' As for another possible approach, a takeover of Eastern by the pilots with outside financial backing, <PERSON> Vician </PERSON> said his union has been advised that `` that is a futile effort.''

 The stock market gained ground Friday, riding out the so-called triple witching hour involving a set of expiring futures and options on stock indexes. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 5.87 to 2,098.15, finishing the week with a net gain of 29.34 points.

Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 211.11 million shares, up from 161.21 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 238.33 million shares. The session began and ended with outbursts of activity by professional traders closing out positions linked to expiring stock index futures and options. Some of those September contracts were settled as of the opening, and others at the close. In the last month of each calendar quarter, the simultaneous expiration of a set of index options, index futures and options on individual stocks has become a familiar phenomenon, dubbed the `` triple witching hour.''

<HEAD>Gold Futures Plunge To 1{-Year Low</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Gold futures prices, undermined by slack investor demand due to the improved economic scenario, plunged to their lowest level in 1 -LCB- years Friday on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. On other markets, prices for future delivery of silver, sugar, cotton, oil, soybeans, grains and cattle all declined. Pork futures gained and stock-index futures retreated. Gold for October delivery traded as low as $ 410 a troy ounce Friday, the lowest price for near-month delivery since March 23, 1987, when the April contract dropped to $ 406.90. October gold settled Friday at $ 412.90, $ 6.90 below Thursday's final price Gold prices have been falling gradually all year, although they stabilized during the summer in response to the inflationary implications of the drought-driven rise in grain prices. Gold began the year at about $ 480 a troy ounce. `` The price has been going down and it's still going down but it's picking up some steam,'' said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Sloane </PERSON>, precious metals analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The main negative factor in the gold market is the improved inflation outlook, analysts said. Gold historically holds its value during times of rising prices, so demand for the metal typically rises with prospects for higher inflation. Recent credit-tightening moves by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> have slowed the growth of the economy and relieved inflationary pressures. <PERSON> Sloane </PERSON> said gold prices probably would fall again on Monday based on chart analysis that predicts the next point of firm support at $ 390 a troy ounce. Silver futures also finished sharply lower, dropping rapidly in the closing minutes of the session. Silver settled 14.1 cents to 15.2 cents lower with September at $ 6.326 a troy ounce. Sugar futures skidded to a sharply lower finish on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on technical factors in the absence of fundamental supply-and-demand factors, said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Sugar settled .50 cent to .67 cent lower with October at 10.06 cents a Cotton futures fell the 2-cents-a-pound permitted limit for the second straight day on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as fears of damage to cotton crops from Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> continued to fade, analysts said. Cotton settled 1.65 cents to 2 cents lower with October at 52.90 cents a pound. Energy futures also posted steep losses on the diminishing prospects that <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> would seriously disrupt oil refinery operations on the Texas-Louisiana coast, analysts said. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 32 cents to 33 cents lower with October at $ 14.57 a barrel; heating oil was 1.33 cents to 1.49 cents lower with October at 41.37 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 1.28 cents to 1.72 cents lower with October at 44.22 cents a gallon. Soybean futures prices plunged in late trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> as sellers chased buyers and found none. Grain futures also finished lower. `` In general we ran out of bullish news this week and when the market started looking for consumption buying and speculative buying, all it found was sell stops,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Freed </PERSON>, grain analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Sell stops are price levels that trigger large numbers of sell orders. Wheat settled 4 cents to 6 -LCB- cents lower with September at $ 4.03 a bushel; corn was \ cent to 5 cents lower with September at $ 2.78 -RCB- a bushel; oats were 7 cents to 9 \ cents lower with September at $ 2.58 a bushel; soybeans were 16 -LCB- cents to 26 cents lower with September at $ 8.47 -LCB- a bushel Pork futures gained on technical factors on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> while cattle futures finished mostly lower on position-evening ahead of the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s monthly seven-state cattle-on-feed report. The report, issued after the close, said the number of cattle being fed for slaughter as of Sept. 1 in the seven major beef states was down 2 percent from a year ago. Placement of new cattle and calves in fattening pens last month was down 16 percent from a year ago while marketings of `` fed'' cattle were unchanged. Most analysts had expected the placement and marketing numbers to be much higher. They predicted near-month cattle futures would fall as much as 1 cent a pound on Monday in reaction to the report. Live cattle settled .05 cent to .57 cent lower with October at 69.95 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .18 cent lower to .10 cent higher with September at 79.80 cents a pound; hogs were .02 cent to .45 cent higher with October at 37.97 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 1.93 cent to the limit 2 cents higher with February at 50.65 cents a pound. Stock-index futures advanced moderately on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The contract for December delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled 1.50 points higher at 271.65.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Drift Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Bond prices drifted lower Friday in sluggish trading, pushing key interest rates back up to 9 percent again. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s closely watched 30-year issue declined -LRB- point, or $ 1.25 for every $ 1,000 in face value. The bond's yield, which moves inversely to its price and is often an indicator of interest rate trends, edged up to 9.00 percent from 8.99 percent late Thursday. It had stayed below 9 percent for three days. Analysts said the market was stalled by conflicting sentiments. `` This was slow, slower, slowest,'' said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldinger </PERSON>, a principal of <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, an investment firm in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` It was exactly a stalemate.'' The decline occurred despite a new government report that suggested some economic sluggishness. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said business inventories rose 0.3 percent in July after a 0.8 percent rise in June, while sales fell 0.2 percent in July, the first sales decline since January. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, director of money-market research for <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the slowing of inventory investment indicates `` the economy may be moderating, and that's basically a friendly development for bonds.'' But he said the bond market shrugged aside this report as well as other signs of economic moderation over the past few days, including a decline in August retail sales and a drop in energy and commodity prices. `` Many investors are still concerned about the pace of economic growth,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. `` They think the trend in the economy is still upward.'' The worry is that the economy's growth will push inflation higher, eroding the value of bonds and pressuring the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to take steps to slow growth and push interest rates higher. Other bond investors, however, believe inflationary pressures have eased, <PERSON> Goldinger </PERSON> noted. `` We've got some cross-currents here ... it's a big tug of war,'' he said. In the secondary market for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds, prices of short-term government issues were unchanged to 1-16 point lower, intermediate maturities declined 1-16 point to 3-32 point, and 20-year issues lost 3-32 point, according to figures provided by <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a financial information service. The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $ 10 in the price of a bond with a $ 1,000 face value. The <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Bond Index, which measures price movements on all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues with maturities of a year or longer, slipped 0.78 to 1,144.49. Yields on three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills, meanwhile, fell to 7.36 percent as the discount declined 3 basis points to 7.14 percent. Yields on six-month bills slipped to 7.74 percent as the discount edged down 1 basis point to 7.36 percent. Yields on one-year bills edged up to 7.98 percent as the discount rose 3 basis points to 7.45 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the annualized return on an investment in a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bill. The discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at maturity. The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was quoted late in the day at 7 ~ percent, down from 8 \ percent late

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is hoping an updated version of its 12-year-old Apple IIc will sell briskly this Christmas. The new machine is called Apple IIc Plus and is targeted at the consumer market. An Apple IIc Plus with a monochrome monitor will sell for $ 859, down from $ 950 for its predecessor. A color system will cost $ 1,099, a drop from $ 1,203. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, manager of <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION>'s home education marketing group, said the price drop resulted from competition in the consumer market. The main features of the Apple IIc Plus include a faster central processor, allowing it to calculate more quickly; a built-in power supply that makes the computer more compact and lighter in weight; and a built-in 3.5-inch disk drive with more capacity than the earlier 5.25-inch model.

 The price of <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> common stock shot up nearly 10 percent Friday as a flurry of rumors swirled through Wall Street about the entertainment and media giant. Time stock climbed $ 9.37 -LCB- a share to close at $ 106.87 -LCB- in trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Omaha </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, will get up to $ 110 million in federal aid, the Farm Credit System Assistance Board announced Friday. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thor </PERSON>, the board's chief executive officer, said the assistance was approved after an extensive review of the bank's current and projected financial situation and proposed credit managment plan The aid will `` help the bank regain financial viability'' and save between $ 150 million and $ 250 million over the next several years, he said. `` Without assistance, the bank may not be in a strong enough financial position to successfully carry out its plan for the future,'' <PERSON> Thor </PERSON> said. `` The support provided under the law should make the difference.''

The Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 provides that the corporation will fund that assistance through the sale of 15-year bonds, and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> will pay interest on those bonds for the first five years. <PERSON> Thor </PERSON> said the law also requires the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> and the Farm Credit System, or <ORGANIZATION> FCS </ORGANIZATION>, to each pay half of the interest on the bonds in the second five years. The <ORGANIZATION> FCS </ORGANIZATION> will assume full responsibility in the final five years, and the <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> bank must repay the assistance at the end of the 15-year period. The <ORGANIZATION> Omaha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> merged on July 6, forming the <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Omaha </ORGANIZATION>, which provides comprehensive banking services to farmers and ranchers in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Report: Sundstrand Agrees To Record Defense Fraud Settlement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Sundstrand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to pay the government close to $ 100 million in a record defense fraud settlement involving alleged schemes to overbill the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for airplane parts, according to Business Week magazine. A story in the magazine's Sept. 26 issue, released Thursday, quoted unidentified sources it said were familiar with the case as saying the company would enter a guilty plea in the next few weeks, as part of a sealed agreement in federal court in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Business Week said its sources also indicated <ORGANIZATION> Sundstrand </ORGANIZATION> faces possible suspension by the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, which accounts for 42 percent of the company's $ 1.4 billion in annual sales. Furthermore, several senior <ORGANIZATION> Sundstrand </ORGANIZATION> executives could be indicted as soon as next month for their alleged roles in the scheme, the magazine stated. `` I have no idea what they're going to print so there would be no way I could comment,'' <ORGANIZATION> Sundstrand </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernam </PERSON> said when contacted by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Even after company officials have read the Business Week article, <PERSON> Vernam </PERSON> said he did not expect <ORGANIZATION> Sundstrand </ORGANIZATION> to comment beyond what it has disclosed in its quarterly reports. The aerospace contractor revealed in a 1987 financial filing with the government that it would face criminal charges resulting from two federal grand jury investigations into alleged overcharges. <ORGANIZATION> Sundstrand </ORGANIZATION> reported that the government was seeking repayment of $ 13.5 million plus interest and $ 102.9 million plus interest in two separate disputes over contract pricing. <ORGANIZATION> Sundstrand </ORGANIZATION> is based in <LOCATION> Rockford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, and operates a subsidiary in <LOCATION> Redmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, that is part of its Advanced Technology Group. In its annual report to the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year, <ORGANIZATION> Sundstrand </ORGANIZATION> acknowledged the `` government has advised that it intends to charge the company with criminal violations'' in <LOCATION> Rockford </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Sundstrand </ORGANIZATION>, which makes flight data equipment, engine start-up systems and other electronic equipment for commercial and military aircraft, said in its <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> filing that it was `` in the process of entering a settlement in one or possibly both actions.'' Such settlements, the company also noted in the filing, `` could result in the imposition of materially adverse fines and penalties.'' <ORGANIZATION> Sundstrand </ORGANIZATION> began putting money in reserve two years ago to cover settlement and legal expenses related to the dispute. The company added $ 76 million in the second quarter to the reserve, which already held $ 50.2 million, resulting in a $ 16.5 million net loss for the period.

<HEAD>Coleco Posts $193.3 Million Second Quarter Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the toy-making giant that is reorganizing under bankruptcy protection, reported a $ 193.3 million second quarter loss on Thursday, due largely to one-time restructuring costs. The loss compared with a profit of $ 752,000, or 4 cents per share, in the year-earlier quarter. Second quarter sales plunged to $ 15.4 million from $ 146.1 million a year earlier. Company officials said the net loss included about $ 105 million related to restructuring costs and expenses associated with current plans to downsize the business. These costs reflect the company's decision to dispose of its outdoor product lines and various operating facilities, company officials said. Also included in the costs are the renegotiation of certain product distribution and royalty agreements, company officials said. Of the remaining $ 88 million of the loss, the company attributed about half to virtual elimination of sales activity due to a lack of funds to acquire and ship products, company officials said. The rest of the loss came largely from the discontinuance of certain products, company officials said. The closing date for the second quarter was extended to July 11, when the company filed a Chapter 11 petition seeking protection from creditors under the federal bankruptcy laws. In the six months ended July 11, <ORGANIZATION> Coeco </ORGANIZATION> lost $ 240.7 million, compared with an $ 8.1 million loss in the year-earlier period. Sales fell to $ 89.2 million from $ 270.5 million. The company has slashed its work force in an effort to cut costs. It has fewer than 600 employees in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, down from an average of 2,500 a year ago. The company produces Cabbage Patch Kids, <PERSON> Alf </PERSON> dolls, Big Wheels palstic tricycles and board games, such as Scrabble.

 Gold prices tumbled nearly $ 7 a troy ounce in busy trading Friday to the lowest point in 18 months, hurt by a tide of fresh selling and evidence that inflation remains subdued. The dollar was mixed in slow trading. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> quoted gold bullion at $ 411.75 as of 4 p.m. EDT, down $ 6.75 from its level of late Thursday and down $ 18.05 from late Wednesday, a combined loss of more than 4 percent. Gold had not traded that low since March 1987. Bullion brokers said people who had hoarded gold as a hedge against inflation were becoming impatient and exasperated because the metal had been falling in value relative to some interest-bearing investments. `` These people are disappointed and shocked and adding fuel to the fire,'' said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>, vice president and bullion dealer at <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. `` The more selling that comes in, the more these people are in a panic.'' Moreover, recent economic statistics in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> suggest inflation will not rise nearly as much has some gold holders had expected, heightening prospects that the metal could test $ 400 an ounce. Gold has not been that low since December 1986. `` There's been a lot of new selling,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>, senior gold trader at <ORGANIZATION> MTB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> metals concern. `` The feeling is you might see $ 400 gold real soon here. I think next week you'll see $ 400 gold.'' <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoen </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montagu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said that based on a technical analysis of gold-price trends, the metal could fall as low as $ 375 an ounce. He predicted more gold investors would dump their holdings. `` They've been holding it and holding it, and it does nothing for you,'' <PERSON> Schoen </PERSON> said. `` Meanwhile you can earn 8 percent or more on a short-term Treasury bill.'' Some traders said there was evidence of big sell orders emanating from the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. Others said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, one of the world's biggest gold producers, had unloaded a large amount of bullion in the Swiss market to raise cash. Gold fell in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to $ 412 from $ 417.75 late Thursday; in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION> to $ 411 from $ 417.50; and in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> to $ 419.84 from $ 423.45. On the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, bullion for current delivery fell $ 6.90 to $ 411.70. Silver fell on the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> market to $ 6.40 a troy ounce from Thursday's $ 6.44 close. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Comex </ORGANIZATION> silver for current delivery fell 14.1 cents an ounce to $ 6.326. In foreign-exchange trading the dollar varied slightly in value, reflecting what money brokers called an uncertain outlook for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency and resilient fear of central-bank intervention to keep the dollar stable. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar rose 0.31 yen to 133.76 yen. Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> it strengthened to 134.25 yen. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the dollar fetched 134.12 yen, higher than its 133.77-yen level late Thursday. The British pound strengthened against the dollar to $ 1.6758, vs. $ 1.6675 late Thursday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the pound sold for $ 1.6787, marginally weaker than its $ 1.6790 level late Thursday. Other late-dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> compared to the levels of late Thursday: 1.8711 West German marks, down from 1.8747; 1.5807 Swiss francs, down from 1.5823; 1.2232 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2225; 6.3630 French francs, down from 6.3763; and 1,399.00 Italian lire, up from 1,398.70. Other late-dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> compared vs. late Thursday: 1.8763 marks, down from 1.8775; 1.5835 Swiss francs, up from 1.5820; 6.3795 French francs, up from 6.3790; 2.1151 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1160; 1,398.50 Italian lire, down from 1,398.87; 1.2232 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2225.

 A federal judge, saying a quick ruling would be `` almost shooting from the hip,'' declined to make a decision Friday on whether to allow the $ 2.5 billion merger of Lucky and Alpha Beta to proceed. After three hours of arguments by attorneys, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> asked for more data on the `` relevant market area'' affected by the proposed merger. Attorneys said they could supply the information by Wednesday and <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> said he would rule soon after that. <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> left in place a temporary restraining order which bars completion of the acquisition of Lucky by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION>, parent company of <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beta </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON> has filed suit to stop the merger. He claims that transaction coupled with the recent merger of <ORGANIZATION> Safeway </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Vons </ORGANIZATION> supermarkets will decrease competition and mean higher prices for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> consumers. Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Horne </PERSON> argued that the merger violates the Clayton Antitrust Act and said that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has never approved a merger between two such gigantic market chains. He suggested the merger will virtually eliminate `` mom and pop grocery stores,'' which will be unable to compete against the giants. `` Without the entry of signficant competititors there will be no competition in this state if this merger is allowed to go through,'' <PERSON> Horne </PERSON> said. Attorney <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothman </PERSON>, representing <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>, the parent company of <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beta </ORGANIZATION>, said the consumer will benefit because <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beta </ORGANIZATION> plans to adopt Lucky's low-price structure. When <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> expressed skepticism about whether low prices would last, <PERSON> Rothman </PERSON> responded that if the chain raised prices, `` Everyone else in the marketplace would cut our heart out.''
