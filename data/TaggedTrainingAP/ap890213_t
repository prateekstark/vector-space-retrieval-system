 When <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON> retired from the backbreaking life of a miner on <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>'s Iron Range, he looked forward to years of peace and leisure. Instead, the 58-year-old <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Della </PERSON>, are spending their golden years at war with a lesbian professor over who should care for their severely brain-damaged daughter, <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>. The professor, <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, says she deserves to be Ms. <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON>'s caretaker because the two secretly considered themselves married before Ms. <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON> was paralyzed in a 1983 automobile crash caused by a drunken driver. <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON> and his wife say the claim is bogus. They insist <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>'s interest in their daughter centers on money <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> has generated by publicizing the case in speeches across the country and a book. `` I hate her with a passion,'' <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON> said from his home in rural <LOCATION> Nashwauk </LOCATION> in northeastern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. `` I ca n't picture an end to this.'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> says the money is intended to help Ms. <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON>, and she questions her parents' motives. `` They would rather she be a vegetable than a lesbian,'' she said. `` Until Sharon's rights are protected, I will fight this.'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, who has become a national spokeswoman for gay and lesbian rights, has helped establish two funds for her friend and organized rallies in 21 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities in August to observe `` Free Sharon Kowalski Day.'' According to court records, the two women had lived together for four years. Ms. <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON>, 32, who was a high school physical education teacher, had named <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, 41, as the beneficiary of her $ 50,000 life insurance policy before the accident. The courts have acknowledged the relationship but have kept <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON> as his daughter's guardian, giving him power to make decisions for her and initially allowing him to deny <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> visiting privileges. But in December, a judge ordered a re-evaluation of Ms. <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON> to determine how soundly she thinks and whether she is capable of making decisions about her own care. Ms. <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON>, who is in a nursing home near <LOCATION> Nashwauk </LOCATION>, has lost the use of her limbs and is unable to speak but can use the fingers of her right hand and communicates by typing, shaking her head and using an alphabet board. Under the judge's new order, anyone is allowed to see her if she `` reliably requested'' to see them. Ms. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said she was granted supervised visits because Ms. <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON> asked to see her in interviews with a psychiatrist. A week ago, the two visited over four days for the first time in 3 -LCB- years. `` I think <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> is soon going to let everyone know that she can control her own future,'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said from Ms. <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON>'s bedside. `` She smiles and she chuckles and she has responded so well. She's been happy to see me. After the re-evaluation, the judge could go as far as declaring Ms. <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON> competent to handle her own affairs, but her parents say such a finding would be impossible. They say <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> has exaggerated Ms. <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON>'s mental abilities and her chances for rehabilitation. `` We're never going to have the real <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON> back,'' said her mother. `` You might get a good response from <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> one day and the next day _ nothing. It would take a miracle to see her recover.'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, who teaches physical education at St. <ORGANIZATION> Cloud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said Ms. <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON> wants to go home with her to St. Cloud; the Kowalskis say their daughter has never expressed that desire to them. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said she could provide better care for Ms. <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON> because she has more talent and education than her parents. `` I made a lifetime commitment to <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, and I want to honor that,'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON>'s doctor, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, opposes moving her from the nursing home. He said home care would be out of the question because <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> is not certified to care for someone as severely disabled as Ms. <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON>. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> admits she has started other relationships. `` I have found that there are several people in the world that I can have relationships with,'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. `` But I do n't know if I can fall deeply in love with another person like I did with <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> say they are likely to be battling each other as long as Ms. <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON> is judged incapable of handling her own affairs. `` If this keeps up I probably do n't have much time left,'' said <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON>, who has suffered two heart attacks in the past year that he attributes to the stress. `` My heart can only take so much.''

 Thousands of people prayed for rain in northern Italian churches and some parched communities planned religious processions, hoping to bring an end to one of the worst droughts in years. At 1,300 Roman Catholic churches in the diocese of <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> on Sunday, priests invoked `` the rain that restores the earth and air,'' according to the diocese. Churchgoers in <LOCATION> Bergamo </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Genoa </ORGANIZATION> have also been praying for rain as sunny, dry weather threatens crops and left ski slopes bare. Several parishes in small towns south of <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> were planning processions along the Adda river if rain did not arrive in the next few days, the Italian news agency <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> has received only half the precipitation it usually gets in the September-January period. The <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> area has had one rain shower since November 24, while <ORGANIZATION> Genoa </ORGANIZATION> has been dry for four months. The lack of rain has prompted limits on private water use and contributed to brush fires that have scorched thousands of acres in northern <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. The dry weather is the result of a high-pressure system that has remained over the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> for months, meteorologists say.

 In returning <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> to power, <PERSON> Jamaicans </PERSON> opted for a new style of leadership, decisively rejecting the tough economic solutions and autocratic demeanor of conservative incumbent <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON>. The island also emerged from its short but tense election campaign with an improved record on controlling political violence. Preliminary indications were that the charismatic <PERSON> Manley </PERSON>, a radical-turned-moderate leader with a new pro-business image, won 44 of 60 seats in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in Thursday's voting. <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>'s leading political analyst and pollster, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indies </ORGANIZATION>, said he thought there would be no fundamental policy shifts under <PERSON> Manley </PERSON>, who was prime minister from 1972 to 1980. `` There will be the same policies, but a different style of leadership,'' <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said. `` He really feels obsessed with correcting his mismanagement during the 1970s.'' <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON>, a technocrat and hard-nosed manager, was regarded as a friend of big business, which is wary of <LOCATION> Manley </LOCATION>. `` There definitely are going to be memories of what happened in the past,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Thwaites </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sector </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, the country's main business group. But he said if <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> carries out his current proposals, `` there will be very little change in the economic policies of the country.'' <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> appropriated private farms and heavily taxed business during his previous government. Now, he says he has `` abandoned all thoughts of nationalization'' and wants to give private enterprise a free hand in developing the economy. <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON> improved the island's economy, especially tourism, but he did it by doubling the foreign debt to about $ 4 billion, raising taxes, laying off thousands of workers and cutting back spending on health and education. Prices rose sharply, leading to food riots in 1985. `` The program he -LRB- <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON> -RRB- has carried out has been very rigid,'' said Stone. `` And he's paying the price for it.'' <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON>, a staunch ally of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and close political friend of <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, said he was afraid the results of his economic measures had not reached enough people. `` You see the results, yes, but the results have not reached enough people, -LRB- so -RRB- that enough people will say ` Yes, well, we took the medicine and we've benefited,''' he said recently. He said he was forced to take unpopular measures because of the near-bankrupt state of the economy when he took office in 1980 after eight years of <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> rule and the collapse of the bauxite industry in 1983. He said younger voters had no memories of how bad things were under <PERSON> Manley </PERSON>. <PERSON> Manley </PERSON>, known by his most ardent supporters as `` <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON>'' after the Old Testament prophet, pledged to revitalize schools and hospitals he said were neglected for eight years under <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON>'s cost-cutting administration As prime minister, <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> gained an international reputation as a firebrand socialist. He forged close ties with <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> and brought in scores of <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> doctors and technicians. In recent years, he has turned sharply to the political center as a social democrat. The 64-year-old leader has been saying he is an older and wiser man, and on election night Thursday he thanked the <LOCATION> Jamaican </LOCATION> people for giving him a `` second chance.'' <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> said he would restore relations with <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> but was more interested in working with the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration and Western lending institutions such as the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. He said his first foreign trip as prime minister will be to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to establish `` the widest and most constructive'' relationship possible with the new administration. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration wo n't be pleased that <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> is reopening the <ORGANIZATION> Cuban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, which was closed by <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON>, but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say they are encouraged by <PERSON> Manley </PERSON>'s pledge to limit the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> presence and influence to formal diplomatic ties. Policy issues were overshadowed during the campaign by fears that bloodshed among rival political supporters would further split the nation of 2.4 million and wreck tourism, which brings in $ 600 million a year and is <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>'s top earner of foreign exchange. The tourism industry still is recovering from a sharp drop in visitors in the aftermath of Hurricane Gilbert, which slammed into the island Sept. 12, killing 45 people and causing $ 1 billion in damage. In 1980, when <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>'s last nationally contested election was held, an estimated 700 people were murdered over a nine-month campaign. This time, 13 died in campaign-related shootings and stabbings. But in comparison with the mayhem of 1980, the election appeared to mark a turning point in Jamaican politics.

<TEXT>
 The gunfire has stopped, the dictator is gone and the celebrating is over. Paraguayans now must get down to the business of adjusting to life without the only president most of them have ever known. On the surface, the future looks brighter for this South American nation of nearly 4 million _ holding promises of new leadership and perhaps a more representative government. The likelihood that another general will replace ousted leader Gen. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, now in exile in neighboring <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, bothers few Paraguayans. Neither does the certainty that political power will remain in the hands of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, a pillar of <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s support throughout his nearly 35 years in power `` It does n't make any difference what kind of government we get, it has to be better than the one we had,'' said 20-year-old <PERSON> Celso </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, one of the thousands of citizens who went into the street to celebrate the fall of the 76-year-old dictator. Gen. <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, whose tanks and troops ousted <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> in a violent coup Feb. 3, seems to be many things his predecessor was not. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> quickly dissolved <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and called for elections May 1 in which all parties _ except the Communists _ can participate. He promised to respect human rights, freedom of expression and the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. He named an 11-man Cabinet that even opposition members grudgingly admit includes <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>'s most successful and talented administrators and technocrats. The new government will have to deal with urgent problems, including poverty, economic stagnation, 30 percent annual inflation and a foreign debt of nearly $ 2 billion. The church, which had become a leading opposition body in this predominantly Roman Catholic nation, promised the new president its support. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, 65, has denied rumors he may be linked to drug traffickers who move cocaine through <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>, and he pledged to cooperate with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and international agencies seeking to end the drug trade. In <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>'s first presidential press conference, the affable, self-assured cavalry general left open the possibility he may run for president. `` I am simply a soldier, not a politician,'' <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> told reporters. `` However, if I can be useful to my country, I will do what I am asked.'' <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Argana </PERSON>, the new foreign minister who was seen as the party's most likely presidential choice, quickly denied reports he would run and endorsed <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which claims membership of 1.4 million and has ruled since 1947, has said it will call a convention soon to select candidates and new party leaders. The 101-year-old party was badly split in August 1987 when a small but fanatical pro-Stroessner group usurped party leadership in a battle over how to prepare for post-Stroessner rule. The <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> backers, an inner circle of militant government and party officials, favored continuation of hard-line authoritarian rule, possibly under <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s eldest son, <PERSON> Gustavo </PERSON>, an air force colonel. The majority, calling themselves `` traditionalists,'' favored some relaxation of iron rule and the eventual replacement of <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> with a civilian president. Recently, the situation was complicated by <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s failing health. The nation, accustomed to seeing his picture every day in the newspapers, was astounded in September when he vanished for two weeks for an unannounced prostate operation. In a nation where virtually every decision was made by the president, the wheels of government ground to a halt. `` The president used to personally sign most government documents,'' said a foreign diplomat. `` Some of our transferring personnel even received shipment orders for their household goods signed by him.'' <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>'s decision to act, diplomats and politicians say, came when <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> ordered him to give up command of the powerful <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> and retire, or accept a political post, possibly defense minister, without command of troops. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s downfall sent citizens _ 70 percent of whom had known only <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> as president _ into the streets to celebrate. Rival politicians, bitter enemies for years, embraced, danced and sang. The nation's opposition political parties face new problems. Most were unrecognized because they had not been allowed to participate in the political process. `` The hinges of our political limbs are rusty from lack of use,'' said <PERSON> Euclides </PERSON> <PERSON> Acevedo </PERSON>, president of the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Febrerista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Laino </PERSON>, popular head of the National Accord, a loose grouping of four opposition parties, suggested the opposition needs `` as much as a year'' to organize to effectively compete with the <ORGANIZATION> Colorados </ORGANIZATION> in elections. Political leaders largely discount the possibility that <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> or his son <PERSON> Gustavo </PERSON> could effectively organiize any effort to return to power. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> supporters were hard to find after the coup and they spoke with reluctance. `` I have to admit that I do n't think that <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> was all bad,'' said a taxi driver as he drove through streets of happy demonstrators following the coup. `` He gave us peace and he built schools for our children and roads where there were only mudholes before.'' `` Look at those people,'' he said, nodding toward the demonstrators. `` If <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> were still in power, most of them would be cheering for him instead of <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>.''

 <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> sweet potato growers have an identity crisis on their hands.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s `` old-boy club,'' which for generations has cheered on former senators if they advanced into the upper reaches of the executive branch, has come unglued under the weight of former Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>'s nomination to be secretary of defense. Tower's <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation is in serious jeopardy, the nominee battered by unproven accusations of heavy drinking, womanizing and lack of objectivity when it comes to defense contractors. Many had expected that Tower's nomination to be the nation's defense chief would enjoy an effortless slide down a carefully greased chute Tower, after all, had been one of the powers of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> where he served for two dozen years and presided as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> _ the same panel now being asked to confirm him. If he expected special treatment, he did n't get it. Instead, his nomination became snared in a web of allegations and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigations. Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., the current <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> chairman, had made clear months before last fall's election that he intended to subject new nominees for top Pentagon positions to intense scrutiny in an effort to improve the quality of key officials `` I said several times that it was n't going to be an old-boy hearing, that we were going to have a thorough review.'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> says. `` The presumption that it was going to be something less was wrong from the beginning. Period.'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> calls the Tower screening `` the most exhaustive process and investigation anyone's gone through in my memory in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` I think everybody thought that the old-boy network would work as it always has and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> would go sailing through, but it has n't worked that way,'' said Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Exon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Neb </LOCATION>., the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s second-ranking Democrat Many members, including <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, speak of the process of sifting and judging the merits of allegations against Tower in terms of personal pain. The pain is evidently more intense against the backdrop of a courtly, clubby institution in which members routinely refer to colleagues as `` distinguished'' and `` honorable'' and hasten to smooth over the wounds of legislative combat with flowery compliments. `` This is a painful process,'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> says. `` It's painful for the nominee, painful for the president, painful for the committee and painful for me. It's frustrating. It's not enjoyable.'' In part, Tower's troubles may stem from the fact that he apparently entered the confirmation process with a relatively low reservoir of good will among his former colleagues. Many senators say privately that they were not fond of what they say was Tower's testy temper and autocratic operating style. Few are willing to say that in public _ but some are. `` Tower is a former member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. But it is probably also the case that he does n't have a lot of intimate friends here or any aura of popularity or good will,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ind </LOCATION>., who was chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Relations committee at the time Tower headed Armed Services `` He is not necessarily a person who ingratiates himself with anybody,'' <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON> said. Some Republican senators are saying that while they remain publicly supportive of the Tower nomination, it is more out of a sense of loyalty to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, rather than out of any sense of loyalty or affection toward Tower. `` They are saying, ` we owe it to the president, not Tower,''' <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON> said. `` I do n't notice anything clubby in this one at all,'' he said. The question inevitably is raised of whether the Tower nomination is being hammered by old-fashioned partisan politics. Some Republican operatives are saying exactly that, accusing the Democrats who control the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> of causing difficulties for the new administration in part to assert their majority status, and in part as an expression of frustration over their party's defeat in last year's presidential contest. Not so, says <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, whose own credentials are hardly those of a left-wing <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> basher. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., a former secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and the panel's ranking Republican, backs him up The two lawmakers say they have worked as 50-50 partners throughout the hearings and investigations and constantly shared information. `` <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> has been fair, equitable and _ steadfastly _ he has been non-political,'' <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said late last week. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said he put the question of fairness directly to Tower himself. `` I said, ` <PERSON> John </PERSON>, if you were in the position <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> and I now find ourselves in ... would you do it any differently?''' The answer? `` Sen. Tower looked us right in the eye and said, ` No,''' <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said.

 The Soviets are bending over backwards to comply with the treaty calling for destruction of all intermediate-range missiles, a sign that they are eager for a more sweeping pact to slash nuclear arsenals, says the chief <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inspector. `` The whole thing is going a whole lot better than we expected,'' said Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Lajoie </PERSON>, who in 19 previous years of dealing with the Soviets had found little reason to love them. <PERSON> Lajoie </PERSON>, 52, has served two stints as a military attache in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and was commander of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> liaison office in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in 1985 when Soviet soldiers shot and killed American Maj. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON>. `` Each of us has some unpleasant little anecdote,'' said <PERSON> Lajoie </PERSON>, whose face was smashed when the truck in which he was riding was rammed from behind by a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> vehicle in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> five months after the <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON> incident. But, says <PERSON> Lajoie </PERSON>, `` we are professional officers.'' And `` there is a political will on both sides to make this thing work. But I am under no political pressure to whitewash the process,'' <PERSON> Lajoie </PERSON> said in an interview. He said the Soviets clearly view verification of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces, or INF, treaty as a foundation for cooperation on the more ambitious Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty _ START _ to cut long-range superpower weapons by 30 to 50 percent. START talks are stalled while the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration reviews overall <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy. START, said <PERSON> Lajoie </PERSON>, `` is going to be much more complicated'' to verify because the number of weapons involved is much larger and because it calls for reduction rather than elimination of specific systems. Overhead satellites will remain the backbone of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> verification, said <PERSON> Lajoie </PERSON>, but like the INF pact, START calls for on-site inspections on demand at dozens of locations in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the Soviet bloc. Under the INF regime, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also is allowed to keep 30 inspectors outside a Soviet mobile missile plant in <LOCATION> Votkinsk </LOCATION>, 700 miles east of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, while the Soviets leave a similar group in <LOCATION> Magna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lajoie </PERSON> and the other 250 Americans assigned to the inspection agency consult regularly with the START negotiators, and some of the military officers on the START team have accompanied the INF inspectors on their rounds to make sure that lessons are learned. `` There are certain minor provisions for which we would prefer different wording,'' said <PERSON> Lajoie </PERSON>, noting a requirement that inspectors tour a facility within one hour of arrival, no matter what time they get there. Since <PERSON> Lajoie </PERSON> supervised the creation of the <ORGANIZATION> On-Site </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> in April 1988, the Soviets have destroyed 30.8 percent of their 1,836 short - and medium-range missiles, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has destroyed 30.5 percent of its 867 <ORGANIZATION> Pershing </ORGANIZATION> 2 and ground-launched cruise missiles `` We're both a little ahead of the curve'' for the three-year destruction period, said <PERSON> Lajoie </PERSON>. The treaty, negotiated over six years and signed in December 1987, bans ground-launched superpower missiles with ranges of 300-3 ,000 miles He acknowledges that there have been `` a lot of minor glitches. They have been resolved in a gentlemanly way. There is a tradition now of resolving these at the lowest possible level.'' One glitch can not be blamed on the Soviets, said <PERSON> Lajoie </PERSON>. An X-ray machine to be used at <LOCATION> Votkinsk </LOCATION> has not been delivered yet, forcing the Americans to rely on their eyes to spot any medium-range SS-20 missiles the Soviets might try to sneak out of the factory among longer range SS-25's. Last month, Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, a conservative opponent of arms control, accused the Soviets of preventing use of the X-ray device and therefore violating the treaty. <PERSON> LaJoie </PERSON>, however, said, `` it is not a Soviet-imposed delay.'' If the Americans are suspicious, said <PERSON> Lajoie </PERSON>, they can always demand to inspect the inside of the missile canister, a right they can exercise eight times a year. The treaty bans all SS-20 missiles. <PERSON> Lajoie </PERSON>, who spent much of his time as a military attache peering at the outside of Soviet bases under the suspicious gaze of Russian counterintelligence agents, marvels at the `` unique access'' his team is given on strategic rocket bases. `` Everything we have observed is something we have n't observed before,'' he said. But that's not a license to spy. `` Neither side wants the other to move into a sensitive area with a lot of gear,'' said <PERSON> Lajoie </PERSON>. Each team is allowed to carry only one camera, a quick-developing model to photograph disputed items. Since completion of `` baseline'' inspections last summer to verify the actual number of weapons in each arsenal, only one photograph has been taken, by the Soviets, of a ground-launched cruise missile that already had been partially disassembled, a minor deviation from protocol, according to an administration official. Another small misunderstanding arose after an American failed to count one item on a list of weapons components to be destroyed. The misunderstanding was cleared up quickly through an exchange of telegrams, according to the official, who spoke on condition he not be further identified.

<TEXT>
 Led by their Communist mayor, the people of <LOCATION> Terni </LOCATION> have launched a crusade to reclaim St. Valentine, the patron saint of lovers who has attained greater fame abroad than in his native country. On Sunday, the city in central <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Umbria </LOCATION> region launched a yearly award ceremony dedicated to acts of love around the world. Next year, it plans to offer free honeymoons to newlyweds. This steel town wants its decapitated 3rd century bishop to really be its valentine. The Roman Catholic saint for lovers has been as much a mixture of myth, religion and tradition as Easter bunnies or <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON>, who eventually became a jolly red-suited <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION>. The Vatican Congregation for the Causes of Saints says 17 Valentines are listed in the official encyclopedia of saints _ including ones from <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` But we are relatively sure that <LOCATION> Terni </LOCATION>'s is the real Valentine because he is the oldest,'' says <PERSON> Ivani </PERSON> <PERSON> Rossi </PERSON>, president of the Valentian Cultural Center. He has been working to bring back what he says is `` real significance'' to the festivity rather than `` a growth in the Valentine gift industry.'' According to historical accounts from the Middle Ages, Placido, the prefect of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, had the spiritual head of <LOCATION> Terni </LOCATION>'s Christians beheaded on February 14 of the year 270 after having him imprisoned and whipped. <PERSON> Valentino </PERSON> had a garden where, according to legend, he allowed children to play or lovers to meet. While he was jailed <PERSON> Valentino </PERSON> handed the keys of the garden to two carrier pigeons with a message inviting the children of <LOCATION> Terni </LOCATION> to return there during his absence. After his martyrdom, <PERSON> Valentino </PERSON>'s body was brought back here by his followers and buried. The funeral urn was discovered in a cemetery during the 17th century and is now kept in a basilica, minus a tooth given at the time to <PERSON> Leopold </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, who venerated the saint and funded the basilica's construction. Benedictine monks spread the cult of the saint to Anglo-Saxon countries including <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Although <PERSON> Valentino </PERSON> remained the patron saint of <LOCATION> Terni </LOCATION>, town residents _ as well as most Italians _ did n't realize how famous he was becoming abroad, according to the current bishop of <LOCATION> Terni </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> <PERSON> Gualdrini </PERSON>. `` We found, for example, that people knew more about the American mafia ` St. Valentine's Day Massacre' than about St. Valentine himself,'' <PERSON> Gualdrini </PERSON> said in an interview, referring to the Prohibition-era slaying of seven men in a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> garage by <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Capone </PERSON>'s mobsters. `` The commercial value of St. Valentine outstripped his spiritual value,'' he said. `` This was something we had to change, considering <LOCATION> Terni </LOCATION> had probably the world's best known saint.'' A few years ago, the traditionally Communist administration of <LOCATION> Terni </LOCATION>, led by Mayor <PERSON> Giacomo </PERSON> <PERSON> Porazzini </PERSON>, decided to work with the local church on a mutually beneficial project _ restoring some luster to <LOCATION> Terni </LOCATION> and its saint. A tourist marketing test in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> showed the city and the area, with spectacular waterfalls and walled medieval towns and churches, had potential appeal. Now, more than 20,000 Japanese tourists stop at the basilica and tour the area each year _ and <LOCATION> Terni </LOCATION> has its annual ` love' awards ceremony. Among winners Sunday were Nobel Peace Prize-winner <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Calcutta </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Segal </PERSON>, best-selling author of `` Love Story''; actor <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Ustinov </PERSON> and an Italian rescue brigade that recently returned from the Armenian earthquake zone. Next year, the prize ceremony will be carried on a worldwide satellite television program and the city will begin to offer free one-week honeymoons to selected newlyweds.

<HEAD>Prospective Latin Aide Calls For Downgrading Contras</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Democrat who is set to become <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's top aide for <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> was once a strong supporter of the Nicaraguan Contras but now believes other strategies should be pursued for achieving a settlement in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON>, who once advised President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>, believes the new administration should make an all-out effort to build on the peace agreement the five Central American presidents signed in August 1987. <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON>'s views were outlined in a little-noticed paper he co-authored last October which was intended to influence the debate over <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> as the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration was bowing out. The report was published by <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, a human rights group based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Eight others participated in writing the paper, titled `` Peace Through Democracy, A Bipartisan Initiative for the Central American Crisis.'' Although there have been some objections to <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON>'s prospective appointment, administration aides say Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> has indicated that his decision is final. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> has placed high priority on filling the post, vacated last month by <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, with someone who will have more success than <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> did in forging a bipartisan policy on <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. While the policies of the new administration are still in the planning stage, the Central Americans themselves are engaged in a flurry of diplomatic activity. Central American foreign ministers met in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> last week and the five regional presidents were opening a two-day meeting today in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> to discuss the future of the Nicaraguan Contras and other issues. <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON>, 42, helped write a pro-Contra aid speech for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> several years ago but the report he helped write last fall suggests his views on rebel aid have shifted in light of new developments. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> has discussed the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> issue only in general terms but what he has said appears to be consistent with the substance of the report co-authored by <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON>. While hinting that <PERSON> Contra </PERSON> aid may be a last resort at some point, the report suggests that continued pursuit of that approach is tactically unwise because of hostile public opinion in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` Those who favor the immediate resumption of military aid to the <LOCATION> Nicaraguan </LOCATION> resistance are in danger of once again launching a military policy from a weak political base,'' the report said. It said few believe there is a broad enough consensus in support of <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> aid to sustain that approach for a substantial period. Instead, the report recommends giving a `` rigorous test'' to the <LOCATION> Esquipulas </LOCATION> agreement, signed by the five <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> presidents 18 months ago. Among other provisions, the agreement commits <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist government to establish democracy and also bars continued <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the Contras. Six months after the agreement was signed, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> suspended military aid to the rebels, most of whom have since fled to camps along the Honduran border where they receive <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> humanitarian assistance. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration was deeply mistrustful of the agreement, seeing it as a mechanism that would relieve Contra military pressure on the Sandinista government without ensuring a democratic outcome in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. American officials have repeatedly accused the Sandinista government of dragging its feet in adopting democratic reforms. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> maintained that Contra military pressure was the only way to ensure a democratic evolution in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON> suggests that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration should have pursued more vigorously the opening created at <LOCATION> Esquipulas </LOCATION>, the site in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> where the agreement was signed. The <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> report said the accord has `` greater moral and political validity than other approaches being considered.'' On the other hand, it said the agreement has a number of weaknesses, including a lack of `` compelling verification and enforcement mechanisms'' and a reluctance `` to confront Soviet and <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> involvement in the region's turmoil.'' Among other recommendations, the report calls for the establishment of a bipartisan task force to determine whether the agreement is an appropriate instrument for bringing about peace and democracy in the region.

Seventy-eight were Democrats and 58 were Republicans. Members are `` of a like mind concerned about reform in the military,'' said <PERSON> Boxer </PERSON>. At times during the eight-year tenure of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s predecessor, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, the caucus was frustrated. For example, in 1983, it led the fight for the creation of an independent Pentagon operational test and evaluation office, but the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration delayed the installation of a test director until two years later. During the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> presidency and the accompanying record peacetime military buildup, scandals surfaced about <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> payment of exorbitant prices for hammers, wrenches and toilet seats. Of a more serious nature, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has been pursuing a two-year probe of alleged purchasing fraud. The case involves charges that private consultants, hired by military contractors, bribed <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials to obtain inside information that gave companies an edge in bidding for <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> work. `` <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is the true father of the caucus,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Colo </LOCATION>., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and a frequent critic of the past Republican administration The caucus says its purpose is not to advocate `` overall increases or decreases in defense spending, only more effective expenditure of those dollars allocated for national defense.'' `` The notion is not to argue what weapons are needed. We're trying to find a way to make the most of the military for less money,'' said <PERSON> Boxer </PERSON> The caucus began in 1981 after former Rep. <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehurst </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., noticed an article in The Wall Street Journal on military reform The story's author was former <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> senator and onetime presidential candidate <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>. In reading the article, <PERSON> Whitehurst </PERSON> found that he shared some of the same views as <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>. The senator and the congressman huddled on military reform, joined forces with a handful of others and formed the caucus. Initially, the organization concentrated on such military reforms as maneuver tactics and leadership training. Later, as the caucus increased in numbers, it turned its attention to purchasing reform and conventional weapons. The organization says its activities `` are intended to support the regular committee work for a more effective national defense.'' `` We've held hearings we could n't get the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to hold. The caucus has pushed <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Boxer </PERSON> said. The caucus has no budget, no dues, not even an official phone number. Its staff is the staff of the co-chairs who handle mailings and pay for events. The caucus holds frequent briefings and seminars for members on such issues as the <ORGANIZATION> Bradley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fighting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vehicle </ORGANIZATION>, the military budget and conventional defense. This congressional session, the focus will be on promoting legislation to strengthen the procurement system and whistleblower protection, and tighten the revolving door between the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and the defense industry, said <PERSON> Boxer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>. Affecting the reform effort will be the budget crunch facing the Pentagon. In his speech Thursday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed a $ 308.8 billion defense budget for fiscal 1990, eliminating the 2 percent increase proposed by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in January. `` With less funds available, it will be critically important that we get the biggest bang for the buck,'' said <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>. `` Centralized procurement within the department _ this kind of approach is the highest priority on the agenda.'' <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, who has been called a `` cheap hawk,'' jokes that he has to `` live up to his reputation.''

 People who predict the future will have to reveal their past if officials in this gambling resort get their way. City council last week unanimously passed a measure to require palm readers to undergo a criminal check, fingerprinting and positive identification when they go for their annual license. The city currently charges a $ 400 license fee for readers to practice their trade. `` The city ca n't deal in morality, but it can regulate things better,'' said <PERSON> Councilwoman </PERSON> <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmentieri </PERSON>, who proposed the measure. The council will take a final vote Wednesday. Many established readers support the effort. `` People come in here to work for a couple of months, and we do n't know who they really are,'' said <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, part of a palm-reading family that has operated here for more than 50 years. `` We want the tighter restrictions. It gives us the best protection.'' <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Annette </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Boardwalk </LOCATION> phrenologist _ someone who claims to detect character traits in the shape of a person's skull _ said the legalization of gambling 10 years ago has increased demand for fortune tellers' services and the need for tougher licensing regulations. `` We get a lot of bus people who want a reading to see how their luck is running,'' she said. `` Most of <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s readers have been here for a long time. But since the casinos came, a lot of new -LRB- readers -RRB- came in.'' <LOCATION> Altantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> required non-resident workers to register with the city from 1953 to 1972, but it was dropped after civil rights groups complained it violated individuals' rights, Police Chief <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Pasquale </PERSON> said. `` It was a good system, though, because we found people who were wanted for murder in other states,'' <PERSON> Pasquale </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Sheep Production Once Exceeded US Cattle Herd</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When it comes to livestock, it may be hard to realize today that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was once a nation of sheep, not cows. Not anymore, of course. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported last week that the nation's cattle inventory, although down slightly, totaled nearly 99.5 million head on Jan. 1. The number of sheep and lambs increased a bit for the third straight year to 10.8 million. Even milk cows, at 10.2 million head, nearly matched the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sheep flock. And dairy cow numbers were the smallest since 1872. `` Sheep and lamb production has long been an important segment of our economy,'' the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said in a supplemental report. `` Since colonial times, production of sheep and lamb for meat and wool has substantially contributed to our food and fiber industry.'' Before the 1900s, wool production was most important, while sheep and lamb output for meat was incidental. But the report said `` there was a marked change'' from 1870 to 1920 as the production of lambs for slaughter became increasingly important. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> began officially estimating sheep and lamb numbers right after the Civil War. On Jan. 1, 1867, those totaled 46.3 million head having a value of about $ 108 million, or about $ 2.40 per head. `` There were about one-third more sheep than cattle in this earliest count,'' the report said. `` By 1884, sheep and lamb numbers increased to 53.3 million head but exceeded cattle numbers for the last time.'' According to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> records, the cattle inventory in 1867 was 28.6 million head worth an estimated $ 547.9 million, an average of $ 19.13 per head. By 1884, when sheep totaled 53.3 million head, cattle were at 49.8 million. The following year, in 1885, sheep were estimated at 49.6 million. `` Sheep and lamb numbers passed through many cyclical phases,'' the report said. `` Inventory declined after 1884 until 1897 and then increased again until 1909, when almost 50.8 million head were on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farms and ranches.'' The next peak for sheep and lambs was in 1932 when nearly 54 million head were reported. The all-time high was in 1942 when 56.2 million head were being raised to help with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> effort in World War II, both for wool and meat. Inventories dropped after the war, declining to fewer than 30 million head by 1950 and then mostly leveled off. After 1960 through most of the 1970s, sheep and lambs continued to decline and than hovered just under 13 million head from 1977 to 1982. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flock dropped to below 10 million head, an all-time low, on Jan. 1, 1986, before the modest recovery of recent years. A number of causes are blamed for the demise of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sheep industry, the report said. Mostly it has stemmed from a reduced demand for wool, reflecting the intrusion of synthetic fibers and cheaper substitute materials, plus a declining demand for lamb in consumer diets. One big problem has been the difficulty in obtaining and keeping reliable herders to manage and care for range flocks, which are located mostly in the West. The increased competition for public range land also was cited. `` Another important factor which has contributed to the decline is the increasing problem of predators -LRB- such as coyotes -RRB- in many range and farm-flock producing states,'' the report said. `` Also, relatively large imports of lamb and mutton have contributed to the decline of the domestic sheep industry.''

 Last month's trade figures released by the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> showed an impressive gain in the value of agricultural exports from levels the year before, says an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> analysis. Agricultural exports in November, the most recent figures reported, topped $ 3.3 billion, up $ 500 million from a year earlier and the highest for a single month since December 1984, the report said. The gains reflect higher export prices due to tighter <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> supplies stemming from last summer's drought. But from a volume perspective, the gains were more modest, the report said. November shipments rose 2 percent from a year earlier to 11.4 million metric tons. `` So far this year, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural exports ... are commanding a $ 50 per ton premium on the world market over year-ago levels,'' the report said. `` The largest price increases have been in those commodities most severely affected by last summer's drought _ wheat, feed grains and soybeans and products.''

 A new comedy, `` Without Apologies,'' is full of the old-fashioned kind of laughs that come when belief is suspended and theater not overly concerned with realistic situations. `` Without Apologies'' is playing at the off-Broadway <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guild </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Theater </LOCATION>, where it had its <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> premiere Sunday. Irish actress <PERSON> Pauline </PERSON> <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON> shines in the role she also had at the play's debut at the <LOCATION> Dorset </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, Theater Festival. As <PERSON> Gwen </PERSON>, a plump, droll and sensible housewife in a genteelly shabby home, she dithers with delicious timing and inflections. The <PERSON> Thom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> comedy is about the later years of the characters from `` The Importance of Being Earnest,'' the 1895 play that led to playwright <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilde </PERSON> being sued for having libeled the Beaumont family. In the 34 years since <PERSON> Ernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Beaumont </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Pagan </PERSON> -RRB- left <PERSON> Gwen </PERSON>, his bride-to-be -LRB- Miss <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON> -RRB-, at the altar and ran off with <PERSON> Cecily </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nye </PERSON> -RRB-, the fiancee of his brother, <LOCATION> Algy </LOCATION> Beaumont -LRB- <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Knudson </PERSON> -RRB-, the two couples have had no contact. <PERSON> Gwen </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Algy </LOCATION>, the two left behind, married and live in her mother's house, with her mother and a renter upstairs. When <PERSON> Ernie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cecily </PERSON> arrive virtually unannounced for a visit, they bring their daughter <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Brutsman </PERSON> -RRB-, dressed like a child but 30. An unforgiving <PERSON> Gwen </PERSON> says it would be inconvenient for them to spend the night, but they inform her they're broke and moving in permanently. That sets up the plot: <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> get together with the renter -LRB- <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> -RRB-, a jazz drummer who aspires to be a comedian? <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Cecily </PERSON>, played by the blonde, willowy Miss <PERSON> Nye </PERSON>, forsake plummy-voice <PERSON> Ernie </PERSON> for <LOCATION> Algy </LOCATION> and scramble the family again? And there's one more question: Will the <LOCATION> Beaumont </LOCATION> descendants sue <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, director <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Lansbury </PERSON> and masterful set designer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wulp </PERSON>? With jokes about the footstool, a brotherly competition over war wounds and Miss <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON> crooning her comic lines up and down her vocal register, one is simply laughing too much to care.

<HEAD>Gun Groups Fight Assault Weapon Limits</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Gun owner groups are opening fire on congressional efforts to outlaw semiautomatic assault weapons such as the one used in last month's <PERSON> Stockton </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, playground massacre that left five children dead. `` I think a lot of people could get hurt politically in voting for this bill,'' says <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON>, public affairs director of the <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms. He and other gun lobbyists were on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> last week to combat a bill sponsored by Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, that would halt sales of AK47s, Israeli-made Uzis and a host of other military-style weapons with banana clips, wire stocks and sinister-looking snouts that roughly fall under the heading of assault rifles. Led by the efficient and well financed <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, gun lobbyists base their muscle on support from hundreds of thousands of hunters and other gun owners across the country who fear they will lose their weapons. Lawmakers have long been reluctant to tangle with the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> for fear of repercussions at election time. The <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>'s power, however, may have waned a bit in recent years when lawmakers approved a ban on plastic guns that fail to register on metal detectors and required the attorney general to come up with a plan to keep firearms out of the hands of criminals. The <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> ended up supporting the plastic gun ban after initial opposition failed to scuttle it. Handing the more complicated assignment to the attorney general represented a compromise struck after the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> balked at a House-passed plan to do no more than study the problem. Opponents of the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>, however, say there is no question that it still wields considerable power. `` The <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> has intimidated members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in a political sense with their money and their political muscle,'' says Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Feighan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, who was defeated last year in an effort to win approval of a seven-day waiting period for gun buyers. He is trying again this year. <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, however, was re-elected handily while under attack by the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>. His supporters say the criticism was offset somewhat by an endorsement from the <ORGANIZATION> Fraternal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Order </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>, based in part on his support for gun control. They say the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> may well pass assault rifle legislation this year. The current round began shortly after a Jan. 17 incident in which a gunman opened fire with an AK47 on 400 children on a playground outside the <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. Five youngsters died and 29 were injured along with one teacher Three persons remain in the hospital. First to respond with legislation was Rep. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>. `` The slaughter of citizens on the streets and children in the schoolyard by weapons designed for slaughter on the battlefield must be stopped,'' delared <PERSON> Berman </PERSON> His bill, however, has not generated wide support, even among gun control advocates, mainly because it bans possession of assault rifles and thus requires owners to turn them in to police or the local sheriff. By contrast, <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>'s bill would ban sales of the weapons but not possession. Trying to collect huge numbers of semiautomatic rifles already in private hands could plunge the bill into a political quagmire, control advocates fear. Other <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> congressmen, including Reps. <PERSON> Vic </PERSON> <PERSON> Fazio </PERSON>, D-Calif., and <PERSON> Fortney </PERSON> H. -LRB- Pete -RRB- Stark, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., have been searching for a less stringent And any bill clearly has a long, hard haul to reach floor passage. In the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Democrat <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s Judiciary subcommittee on the Constitution is believed to be closely divided over whether to push legislation this year. But even if it is blocked there, <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> still can go to the floor and appeal to the whole <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to attach his bill to other legislation. <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> lobbyists say guns dubbed assault weapons are not much different from more traditional hunting guns. They call the major difference cosmetic and point to the military-style appearance of the AK47s and Uzis. `` There is no functional difference between those firearms that are currently being called assault rifles and what would be called traditional hunting rifles,'' says <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> federal lobbyist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Conover </PERSON>. He claims that <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>'s measure would not only outlaw rapid-fire grease guns and pistol-gripped, round-drummed `` streetsweeper'' shotguns but such old standbys of the sportsman as the wooden-stocked <PERSON> Remington </PERSON> model 4. The same disclaimer of any `` functional difference'' was expressed at last week's hearing by <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Conroy </PERSON>, acting deputy associate director for law enforcement of the bureau of alcohol, tobacco and firearms. But he also expressed sympathy with the aim of the legislation to take assault weapons out of the hands of criminals. <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman have been arguing that a ban on the weapon would not really work because it would be disobeyed by criminals and kept out of the hands of law-abiding hunters and other sportsmen. But <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> scoffs at that notion. `` We know of only one instance in which this was used for hunting,'' he declared last week. `` When a psychopath in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> went hunting school children.''

<HEAD>Drug Addiction Turned Actor Into `A Sick Kid,' Mother Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Actor <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bridges </PERSON> is `` a sick kid'' victimized by drug addiction, according to the mother of the former teen-age star of `` Diff ` rent Strokes,'' who is jailed on attempted murder `` It's hard to believe it's come to this,'' said <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Bridges </PERSON>, adding that family problems and early celebrity status have hurt her 23-year-old son. Earlier this month, Bridges was charged with shooting <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Clay </PERSON>, 25, in both arms and the chest in a house known as a drug hangout. An associate, <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Duckett </PERSON>, 30, is accused of slashing <PERSON> Clay </PERSON>'s face with a knife. Bridges is being held without bail until his preliminary hearing Friday and faces a maximum sentence of life in prison if convicted. `` I do n't know what a drug addict is capable of,'' his mother said last week. `` But I know that <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bridges </PERSON>, my son, is not capable of shooting someone like that.'' The attack came 10 days after Bridges was arrested for investigation of possessing cocaine near the house, police said. Previously, he received a suspended sentence in January 1987 after pleading no contest to making a bomb threat, and he was fined for carrying a concealed weapon in 1983. `` The drugs and the pressure have made <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> a sick kid and he should n't be made out to be some criminal,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bridges </PERSON> said in an interview in Sunday's Los Angeles Daily News. She said her 1984 divorce from <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bridges </PERSON> contributed to their son's troubles. `` I'm only just understanding how deeply hurt <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> was,'' she said. Actor <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> <PERSON> Bain </PERSON>, who played Bridge's adoptive father in the TV situation comedy `` Diff ` rent Strokes,'' said Bridges was angry and erratic toward the end of the series, apparently because of financial problems and his parents' `` He was so sensitive,'' <PERSON> Bain </PERSON> said. `` Just the kind of kid you knew was n't going to handle all the problems real well.'' Bridges made his first commercial at age 6 and starred in the television comedy series `` Fish'' four years later. At age 12 he landed the role as <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>'s brother <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> on `` Diff ` rent Strokes <PERSON> Johnnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON>, Bridges' attorney, said his client's problems are common to young stars after their first big success. `` Like other child stars, <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> grew up faster than other kids,'' <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON> said. `` When the series ended -LRB- in 1985 -RRB-, the adjustment was real tough for him.'' Bridges had trouble getting work after the show's last season. He began using drugs 18 months later, Mrs. <PERSON> Bridges </PERSON> said. `` All of a sudden he started coming home looking strange,'' she said. Bridges told his mother last June of his drug problem, she said. He spent one month in a drug rehabilitation center and stayed clean until November, she said. But his close friend <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Arragon </PERSON> was killed when his motorcycle hit a passing truck, prompting Bridges to take his first drink in six months that night, Mrs. <PERSON> Bridges </PERSON> said. `` That was the last straw,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bridges </PERSON> said. `` After that he began living with those hoodlums in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> -RRB-. He got so crazy I almost called an insane asylum to pick him up. I was afraid he would die out there.''

 About 30 leftist rebels lounge in the shade of tile-roofed porches in the center of this farming town, taking some time to relax while the government considers their proposal to take part in elections. The fighters, some as young as 13, savor soft drinks and snacks out of cellophane bags, flirt with the town's shy girls, cradle babies not seen for weeks or months, play cards with the townfolk. Three rebels, one of them missing half an arm from a prematurely exploded grenade, kick a soccer ball in the cobbled street. There has been a sharp decline in fighting since the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> said last month that it would participate in presidential elections if the March 19 balloting is postponed for six months. The insurgents have also declared a complete truce during the meeting of five Central American presidents taking place in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> today and Tuesday. As the lazy afternoon in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Flores </LOCATION> last week showed, the guerrillas have been permitted at least a brief respite from their arduous life in the mountains. <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Eusebia </PERSON> <PERSON> Benavides </PERSON>, 65, was looking for the son she had n't seen in eight years among the men lounging in the plaza Sitting on a rock beneath its only shade tree, she cast glances full of tentative hope at a tall guerrilla fighter who regarded her with equal anxiety. After a few awkward minutes, the rebel leaned his M-16 against a wall and crossed the 20 yards of sun-baked square separating him from Mrs. <PERSON> Benavides </PERSON>. `` Madre?'' he said, as she _ sure now that they were face to face _ stood. `` My son,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Benavides </PERSON> and her son, who goes by the nom de guerre <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON>, embraced. `` I did n't recognize him at first,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Benavides </PERSON> said later, patting her son on the knee as they sat on a stoop. Smiling a campesino smile with more gaps than teeth, she said, `` He was just a kid when he went away.'' <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> was on R & amp; R because the insurgents initiate most combat in the nine-year-old war against the U.S.-backed government that has claimed an estimated 65,000 lives. The Jan. 24 guerrilla proposal was a dramatic turnabout: the insurgents would participate in elections if they were postponed and if other security and anti-fraud conditions were met. The reduction in attacks in recent weeks prevents the guerrillas' enemies from accusing them of extending an olive branch with one hand while delivering blows with the other <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> took from his knapsack a photograph wrapped in plastic of a young woman and a baby. `` This is your grandson and daughter-in-law,'' he said, handing his mother the picture. Mrs. <PERSON> Benavides </PERSON> told of their frustrated attempt at a reunion last October. Advised by a guerrilla `` correo'' _ boys and girls used as messengers _ that <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> would come down from the mountains to <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Flores </LOCATION>, she made the arduous 10-hour bus trip from her southern province. She waited three days in vain before going home. The day she left, he arrived in town. `` Since no one could give me news of him, I thought he was probably dead. I'm so happy to be able to see him now'' said the old woman, her skin rough and wrinkled from decades of fieldwork. `` I'm in poor health and I know it will be the last time. If the guerrilla proposal is rejected _ as appears likely _ the lull that allows reunions is likely to end.

<HEAD>Fighter Deal with Japan Under Fire</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A potential battle is brewing between <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration over plans to transfer to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> $ 7 billion in advanced aircraft technology developed for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s F-16 fighter. The controversy over <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s proposed FSX warplane casts a shadow over last week's summit visit by Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, the first foreign leader to be hosted at the White House since President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took office. Under the pending agreement, <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> would join forces with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heavy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> to co-develop and co-produce a new-generation Japanese fighter, for deployment in the late 1990s. Proponents say the deal is the best that could be negotiated in view of Japanese refusal to buy wholly American-built planes, and that it fosters beneficial technology transfer in both directions with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> while generating income and jobs for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry. Critics, however, contend the agreement amounts to a technological giveaway that will enable the Japanese to compete more effectively against this country in the global aviation market. They argue that <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> should purchase American-made fighters to help offset the $ 50 billion <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The FSX issue surfaced during a <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> meeting Friday between <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., and a group of other senators involved with trade and foreign affairs During the closed-door meeting, questions over the proposed deal were raised by Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON>, R-Mo., according to Japanese officials who briefed reporters after the session <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> was among 12 senators who signed a letter to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> urging that his administration conduct a complete review of the FSX agreement, which had been negotiated under the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. The letter, organized by <PERSON> Sens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Bingaman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.M. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, said the deal posed complex issues including defense burden-sharing and the `` long-term impact on the health and competitiveness of the American aerospace industry, the only high technology area in which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> remains the undisputed world leader.'' `` We are requesting that you order a complete review of the FSX program within the administration, including the departments of <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>, as well as the Office of the Trade Representative and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> science office,'' the senators told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. After the letter went to the <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION>, Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said at a meeting Thursday with <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> that the administration was, in fact, reviewing the jet fighter project and no decision on it had been made. Japanese officials said <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> urged <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> to process a license quickly and notify <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of the technology export. The Japanese have said they want to start the project before March 31, the end of their fiscal year. A memorandum of understanding on the FSX was signed last November by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Japanese officials. Once the administration finally certifies the agreement, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would have 30 days in which it could vote to disapprove the deal. Fueling the controversy over the FSX was an article Jan. 29 in The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> by <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Prestowitz </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official and outspoken advocate of a hard-line <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stance in negotiations with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Prestowitz </PERSON> said the deal would increase the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> burden of defending <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> `` by diverting scarce Japanese defense dollars ... from immediate procurement needs into a 10-year project.'' Also, he wrote, `` it will transfer technology developed at great expense to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> taxpayers at very low cost to a country whose primary interest is not defense but catching up with <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in aircraft and other high-technology industries.'' <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spivak </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION>, responded that under the deal American industry _ including the No. 2 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense contractor and other companies _ will receive 35 percent to 45 percent of the $ 1.2 billion being spent on development of the FSX as well as a comparable share of the $ 5 billion production program. The agreement offers a chance `` to provide jobs for American workers and to bring many hundreds of millions of dollars into the American economy that otherwise would stay in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> if they were to develop their own fighter aircraft,'' he said. On <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Ill., called the <ORGANIZATION> FSX </ORGANIZATION> deal a `` terrible mistake. He said he hoped <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will be able to `` discourage the administration from following this course before we have a bitter fight about it.'' Sen. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said bluntly about the deal: `` It stinks. ... It's about time we had the courage to stand up and say we're not going to take this any longer'' <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> said if the agreement goes through, `` what will take place is that 10 years from now, they -LRB- the Japanese -RRB- will build the superior airframes, they will have the superior technology that we've helped them obtain by turning over some of our technical base as well in this deal.'' In the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, Rep. <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, D-Calif., said he was `` very disturbed'' about the FSX technology transfer `` We ca n't prevent the Japanese from building their own domestic aerospace and defense industries,'' he said. `` But I see no reason for us to hand them the blueprints at a very modest price.''

 More than 2,000 people invaded a housing development to see a little American bird, the first golden winged warbler recorded in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. At one stage Sunday, police with bullhorns had to control the crowd as the birdwatchers, equipped with binoculars, telescopes and cameras, strained for a glimpse of the warbler at <LOCATION> Maidstone </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kent </LOCATION>, 40 miles southeast of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Some of the visitors were from <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>, a British visitor who traveled 270 miles to be there, said ` `` I've been all over the country to look at rare birds and a crowd of a few hundred is not unusual but I've never seen anything like this.'' `` There were well over 2,000 people present when I was there and at times roads were choked and traffic could hardly move,'' he said. `` This must have been the largest gathering of bird-watchers to look at one bird there has ever been,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Millington </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Birdline telephone information service, whose report about the warbler drew the crowds. The warbler is thought to have been blown across the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> in the fall of 1988 while migrating from its breeding territory in the northeastern <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and southeast <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> for the winter.

<TEXT>
 The astronaut who commanded the first post-Challenger mission was not medically qualified to fly and another astronaut, who is colorblind, received a waiver so he can go into space, a newspaper reported Sunday. The <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> medical qualification board recommended last year that space shuttle Discovery commander <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON> be disqualified because of kidney stone problems, but was overruled, the <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION> reported. Sources, who asked not to be named, also told the newspaper that <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandenstein </PERSON>, chief of the astronaut corps, failed an eye test in 1987 but received a waiver to fly again, the newspaper said. In both cases, the sources said Rear Adm. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Truly </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s associate administrator for flight operations at <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> headquarters, interceded. The sources are active members in Flight Crew Operations and in the Space and <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Directorate </ORGANIZATION>, which includes the flight medicine clinic and medical operations branch at the space center, the newspaper said. Truly declined to comment on individual medical cases Friday. `` I try to do two things,'' Truly said. `` I try to make sure from the management view that the -LRB- medical -RRB- process works, that individual health problems are treated fairly by the -LRB- medical qualification -RRB- board and management, and secondly to protect the rights of the individual involved, and the major objective is to get healthy astronauts to the launch pad for the mission.'' Truly's spokeswoman <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Keegan </PERSON> said Sunday she also could not comment on specific medical cases. <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said: `` Neither <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandenstein </PERSON> _ nor any other astronaut for that matter _ has received preferential treatment in the consideration of medical issues.'' During October interviews and again last week, <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brandenstein </PERSON> would not discuss their medical records, the Chronicle said. Sources said the Space Medicine Board grounded <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON> early in 1988 because of a kidney stone problem, but the recommendation was later overruled, and subsequently reversed. <PERSON> Brandenstein </PERSON> failed the Farnsworth Lantern color perception test in 1987, sources said, but received the only waiver ever issued to an astronaut for colorblindness. Some of the most important of about 2,000 circuit breakers and switches on the shuttle orbiter are color-coded, including some of those used in the launch and re-entry, a source said. <PERSON> Brandenstein </PERSON> is scheduled to command the <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> space shuttle in November. He has flown on two previous shuttle flights, in 1983 and in 1985. <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON> flew on shuttle flights in 1983 and 1984, as well as commanding the Discovery flight last September. He has said the Discovery flight was his last shuttle mission. <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON> had a kidney stone dissolved at <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> last April, but the process does n't guarantee that another kidney stone will not form.

The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> indicted <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in February 1988, alleging he protected drug-runners in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and conspired to distribute narcotics. When President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> tried to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> later that month, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s congress replace <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which still recognizes <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> as president, then imposed economic sanctions on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in an attempt to force <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to resign. `` It was a total failure,'' said a radio station director, who demanded anonymity for fear of reprisals. `` It was a bluff and <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> knew it was a bluff. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> knows the gringos _ he has worked for them.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> appealed to anti-Yankee sentiment, portraying himself as a <PERSON> David </PERSON> fighting the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Goliath </LOCATION> in campaign-style speeches in the countryside. The Panamanian government blames the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for the economic crisis; and the opposition says the sanctions only gave the government an excuse for poor economic stewardship. `` In 1987 there was a $ 200 million budget deficit,'' said industrialist <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Valencia </PERSON>. `` The economy was worn out, stimulated only by massive borrowing.'' Until a year ago, the construction industry had boomed and international banking and business through free trade zones had spurred the economy. In 1988, the gross national product declined by 10 percent, unemployment rose 22 percent and economic activity fell by 32 percent. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> also experienced a severe cash shortage and has stopped payments on a nearly $ 5 billion foreign debt. `` We estimate that 60,000 people lost their jobs in 1988,'' said <LOCATION> Valencia </LOCATION>. The opposition has not been able to make political strides from the economic hard times in this country of 2 million people. Its only leader with popular appeal, <PERSON> Arnulfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Madrid </PERSON>, died in August, leaving the opposition squabbling over his successor. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>, thrice overthrown by the military between 1941 and 1968, was the only political figure with wide appeal besides populist military dictator <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON>, who died in 1979 in a plane crash. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> considers himself <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON>' political and military heir. In a dinner speech Jan. 17 to roaring crowd of businessmen, military officers and government officials, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> warned of a possible reduction in the bureaucracy and even the elimination of some government agencies. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s economic problems require a political agreement here and abroad, said <PERSON> Richa </PERSON>. `` The government alone can not negotiate with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar was stronger against the Japanese yen Monday, while stock prices declined moderately in reaction to a hike in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prime lending rate. The dollar ended the day's trading at 128.30 yen, up 0.65 yen from Friday's close of 127.65 yen. It traded in a range of 128.20-128 .63 yen and was quoted at 128.50 yen at midday On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues, a 53.56-point winner Friday, closed 146.67 points or 0.4 percent lower at 31,985.32. It finished last week at a record high 32,131.99 points. A hike in the prime lending rate from 10.5 percent to 11 percent by many American commercial banks and the news of a higher-than-expected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> producer price index for January, both announced Friday, combined to spur the dollar's rally, said a dealer at the Bank of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. The dollar dipped slightly in midmorning selling, but rebounded somewhat later. Trading was slow, the dealer said. The dollar's direction hinges on what happens to overseas interest rates, so players here are inclined, in the absence of any compelling incentives to trade during <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> business hours, to let the European and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> markets take the lead, the dealer added, speaking on condition of anonymity. The prime lending rate is closely watched because bankers use it as a basis for calculating interest on corporate loans and for determining various types of fixed and adjustable-rate consumer loans, including home equity loans. Higher <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates make the dollar more attractive to foreign investors, but tend to have a negative impact on stock prices. <PERSON> Kazuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakamura </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Wako </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> share prices declined in reaction to the interest rate hike and also to the defeat of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Sunday in a closely watched parliamentary by-election. The election was seen as an indication of public sentiment toward the <ORGANIZATION> LDP </ORGANIZATION> following the passage of a long-sought tax reform package last December that included introduction of an unpopular 3 percent sales tax.

 Say what you will it about the savings and loan crisis, it has done wonders for the ampersand. Vaguely old fashioned, the ampersand _ that curly little symbol that stands for `` and'' _ seemed to be in a decline until the financial difficulties of the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L industry put it on every front page. For some reason, S & amp; Ls are always abbreviated with an ampersand, just as football's Super Bowls are numbered with Roman numerals. Like everything else, the ampersand has a history. According to <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendrickson </PERSON>, who wrote the Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins, it was invented by <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiro </PERSON>, a freed slave and secretary to <PERSON> Cicero </PERSON>, a Roman statesman, orator and author. <PERSON> Tiro </PERSON>'s job was taking down <PERSON> Cicero </PERSON>'s dictation. <PERSON> Cicero </PERSON> talked fast, so Tiro created the first known system of shorthand, including the ampersand. Tiro's `` Tironian Notes'' saw wide use in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> for nearly a thousand years. The & amp; itself was just a quick way of writing `` et,'' which means `` and'' in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION>. The name `` ampersand'' is a corruption of the term `` and per se and,'' which means `` as follows.'' The Harper Dictionary of Contemporary Usage by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> laments the tendency of corporations to go modern and abandon their ampersands. The <ORGANIZATION> Morrises </ORGANIZATION> note that the ad firm of <PERSON> Batten </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Barton </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Durstin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON> switched to simply <PERSON> Batten </PERSON>, <PERSON> Barton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Durstin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON>, dropping the ampersand and losing `` part of the charm which led <PERSON> Heywood </PERSON> <PERSON> Broun </PERSON> to say that the corporate name sounded to him like ` a beer barrel rolling down a flight of steps.''' In any event, the <ORGANIZATION> Morrises </ORGANIZATION>, getting down to business, decree that the ampersand is to be avoided `` in writing of formal or semiformal nature, save for the most impromptu personal notes.'' However, the ampersand may be staging a corporate comeback, even without the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L crisis' spur of conspicuousness, says <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Bragdon </PERSON>, senior vice president in a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> firm which does `` name development'' for companies changing their images. He said after stiff debate during a yearlong `` identity program'' for <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>, it was decided to abandon the `` and'' in `` PG and E,'' its old symbol, in favor of `` <ORGANIZATION> PG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; E.'' `` We had to resolve once and for all how to represent ` and,''' <PERSON> Bragdon </PERSON> said. `` There were a whole variety of constituencies. Lots of people wanted ` and' and others wanted the ampersand and some thought a very discrete plus sign would be modern and hip. We advocated the ampersand as an inalienable part of the name _ a beautiful, stylized ampersand.'' However, to show how short-lived these victories are, <PERSON> Bragdon </PERSON> said his own firm has changed its name, abandoning an ampersand in the process. It used to be S & amp; O Consultants. The final decision was to go with <ORGANIZATION> Addison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Design </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consultants </ORGANIZATION>, over the objections of founder and chairman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Ohrenschalls </PERSON>.

 Religious leaders say there's no turning back from women in the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> hierarchy now that a 2,000-year, all-male bastion has been broken by the Rev. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' consecration as a bishop Presiding Bishop <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Browning </PERSON>, spiritual leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' consecration Saturday `` means that this church is realizing the wholeness of ministry, the totality of ministry, and I'm sure that others will be following <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> in the days ahead.'' The Rev. <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> <PERSON> Heyward </PERSON>, one of 11 women `` illegally'' ordained in a 1974 service in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> that paved the way for the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s approval of women clergy two years later, said <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' consecration was `` a major step'' for the denomination. `` I think we still have a long way to go,'' she added. `` My experience in the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> is that it really does take some pushing, and I doubt that that's over.'' The ceremony made <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> the first woman bishop in the three denominations that believe in apostolic succession, that church leadership can be traced to the apostles commissioned by <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>. The denominations are the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and Anglican churches. The Episcopal church is one of 28 national branches of the Anglican communion. In her first sermon as a bishop, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> told 400 worshipers at the <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday to resist the temptation to shut their eyes to issues such as racism and AIDS. `` If <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> had not taken risks, we would not be saved,'' said <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, who became a priest in 1980 in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. `` If the Diocese of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> had decided to play it safe, I would not be here wearing a broche and a chimere and a pectoral cross.'' While nearly all of the more than 8,000 people who packed the convention center shouted their approval, others fought to the end to preserve the all-male tradition. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jamieson </PERSON>, representing a group of conservative Episcopalians called the Prayer Book Society, said her `` pretended consecration'' holds church laws `` in contempt.'' The Rev. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkinson </PERSON> <PERSON> Cupit </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> said the election of a woman may represent an `` intractable impediment'' to relations with other the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches. The election of the 58-year-old <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> as suffragan, or assistant bishop, of the Episcopal Diocese of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> in September has been the church's most controversial one in recent years. In addition to being the first woman bishop, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, who is black, is thought to be the first bishop elected after a divorce and the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bishop, at least in modern times, to lack both a seminary degree and an undergraduate college degree. She studied theology through correspondence courses and with tutors, and worked in corporate public relations. While approval of a locally elected bishop is usually perfunctory for the national church, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> barely won approval from the majority of standing committees and head bishops of the 118 dioceses. By Saturday, only 61 standing committees and 66 bishops had given their consent. But that did not matter to <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> when the bishops gathered around her to consecrate her into their ranks. `` I felt during the laying on of hands a part of the ongoing history of the church. I truly felt in apostolic succession at this moment,'' she said. `` I thought it was absolutely incredibly beautiful and moving,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Weisner </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> priest who is the author of `` Pilgrim and Pioneer: A Journey With God.'' She said the diocese has a rough road ahead but, `` I think it's going to be alright. For many women, the service held a special meaning. <PERSON> Millicent </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, a 66-year-old church member from <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, cried when the bishop's mitre was placed on <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' head. `` We did n't think there would be a woman, much less a black woman,'' said <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, who is black. `` I feel very, very happy. In my life, I can see the first woman bishop,'' said the Rev. <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION> Tim-Oi <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, 81, the first clergywoman in the Anglican communion. `` It made me hopeful. Things are realized now.'' Ms. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> stopped functioning as a priest in 1946 in response to pressure from Anglican bishops outside <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, where she was ordained in 1944, but she never gave up her holy orders. On Saturday, she and other pioneer clergywomen helped consecrate <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>. Advocates for women in the ministry said the struggle is not over. As of December 1987, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, there were 868 active women priests in the 2.5 million-member church. The figure is less than the 1,519 women clergy reported by the 3 million-member <ORGANIZATION> Presbyterian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and the 1,460 women clergy in the 1.7 million-member <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> in 1986. `` The significant piece is it -LRB- <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' consecration -RRB- is another turning point. It is n't the end,'' said <PERSON> Marge </PERSON> <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>, president of the Episcopal Women's Caucus. `` Both racism and sexism are still serious problems in the church, as in the world.'' <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> said many women are becoming assistants or getting part-time jobs at churches, but it is still `` almost impossible'' for women to be elected rectors at large churches.

 With the shepherd's crook, robes and miter of an Episcopal bishop, the Rev. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> moves out into a flock divided over the question of whether she has the right to hold her newly acquired rank. To the duties of ordaining priests, granting communion and serving as a liaison among parishes in one of the nation's largest Episcopal dioceses, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Clementine </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> must add the burden of convincing many doubters within her church and other Christian denominations that she is suited to her new role. It is a challenge that <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, no stranger to controversy, says she is ready to take on. Following her consecration Saturday as suffragan, or assistant, bishop in the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> diocese, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> pledged to try to heal the divisions in the church created by her new rank. `` All of us, in the office of bishop, will be reaching out to as many people in the diocese and the whole church as we possibly can,'' said <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, her voice raspy from a cold. `` I feel good. I'm looking forward to getting on with my ministry. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, 58, became the first woman bishop in any branch of Christianity that traces its bishops directly to the time of Christ. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> has been involved in church activities throughout her life. But the first step toward her historic new position may have been taken in 1974, when <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> led a procession of `` the <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> 11,'' a group of women Episcopalians who were ordained priests a full two years before the ordination of women was approved by the whole church. `` I was very much involved in the planning of that service,'' said <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, who was born and raised in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. `` It deeply affected me.'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' career in private business and the church led her to prisons, corporate board rooms, divorce court and the editorial desk of a feisty, liberal publication. Because that path did not include a college or seminary degree and because of what some view as her extreme left-wing views _ to say nothing of her gender _ <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' consecration touched off heated debate. The issue of a woman becoming a bishop would have engendered debate throughout <LOCATION> Christendom </LOCATION> regardless who was nominated. But <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> provoked all the more discussion because of her background. Some of the opposition to her elevation stemmed from her race as well as her sex, said <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, who is black. During the 1960s <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> became involved in the civil rights movement and participated in the <LOCATION> Selma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, march led by the Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. For a decade beginning in 1958, she worked in a public relations firm and, beginning in 1968, for <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s public relations department, ending her career there in 1980 as a senior staff That year <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> assumed the robes of an Episcopal priest and began a career that took her to counseling sessions in prisons and sermons in a city parish. In 1984, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> became executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an organization not officially sanctioned by the church but one with a considerable voice through its publication, The Witness. It was in the pages of this monthly magazine that <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> became known to a wider audience through her regular editorials. She wrote editorials against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s apartheid policies and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. She wrote in favor of homosexual rights and an end to church discrimination against homosexuals. She also lambasted conservative wings of the church on many occasions, sometimes angering as much with her style as with the substance of her commentary. In 1963, after three years of marriage, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> divorced <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON>, which also was cited by some critics. She likes classical music and drinks an occasional glass of chablis. She prefers `` any kind of gourmet food,'' but also likes soul food, especially black-eyed peas. `` I like cooking up a storm for a large crowd,'' she said.

 <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> has taken her place as the first woman bishop in church that traces its heritage directly to early days of Christianity, despite a stormy break with Catholicism during the reign of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> VIII </PERSON>. The 2.8 million-member <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> developed from the <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> and is one of the several independent national churches that belong to the worldwide Anglican Communion.

 Giving chocolates to your sweetie for Valentine's Day could result in good chemistry. `` A chemical in the chocolate hits a pleasure center in the brain,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, a pastry chef instructor at the 8,000-student <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Wales </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Providence </ORGANIZATION>, one of the world's biggest cooking schools. `` As a gift from a lover to a lover, it would certainly help do the trick.'' Chocolate contains phenylethylamine, or PEA, a natural mood-altering chemical also found in the human brain. `` Win a lottery, get a promotion, fall in love, especially fall in love, and your PEA level shoots up.

Up to 14,000 requests in a year have been sent for a special red postmark showing the angel of love, the town's name and the slogan `` There is nothing in this world so sweet as love,'' said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> As </ORGANIZATION> its renown for the love-struck grows, more residents of the community of 10,000 people are getting into the act as volunteer postmark stampers. `` It's involving a lot more people than it has in the past. This year, we opened it up to the community,'' <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said last week. `` Each piece of mail is handled individually.'' Although the postmark is available year-round, the mail requesting it peaks as Feb. 14 approaches. Volunteers stamp the special postmark by hand on each letter. The <LOCATION> Loveland </LOCATION> post office helps publicize the project and asks people to send their prepaid and pre-addressed mail to <LOCATION> Loveland </LOCATION> in a larger envelope. <LOCATION> Loveland </LOCATION> resident <PERSON> Doris </PERSON> <PERSON> Pfiester </PERSON> began the project in 1971 and faithfully pursued it until her 1982 death. Her daughter, <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, took it over and kept it up. This year, with all the added volunteer help, she was able to take a vacation.

 These items from a questionnaire that measures beliefs about alcohol are among the most predictive of risk for problem drinking, says researcher <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>. But he cautions that risk is indicated by the overall pattern of responses to all 90 items, rather than to individual ones. Subjects are asked to mark `` true'' or `` false'' such items as: _ People understand things better when they are drinking alcohol. _ It's easier to play sports after a few drinks of alcohol. _ Drinking alcohol makes people feel more alert. _ Alcohol makes parties more fun. _ Drinking alcohol is OK because it allows people to join in with others who are having fun. _ Drinking alcohol makes people more friendly.

<HEAD>Dollar Rebounds, Stocks Fall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar rebounded against the Japanese yen today, while stock prices declined on profit-taking selling following six consecutive days of record-high closings. Both markets reacted early in the day to a rise Friday in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prime lending rate, which pushed the dollar higher but depressed stock prices. The stock market also reacted negatively to local political developments. The dollar, which fell 1.74 yen last Friday to a closing of 127.65 yen, gained back 0.65 yen on Monday, closing at 128.30 yen. After opening at 128.50 yen, the dollar weakened on mid-morning selling, recovered and later sagged as several banks sold the currency to protect their bond holdings, said <PERSON> Kaneo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogino </PERSON>, a trader at <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION>. It traded in a range of 128.20-128 .63 yen An increase in the prime lending rate from 10.5 percent to 11 percent by many American commercial banks and news of an unexpectedly high <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> producer price index for January, both announced Friday, combined to spur the dollar's early rally, said a dealer at the Bank of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. `` Now everyone's paying attention to interest-rate differentials and inflation, which should be good for the dollar,'' <PERSON> Ogino </PERSON> said. Higher <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates tend to make the dollar more attractive to foreign investors. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues, a 53.56-point gainer Friday, closed 146.67 points, or 0.4 percent, lower at 31,985.32. It finished last week at a record high 32,131.99 points. Share prices declined in reaction to the interest rate hike and to the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s loss Sunday in a closely watched parliamentary by-election, said <PERSON> Kazuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakamura </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Wako </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. `` After the <ORGANIZATION> LDP </ORGANIZATION>'s severe defeat and six straight days of -LRB- stock index -RRB- increase, investors felt it was time to ease off,'' <PERSON> Nakamura </PERSON> said. The election to fill the seat of a Liberal Democrat who died in December was the first race for a national office since the so-called Recruit stock scandal over financial links between <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and prominent politicians and bureaucrats came to light. The election also was seen as an indication of public opinion toward the governing party following the passage of a long-sought tax reform package in December that included introduction of an unpopular 3 percent sales tax.

 This <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General-Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> poll is based on telephone interviews Jan. 4-12 with 1,162 adults in the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The phone numbers were selected randomly and interviews were conducted with the adult who had the most recent birthday. The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the sample. The poll has a 3 percentage-point margin of error, meaning that if every adult American were asked the same questions, the results theoretically would be the within 3 points of the poll's results, 19 times out of 20. The error margin is larger for subgroups _ 5 points, for example, among college graduates. Other sources of potential error in polls include the wording and order of questions. These are the questions in this poll; because of rounding, sums may not total 100: 1.

 Americans widely disbelieve the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s claim to have abandoned terrorism but favor the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and the establishment of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state, a poll shows. Nearly seven in 10 respondents to a <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General-Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> survey approved of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> holding talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, and six in 10 said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should follow suit. But just 6 percent of the 1,162 adults said they believed the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s recent renunciation of terrorism, and 74 percent said they thought the group only made that claim for political gain. The rest were unsure. The poll indicated other misgivings about the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. Respondents were split on whether the organization would coexist with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> or still seek to destroy it, regardless of its recognition of the Jewish state in December. Still, the public endorsed the basic tenet of the Palestinian cause: Sixty-two percent said the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> should have their own country. Eleven percent disgreed. Twenty-seven percent had no opinion. The national poll was conducted Jan. 4-12, the month after <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said his group was recognizing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and renouncing terrorism. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> responded to <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s move by opening its first official talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> rejected the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> declarations as a ploy and continued its refusal to negotiate with the organization. The poll found acceptance of that position: Although most favored such talks, 67 percent said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should not try to force <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to talk with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. But the survey also found some frustration with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s supporters in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>: 35 percent said they had too much influence on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy Twenty percent said pro-Palestinan groups had too much influence. Roughly a quarter of the respondents had no view on many of the questions, reflecting the distance of <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> issues from the daily concerns of many Americans. Significantly more men expressed opinions than did women. Better-educated respondents were more likely to favor dealings with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. While 67 percent overall approved of U.S.-PLO talks, for example, that number swelled to 79 percent of college-educated respondents. Six in 10 of the most-educated group, those who had done postgraduate study, said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should allow the creation of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state on land it occupies in exchange for recognition from the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. Among all respondents, just 44 percent agreed. But respondents in all education levels doubted that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has given up terrorism. And 63 percent overall said some group other than the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> could represent the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> in negotiations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Arab countries have declared the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> the Palestinians' only legitimate representative. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has said it would negotiate with Palestinians, but not with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> members because the organization's charter calls for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s destruction One-third of the respondents thought the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> wants to destroy <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>; about a third believed the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> would coexist with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The last third were n't sure. More of the most-educated group, 55 percent, said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> would coexist with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Still, six in 10 of that group, and five in 10 overall, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should not recognize the Palestinian state the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> declared in November. The rest split between support for recognition and no opinion.

 A desert power plant burns enough cow dung to electrify up to 20,000 homes, thanks to 250,000 cattle, $ 37 million in tax-exempt bonds and an environmentalist-lawyer seeking his fortune as an `` entremanure.'' It's the first commercial power plant that burns only cattle chips for fuel, although smaller facilities `` digest'' manure to produce methane to generate electricity, said Will Parish, founder and president of <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Parish, 36, left his job with a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> law firm to start the <LOCATION> Mill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> company, which he said is dedicated to `` doing well by doing good'' by building profitable but socially and environmentally responsible energy projects The $ 46 million, 17 -LCB- - megawatt Mesquite Lake Resource Recovery Project, financed by the bonds plus $ 9 million from investors, is located next to its fuel supply: cattle feedlots near Imperial in the desert about 110 miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> It fired up in November 1987 and began continuous on-line electricity production last October. `` It truly is a unique plant,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> McCroskey </PERSON>, a project development manager for <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` We are presently buying power from them -LRB- under a 30-year contract -RRB-. The plant satisfactorily passed its operating test last fall. They are considered a reliable energy source.'' The plant runs at 70 percent to 85 percent of its maximum capacity as its construction company, <ORGANIZATION> Lurgi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, `` tweaks'' it toward full net capacity of 15 megawatts, enough to power 15,000 to 20,000 homes using 800 to 900 tons of manure daily, Parish said. The plant runs on the other 2 -LCB- megawatts it produces. Parish said the plant's output represents annual savings of 300,000 barrels of oil that otherwise would be burned for power, and relieves pressure on Imperial Valley landfills. Until the entrepreneur came along, feedlot owners paid to have manure carted away and dumped. It has little value as fertilizer because it contains too much salt and weed seeds. Now <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> buys the dung for $ 1 per ton from 15 feedlots. `` I've been called a manure mogul,'' Parish joked. `` My alma mater ... referred to me in the alumni notes as the class of 1975's first ` entremanure.' Loaders scoop up manure from some 250,000 cattle, and about 60 trucks deliver it to the <LOCATION> Mesquite </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> plant, where `` we stack it like a precious commodity,'' Parish said. Conveyor belts feed 40 tons of manure an hour into the plant, where it is dried and dropped into special furnaces. The heat produces more than 150,000 pounds of steam hourly to drive a turbine and electric generator. Because the power plant qualified as a waste recovery operation, the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pollution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> issued $ 37.2 million in bonds to help finance construction. <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> raised $ 9 million more by forming a limited partnership. Repayment of the 20-year, investment-grade bonds is guaranteed by <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Westminster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have seen a number of unusual proposals, and this is clearly one of them,'' <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Seegmiller </PERSON>, the financing authority's deputy executive secretary, said by phone from <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>. Parish has called the plant `` a cash cow'' because `` manure costs a penny a kilowatt hour, and we sell electricity at 7 cents a kilowatt hour. That translates on an annual basis to a fuel cost of about $ 2 million and gross sales of about $ 10 million, leaving $ 8 million to cover -LRB- other -RRB- expenses and profits.'' While tax-free bonds are attractive, Parish said it was n't always easy soliciting partners to invest a minimum of $ 50,000 each. `` I got questions like, ` What will happen if the cattle get constipated?''' Parish recalled. The power plant yields about 160 tons of ash daily, but Parish expects to be selling all of it by year's end as an additive to paving materials and fertilizer and an absorbent to soak up toxic contaminants from geothermal energy wells. NEA now is building a $ 60 million, 17-megawatt power plant next to the manure plant. It will burn manure, wood waste and various agricultural wastes.

<HEAD>City Seeks To Change Charter That Many Claim Has Divided Tulsa</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Every few months, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Breed </PERSON> loads a bus with white people, many of whom have lived in <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION> all their lives, and takes them on a tour of the city's northside. This is the other <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, where most of the city's poorest families live, most of the city's low-income housing is located, much of the city's crime occurs and many of the city's vacant buildings crumble under neglect. This is also where most of the city's blacks live. `` The tour is really designed to take people out of their way to show them a part of <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION> they otherwise would never see,'' said Breed, who is a white volunteer in several groups working on problems in north <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>. `` These problems really do exist here.'' City officials and black leaders hope a proposed change in government that residents will vote on Tuesday will open City Hall to northside blacks for the first time and begin redressing some of those problems. <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION> was once referred to as a `` promised land'' by freed slaves escaping the South, but a 1987 civil rights lawsuit filed by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> claims the city has discriminated against blacks for decades. The city's 1908 charter established a commission form of government, with commissioners elected at-large. A black from the northside has never been elected. The lawsuit, filed after the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> won a similar case against officials in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, claims <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>'s 42,000 blacks are ignored in this predominantly white city of 360,000. That lawsuit could become moot if voters approve a new charter calling for a strong mayor and a council with members drawn from nine districts, including one majority black district. `` With the very force of his knowledge, his influence, and, yes, his role in city government, a black councilman will make a difference to every aspect of this community,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON>, a black attorney assisting the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION> officials vehemently deny the city has discriminated against blacks. They say the proposed new charter is an attempt to introduce a more efficient form of government, not a response to the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>. Still, they said a history of segregation has had its effect on the city's largest minority. `` There's no doubt but that there was a system of segregation that effectively kept blacks from being active participants ... in the local government game in this community,'' Finance Commissioner <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Watts </PERSON> said. `` As to how rapidly we have opened up as a community since the late 1960s, I think there would be a great deal of debate on that perception.'' `` I'm still not ready to say that representation has been denied on a racial basis. I do n't believe that,'' Mayor <PERSON> Rodger </PERSON> <PERSON> Randle </PERSON> said. Blacks trace the racial problems to events that led to a bloody 1921 riot. After that, <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION> complied with state segregation laws at least through the 1960s. The riot `` left a legacy of segregation. It left a legacy that <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION> would tolerate racism,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON>, a black leader. `` It has left a second class of citizens that has not been treated fairly. It has left a legacy of two separate school systems.'' `` This city has been so successful in segregation, most Tulsans do n't even acknowledge it's here; some probably do n't even realize it,'' said state Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, a black native of north <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>. `` But just walk through City Hall, walk through any company. Go into any of the industrial parks in this community and you'll see it.'' `` This is not the legal discrimination that I knew as a child,'' said <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, who was born in 1941. `` There is today a more rigid, covert line of discrimination that is more damaging.'' A 1985 city development study highlighted the damage in the northside, home to three-quarters of <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>'s blacks. It found the median family income in north <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION> is only about half that of the rest of <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and that the median value of homes in the area was less than half that in the rest of the county. Unemployment was twice as high as the rest of the county and twice as many of the area's workers held minimum-wage service jobs. The mayor said he is optimistic voters will embrace the charter, despite the failure of four previous attempts at change since 1954, because many people realize the limitations of the current system. `` It's a time when we should have government by leadership instead of government by committee,'' he said.

 The astronaut who commanded the first shuttle mission since the Challenger disaster had a kidney stone, which should have kept him from space, a newspaper reported. Another astronaut who is scheduled to command a November mission is colorblind, a reason for flight disqualification, but received a waiver to fly, the <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday. The <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> medical qualification board recommended last year that Discovery commander <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON> be disqualified because of the kidney stone but was overruled by Rear Adm. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Truly </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s associate administrator for flight operations in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the newspaper reported. The board also said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandenstein </PERSON>, chief of the astronaut corps, failed an eye test in 1987 but received a waiver after Truly interceded, the newspaper reported. A chief <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> administrator said no rules were broken in allowing the astronauts to fly. `` There have been no special dispensations and there has been no favoritism and there have been no medically disqualified astronauts assigned to the space shuttle missions,'' said <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>'s director. The newspaper said it obtained the information from members of the Flight Crew Operations, which includes the astronaut office, and the Space and <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Directorate </ORGANIZATION>, which includes the flight medicine clinic and medical operations branch at the space center. Truly declined to comment on individual medical cases, but said: `` I try to do two things. I try to make sure from the management view that the -LRB- medical -RRB- process works, that individual health problems are treated fairly by the -LRB- medical qualification -RRB- board and management, and secondly to protect the rights of the individual involved, and the major objective is to get healthy astronauts to the launch pad for the mission.'' During October interviews and last week, <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brandenstein </PERSON> would not discuss their medical records, the newspaper said. The Space Medicine Board grounded <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON> early last year because of a kidney stone problem; the recommendation was overruled and subsequently reversed, the newspaper reported. <PERSON> Brandenstein </PERSON> failed the Farnsworth Lantern color perception test in 1987, but received the only waiver ever issued to an astronaut for color blindness, it said. The approximately 2,000 circuit breakers and switches on the shuttle orbiter are color-coded, and some are used in the launch and re-entry, an unidentified source told the newspaper. <PERSON> Brandenstein </PERSON> is scheduled to command the <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> space shuttle in November. He has flown on two previous shuttle flights, in 1983 and in 1985. <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON> flew on shuttle flights in 1983 and 1984, as well as commanding Discovery's September mission. He has said that the Discovery flight was his last shuttle flight. The Chronicle said <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON> underwent a lithotripsy at <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in April to dissolve a kidney stone The process, however, does n't guarantee that another kidney stone will not form.

 A mild earthquake early today shook a wide area of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, the sixth tremor in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> within 24 hours, officials said. No damage or injuries were immediately reported from the quakes, whose magnitudes ranged from 2.4 to 3.0 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale. The sixth quake struck at 12:01 a.m. and had a magnitude of 3.0 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, according to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Survey </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Earthquake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Golden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo </LOCATION>. It was centered west of the <LOCATION> Golden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gate </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>, the same area as two earlier ones, said seisomologist <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Lomax </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seismology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION>. `` We had several calls from all over the city but so far no reports of damage,'' said a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> police dispatcher who declined to give his name. The first quake, which measured 2.7 on the Richter scale, struck at 11:49 a.m. Sunday and was centered about five miles west of the bridge. Within two minutes, two more quakes, measuring 2.6 and 2.4 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, were felt in southern <LOCATION> Marin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lomax </PERSON> said. At 10 p.m., a magnitude 3.0 quake struck the same general area off the Golden Gate as the first one, <PERSON> Lomax </PERSON> said. A quake that measured 2.9 was centered near <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Leandro </LOCATION>, about 10 miles south of <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, at 10:41 p.m., he said. The <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude. A quake of magnitude 3.5 can cause slight damage. The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> earthquake of 1906 measured an estimated 8.3 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale.

 When the first two black families moved into the virtually all-white housing projects of south <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> last summer, they were accompanied by police. After weeks of protests by neighbors and extensive news coverage, city officials feared a replay of the 1970s riots over the busing of blacks to schools in the working class section. Instead, more than six months later, the two families report little enmity and much hospitality. `` I'm just a neighbor like anyone else,'' said <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinkscales </PERSON>, 37, who lives in a three-bedroom apartment with her 20-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Anjanette </PERSON>, and grandson, <PERSON> Jahman </PERSON>, 4. `` I have n't experienced much animosity since I've been here. I think south <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s in a healing process now.'' The move for <PERSON> Clinkscales </PERSON> and the family of <PERSON> Bessie </PERSON> <PERSON> Payne </PERSON>, 36, was made easier because the two have been friends since high school. Coincidentally, they were both given eviction notices about the same time and applied for emergency housing with the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>. `` My main focus at that time was not to become homeless, not to go into a shelter,'' said <PERSON> Clinkscales </PERSON>, who works as an assistant at a day-care center and pays $ 225 a month for her apartment. `` To me that was just as frightening as moving to south <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> tells a similar story. `` I could n't see myself in a shelter with the children and I saw no reason to be when <ORGANIZATION> BHA </ORGANIZATION> had a three-bedroom apartment available,'' <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> said. Until recently, the projects in the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> neighborhood known as <LOCATION> Southie </LOCATION> were 98 percent white and 2 percent non-black minorities. But since the <PERSON> Clinkscales </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Paynes </ORGANIZATION> moved into <LOCATION> Southie </LOCATION>, several other black families have been placed in the projects. It was in the same neighborhood, separated from downtown by a harbor channel, where years of protests erupted after court-ordered busing in 1974. Whites stoned buses of black children shuttled from the <LOCATION> Roxbury </LOCATION> section. After federal authorities told <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> officials to desegregate the projects last year, Mayor <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> held meetings in south <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> to urge acceptance of the plan. Instead, they booed <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>, a south <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> native, and called him a traitor. When <PERSON> Clinkscales </PERSON> and <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> moved in last July, the city had developed a long-term `` safety plan'' for them in case of trouble. For the first week, the two families were told to check in with police when they left their apartments and when they returned. `` My image was that there was some prejudice here but I'm the type of person who realizes there's prejudice everywhere,'' said <PERSON> Clinkscales </PERSON>. <PERSON> Clinkscales </PERSON> and <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> said in recent interviews that little has happened to make them feel like the targets of bigotry. `` When I moved in, I expected a lot of turbulence,'' said <PERSON> Payne </PERSON>, 37, who is an administrator at a church, and shares her apartment with her son, <PERSON> Kimani </PERSON> <PERSON> Poles </PERSON>, 14, and daughter, <PERSON> Dadizi </PERSON> <PERSON> Poles </PERSON>, 9. `` When it did n't happen, I was really grateful. I think the people here are willing to accept change now.'' The two said they give each other moral support with daily phone calls. Yet the only disturbing incident for both came when teen-agers once yelled racial slurs outside their apartments. They said it occurred just once. <PERSON> Clinkscales </PERSON>' daughter, <PERSON> Anjanette </PERSON>, said she and her mother exchanged Christmas gifts with the <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> family next door and counts 18-year-old <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> as a friend. `` I was surprised at how nice they were,'' said <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>, who said she had never known a black family until the <PERSON> Clinkscales </PERSON> moved in.

<HEAD>Four Arrested in Stock-Trading Scandal That Has Shaken Gov't</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The founder of <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and three other businessmen were arrested today in a stock-trading scandal that has shaken <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s governing party and contributed to its loss in a special parliamentary election. The country's largest opposition party, victorious in Sunday's by-election, demanded today that Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> resign or dissolve parliament `` so the people can express their will'' about the Recruit scandal <PERSON> Takako </PERSON> <PERSON> Doi </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, told parliament her party's victory in the election in <LOCATION> Fukuoka </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> showed that public has lost faith in the corruption-tainted <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> adminstration. The balloting was widely seen as a test of the damage done by the scandal. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> refused to dissolve the legislature, which would mean calling new elections for its lower house. Recruit reportedly sold tens of thousands of unlisted shares of stock at bargain prices to politicians, their aides and other prominent people. The purchasers then profited when the stocks were publicly traded and skyrocketed in value. The scandal has also involved direct political donations by Recruit. Prosecutors said they today arrested <PERSON> Hiromasa </PERSON> <PERSON> Ezoe </PERSON>, founder and former chairman of the information services conglomerate. Also arrested were a vice president of a Recruit subsidiary and to former officials of <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest company. The Recruit officials were arrested on suspicion of giving bribes, the two <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> officials in connection with receiving bribes, news reports said. Prosecutors said <PERSON> Ezoe </PERSON> was taken from a hospital where he had been under treatment for exhaustion since the scandal was uncovered last summer. Three Cabinet ministers and more than a dozen other prominent politicians and businessmen have since resigned in the scandal, which has led to broader questions about political fund-raising and links between business and politics. `` The election -LRB- Sunday -RRB- showed that people in <LOCATION> Fukuoka </LOCATION> wo n't put up with any more -LRB- of <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s policies -RRB-,'' Ms. <PERSON> Doi </PERSON> told cheering opposition lawmakers today. `` Either the entire Cabinet must resign, or the prime minister must dissolve parliament so the people can express their will.'' A dissolution of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s parliament, the Diet, would force an election for the lower house, where <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has more than 300 of the 512 seats. An election is scheduled in July for half of the seats in the upper house, which can not be dissolved. In Sunday's race, Socialist <PERSON> Sadao </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuchigami </PERSON> defeated <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Kei </PERSON> <PERSON> Oma </PERSON> by 751,036 to 564,301 votes. The special election was called after the incumbent <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> lawmaker died in December. The election was the first for a national office since the Recruit scandal came to light last summer and the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> pushed a controversial 3 percent sales tax through parliament in December. The unpopular tax, which takes effect in April, reduces <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s heavy reliance on direct taxes by cutting corporate and upper-level income taxes The voting was seen as an indicator of what might happen in the July upper house elections. Severe setbacks in the July elections could endanger <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s chances next October to win another two-year term as party president and prime minister. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said he would undertake political reform to restore the people's trust in politics. `` I will stake everything on political reform. I will carry it out tenaciously and patiently without considering a dissolution -LRB- of parliament -RRB- or a resignation of the Cabinet,'' he told parliament. Ms. <PERSON> Doi </PERSON> called for a ban on corporate political contributions and added: `` Instead of political reform, let's have political ethics.'' The Recruit scandal erupted when it was disclosed that <PERSON> Ezoe </PERSON> sold unlisted shares in a real estate subsidiary more than 150 influential politicians, bureacrats and journalists before public trading in the shares began. The share prices then rose sharply in value and some of the purchasers made more than $ 80,000 in tax-free profits. Although the sales were not illegal in themselves, they raised questions of possible bribery and influence-peddling.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> pioneer who helped develop the rocket that took men to the moon says he was `` very dumb'' to renounce his <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizenship rather than fight charges that he committed war crimes in <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON>, 82, is seeking a temporary visa so he can attend an Apollo space program reunion at the <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> Space and Rocket Center in <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION>. He was project manager of the Apollo Saturn 5 rocket. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> accused <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> of playing a role in the deaths of thousands of concentration camp prisoners during World War II, charges he denies. `` I did not have the financial resources to go through a lengthy court trial and I did not know if after 40 years I could still find any witnesses to rebut the charges against me,'' he said in an interview last week with The <ORGANIZATION> Birmingham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> at his home outside <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> renounced his <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> citizenship at <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION>'s American consulate in May 1984 after agreeing to return to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> following a series of interviews with the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Office of Special Investigations He called that decision `` dumb, very dumb,'' the newspaper reported Sunday. <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> regained his West German citizenship last year after a lengthy West German investigation concluded he had committed no war crimes. As a member of <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Braun </PERSON> rocket team during World War II and a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> was in charge of production of the V-2 missile in the underground <LOCATION> Mittelwerk </LOCATION> factory about 140 miles south of <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION>. The area is now part of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said thousands of concentration camp prisoners were worked to death or executed at <LOCATION> Mittelwerk </LOCATION>. It charged that <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> influenced what happened there. <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON>, who was living in retirement in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> when the charges were made, said he `` never pleaded guilty but they talk anyway about alleged things that I did, not proven, and I'm not guilty.'' <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Haeussermann </PERSON>, who worked with <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> in <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and again in development of <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> rockets at <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION>, said the campaign for restoration of <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizenship would continue, but that efforts would focus now on his request for a temporary visa. `` We think the fight for -LRB- <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON>'s -RRB- exoneration may take longer and we would like to get permission for him to visit here even temporarily to be part of the reunion _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> owes him that,'' <PERSON> Haeussermann </PERSON> said. In exchange for <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON>'s agreement to leave rather than fight the accusations, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> agreed not to challenge the American citizenship of his wife, <PERSON> Martha </PERSON>, who lives with him in <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION>, or his daughter, <PERSON> Marianne </PERSON>, who works for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> also was allowed to keep his <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> pension and medical insurance coverage.

<HEAD>Maryland Legislature Rethinking Confidentiality Privileges For Pedophiles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANE E. ALLEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Legislators are having second thoughts about a unique law that grants confidentiality to pedophiles who confess to psychiatrists. Although the legislature removed some privileges last year, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> remains the only state that grants patient-doctor privilege if the pedophile discloses sexual abuse of children, or even simple child abuse, that occurred before seeking treatment from a psychiatrist who specializes in treating pedophilia. Dr. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Berlin </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sexual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disorders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION>, said in a recent interview that if he were required by law to report a pedophile's past, that person probably would n't come forward for treatment. He and others in his specialty won special confidentiality privileges from the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 to encourage pedophiles to get help. Now, the lawmakers want to force psychiatrists to report instances of past abuse that a pedophile reveals at any time _ even at his initial psychiatric evaluation. Child advocates and social services officials backing the bill maintain it's more important to protect a child's rights than to guarantee any privacy to the offender. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Comstock-Gay </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>'s executive director, said the bill presents `` an interesting privacy issue.'' The state <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> has yet to take a final position on the proposed change, which passed the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> last month. The House has yet to schedule debate on the bill. `` There's always a balance between individual rights and another interest in the public safety and public health,'' <PERSON> Comstock-Gay </PERSON> said. `` I'm sure on the surface, it must seem it's good for children to report -LRB- the abuse -RRB-, and bad not to,'' said <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, who believes more abuse may be uncovered by encouraging pedophiles to enter treatment. Noting that clergymen who counsel pedophiles and lawyers who refer them to psychiatrists for treatment are not compelled by law to report them, he added: `` My concern is that people who otherwise might have come forward would be deterred from doing so.'' For example, without the assurance of confidentiality, one of his patients, an attorney involved sexually with his daughter, never would have sought help, nor would therapists necessarily have gotten his daughter into counseling, <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> said. `` There's no way he wanted to risk being disbarred. He very much wanted treatment,'' <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> said. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resource </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advocacy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, believes some abuse could remain hidden by such privileged communications `` It concerns me that the balance with that sort of law tips toward protection of the offender,'' said <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON>. `` What about the rights of all of his victims?'' State Sen. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, who introduced the bill to strip the reporting exemption, subscribes to the once-a-pedophile, always-a-pedophile school of thought. `` Everybody admits they -LRB- pedophiles -RRB- ca n't be cured,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` I am of the opinion that they ca n't even be treated. I'd rather see them in jail, that's where they belong. However, <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> believes his program of intensive psychotherapy, in tandem sometimes with hormone treatments, can curb pedophilia. He also said that when a patient appears to be a danger to others, he wo n't hesitate to commit him to a hospital ward for sex offenders. `` It's so easy to be in the corner where you seem to be against kids, or victims. When things get pigeon-holed, it puts pressure on legislators, and it certainly makes it uncomfortable for me,'' <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> said. `` I do n't think there's a cure, but I do believe people, with help, can control themselves appropriately. It's like alcoholism; today we have the <ORGANIZATION> Betty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION>.''

 Thousands of Iranian emigres marking the 10th anniversary of the Islamic revolution shouted `` Death to <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'' and cheered as the <PERSON> shah </PERSON>'s son's called for restoration of the Peacock Throne. `` This is the day to honor the memory of all our compatriots who lost their lives in war, in prisons and in the torture chambers of this bloodthirsty regime,'' Prince <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON> told the crowd of about 12,000. The rally inside the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sports </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arena </ORGANIZATION> came a day after a massive demonstration in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, where up to 4 million people celebrated <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s leadership, who overthrew the U.S.-backed <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON>, and chanted `` Death to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' The pro-shah rally was staged in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> because the city has the largest Iranian population outside <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, with an estimated 500,000 expatriates living here. Several thousand Iranians marched through central <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on Saturday to support the prince's restoration Iranian businessmen handed out free tickets to the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> rally. Those entering were frisked by police after passing through metal detectors. Thousands waved green, white and red flags flags bearing the symbol of the shah's regime, stomped their feet, clapped and chanted anti-Khomeini slogans. <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON>, 28, took the stage to thunderous applause, holding his hands over his head in fists, blowing kisses and tossing roses into the crowd. He said <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s regime has `` spilled the blood of hundreds of thousands of Iranians,'' and `` caused the wholesale destruction of the country.'' He said all Iranians should come together and work to return the royal family to power. `` It is time for our intellectuals, our youth, our talented and experienced compatriots who have been forced into exile ... to enter the stage of history, to lead and organize, to encourage cooperation while respecting diversity of tastes and ideology,'' he said. <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON> said the end of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> presents an ideal opportunity for Iranians to unite. `` The war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> had kept our collective attention focused on an external enemy. With the end of war, the bankruptcy of the regime is ever more evident,'' <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON> conducted his entire 40-minute speech in <LOCATION> Farsi </LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> is back in the political arena after a six-year absence, promising as state <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> chairman to combine old-fashioned organizing and modern electronic marketing to expand party ranks. The 50-year-old former governor and two-time candidate for the Democratic nomination for president won his first election in more than a decade by defeating investment banker <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Westly </PERSON>, a longtime volunteer unknown outside of party circles, by 1,591 votes to 777 at the state party's annual convention Saturday night. `` It feels very good. It feels great. It's been six years, but it feels like six months,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said as he ended the self-imposed political exile that followed his loss to Republican <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> in the 1982 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> race. The vote for the previously obscure unpaid post of party chair was <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s first election victory since he won his second term as governor in 1978. He lost a series of presidential primaries in 1980 and then was defeated for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1982. He said he hopes to run for other, unspecified offices, but not during his current four-year term. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said he is seriously devoted to `` the nuts and bolts of party work,'' and he set an agenda that included redefining Democratic constituencies, reviving the local <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> clubs that thrived in the 1950s and utilizing computer and telephone marketing strategies of the 1990s. `` It's my objective to build a party that links together the elected officials and the grassroots activists,'' he said. `` We have to energize and mobilize that party of non-voters, who are our natural clientele. Many are low-income voters who have not had a strong connection with the voting process,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` At the same time ... we have to reach out to the suburban voter and those who have been tending in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> era to go against our candidates.'' <PERSON> Westly </PERSON> argued that <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> would be `` a lightning rod for political criticism,'' breathing new life into Republican attacks against controversial events of <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s tenure as governor, such as his appointment of unpopular former Chief Justice Rose Bird. Other critics said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s notoriously chaotic administrative style did n't suit the detail-oriented duties of a state chairman, and they questioned <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s new interest in a formal party structure that he shunned when he was governor. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> acknowledged those criticisms, alternately joking about his reputation and seriously promising that he has reflected on his successes and failure during the six years he has spent out of the public eye writing, meditating and traveling around the world. `` I can become the media dark hole that absorbs all the negative feedback and allows our candidate for governor to go on to victory unscathed,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> told the convention in an acceptance speech.

 The dollar rose in quiet European trading this morning and gold prices fell. One currency trader at a major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commercial bank in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, said the dollar received considerable support from Friday's release of statistics showing a large-than-expected 1 percent increase in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> producer prices in January The figures boosted expectations that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> will soon raise interest rates, a move which would reinforce the dollar, the trader said.

In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar rose 0.65 yen to a closing 128.30.

<HEAD>Anti-Apartheid Church Leader Joins Detainees' Hunger Strike</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Rev. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON>, a prominent anti-apartheid leader, said today he has begun an indefinite fast in solidarity with black detainees staging a hunger strike to demand their freedom. `` None of us wish to die,'' <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON> said in a letter to Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON>. `` But if this is the road we must take to make you and your government understand the evil of your ways, we will take it.'' Nearly 300 detainees held without charge are participating in the hunger strike, including some who have not eaten for three weeks. Thirteen reportedly have been hospitalized. Police headquarters said today that news articles about the physical condition of the hunger strikers might violate state-of-emergency regulations, which prohibit unauthorized reports about the status of detainees, unrest, security force actions and a broad range of statements the government considers subversive. Police also have banned any public meetings intended to show support for the hunger strikers. But <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON>, a mixed-race minister who is president of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reformed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, said he planned to hold a solidarity church service this week. The hunger strikers, who demand to be freed or charged, include 105 detainees at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Albans </LOCATION> prison in <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elizabeth </LOCATION> and about 170 at Diepkloof Prison outside <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. Some have been held without charge since the state of emergency was declared in June 1986. <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON> released a copy of a letter he has written to <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> explaining his decision to fast in support of the hunger strikers. `` Their action is a dramatic one which could have fateful consequences for all of us in this country,'' said <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON>, 43, who was detained for three weeks in 1985 for anti-apartheid activities. `` It is in itself an extraordinary indictment of your government, most especially your system of detention without trial.'' `` Fasting until death is not part of my religious or ecclesiastical tradition,'' <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON> said. `` But I can not stand idly by and watch those are struggling for justice in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> starve themselves to death ... I now know what God wants me to do.'' <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON> said: `` I know first hand of the pain and uncertainty of the terror of solitary confinement and the unspeakable indignity and fear it brings. He called on other South Africans to join the hunger strike. The South African Council of Churches, to which <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON> is affiliated, issued a statement today urging the release of all detainees and saying ministers should be allowed to visit the hunger strikers. On Sunday, relatives of the St. Albans strikers held an emotional church service in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brighton </LOCATION>, a black township adjoining <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elizabeth </LOCATION>, to support the demands for freedom. Under apartheid, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

 An airline ticket agent at piled up 1.7 million bonus air miles via computer without leaving the ground, then sold the credits for more than $ 20,000, according to a published report. <PERSON> Ralf </PERSON> <PERSON> Kwaschni </PERSON>, 28, was arrested Sunday when he arrived for work at Kennedy International Airport and was charged with computer tampering and grand larceny, authorities said. <PERSON> Kwaschni </PERSON>, a ticket agent for <ORGANIZATION> Lufthansa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, used to work for <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported today.

All 18 accounts, five in <LOCATION> Kwaschni </LOCATION>'s name and 13 under fake ones, listed the same post office box, according to the newspaper. Instead of exchanging the bonus miles for all the free travel, <PERSON> Kwaschni </PERSON> sold some of them for $ 22,500 to brokers, who used the credits to get a couple of first-class, round-trip tickets from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, two more between <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION> and one between <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, the newspaper said. It is legitimate to sell personal bonus miles to brokers, <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> Detective <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kwaschni </PERSON> would create accounts under common last names, the newspaper said. When a person with one of the names was aboard an American flight and did not have an advantage account, the passenger's name would be eliminated from the flight list and replaced with one from the fake accounts, the newspaper said. `` As the plane was pulling away from the gate, this guy was at the computer, literally wiping out passengers,'' <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Case Involving Abortion on Comatose Woman Expands Legal Perspectives</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAT MILTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANHASSET, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An abortion on a comatose woman has not ended the legal debate that began when her husband sought court permission to arrange the operation he hopes will help his wife's recovery The abortion was performed Saturday on 32-year-old <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> after <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> refused to issue a stay sought by anti-abortion activists. Emotions ran high on both sides throughout the more than two-week debate. `` It's been a major battle. I am tired and wounded. I want to go on with my life,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> after the abortion at <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> that ended his wife's 18-week pregnancy. He began court proceedings Jan. 26 to become his wife's guardian so he could order an abortion, which doctors said offered Mrs. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> the best hope of recovery from severe brain damage suffered in a Dec. 13 car accident. `` We are extremely relieved that the court battle is over and the operation went smoothly,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Zusselman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Delray </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> `` Now we are hopeful that <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>'s condition will improve and that we can move on to therapy for her.'' Meanwhile, anti-abortion activist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Short </PERSON> vowed to press the appeal with the full <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to set a precedent so similar cases would not occur. Short and other activists had found doctors who said having the baby would not have affected Mrs. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>'s condition any more than having an abortion But a state appeals court ruling may have dealt a blow to opponents who have attempted to intervene in cases where they apparently have no clear-cut interest legally, some lawyers said. `` One of the important aspects of this case is that it is the first time a court has squarely said to these pro-life groups: It is inappropriate to interfere in the private decisions of a family,'' said <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON>, an assistant state attorney general whose office was called in to participate in the proceedings. The Appellate Division of the State of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> called Short and <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON> `` absolute strangers'' who, `` whatever their motivation, have no place in the midst of a family tragedy.'' `` This case has marked a slight departure from previous existing law that stated that fathers do not have the right to determine whether a woman should have an abortion,'' said <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Auria </PERSON>, an attorney for North Shore. On Sunday, Mrs. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> remained in guarded condition and all signs were stable, said a hospital spokesman. Her family is considering moving her to rehabilitation facilities in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, near where <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>'s sister lives, or in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. One of the reasons <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> sought the abortion, he said, is that some facilities would not accept his wife if she were pregnant. `` I could n't bear to be that far away from <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 Former President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> says there is `` no such thing as an average day'' since he left the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and began work on memoirs, speeches and post-presidential politicking. `` We're glad to be home with our family and friends and are enjoying getting back to a more normal life _ for example, going to church on Sundays,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in answering written questions for the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION>. A story about his responses was published in today's editions of the newspaper. `` In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, it had been decided our going to church represented a threat to too many people in these times of terrorism,'' he said. The Reagans were applauded when they showed up at <LOCATION> Bel-Air </LOCATION> Presbyterian Church the weekend after returning to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and their new <LOCATION> Bel-Air </LOCATION> home after he left office last month. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, 78, keeps an office atop a <LOCATION> Century </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> skyscraper, where he works on speeches, for which he'll be paid $ 50,000 each, believed to be the highest fee in the country. He also is compiling a book of speeches to be published by <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Schuster </PERSON> and is to write his memoirs for the same publisher. Contrary to earlier reports that suggested a ghost writer would be employed, the former president insisted he will do the work himself. `` I always intended to write my memoirs,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` because I believe the story of any presidency is best told by the president.'' Former first lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is nearing completion of her memoirs, due to be published in the fall. `` There is really no such thing as an average day for either of us,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` Lunch is soup or a sandwich at my desk, and then back to work.'' The former president said most days at the new office begin with a meeting with his staff of 12, most of them former White House aides. He spends six to seven hours a day with meetings and writing. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s schedule is also busy, including appearances for the anti-drug campaign she began in the White House. A drug treatment center bearing her name is planned for the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. Like his wife, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has named some issues, including abolishing the two-term limit on the presidency, he will address in his post-White House years. `` My change of address has not diminished my interest in these issues,'' he said.

 A teen-ager, apparently angry at being turned away from a `` Sweet 16'' party, opened fire on 40 people standing on a <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> subway platform, wounding six people, police said.

The attacker fled and no arrests were made.

About 10 minutes after they went up the block, I heard gunshots.''

<TEXT>
 Soviet Jews celebrated a measure of religious freedom with the opening of the first Jewish community center in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 50 years. Soviet Jews and Jewish leaders from 70 nations filled the building in downtown <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Sunday for the opening. <PERSON> Elie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiesel </PERSON>, an author and winner of the 1986 Nobel Peace Prize, said the reforms of President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> made the center possible. `` Today is a time to say ` thank you,''' <PERSON> Wiesel </PERSON> said. `` I think he deserves our trust.'' The opening of the <ORGANIZATION> Solomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mikhoels </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, named after a Soviet Jewish actor who died in the Stalinist oppression in 1948, represents a significant change in relations between the government and the country's 1.8 million Jews. It came just a few days after a Soviet newspaper made a major admission: that Soviet Jews have suffered discrimination for decades and that dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> destroyed Jewish culture in the country. The center is in the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Jewish Musical Theater on <LOCATION> Taganka </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> in the southeastern section of the capital. For Jews, greater tolerance by the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> has meant a rise in emigration _ including an eight-year high of 20,000 in 1988 _ less harassment at Jewish holiday celebrations and the opening of a private Jewish museum and library in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. World Jewish Congress President <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON> also praised <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, saying his reforms made it possible to `` hope for a great revival of Jewish culture and religion in the U.S.S.R.'' But he added it will be some years before Soviet Jews overcome their fear of religious repression in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, where the teaching of Hebrew was once outlawed. He also expressed worry that the cultural center could become the target of anti-Semitism. <PERSON> Wiesel </PERSON> said he still hopes `` to see in history books a recognition that the main victims of <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> were Jewish _ because they were Jewish, not because they were Communists and Russian citizens.'' Sunday's ceremony drew Jewish leaders from around the world, including former Soviet refusenik <PERSON> Yuli </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelstein </PERSON>, now an executive of the Soviet Jewry Zionist Forum in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> vice president <PERSON> Isi </PERSON> <PERSON> Leibler </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>; and Rabbi <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hier </PERSON>, dean of the <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wiesenthal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The cultural center is particularly important because decades of repression have left most of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s Jews with virtually no knowledge of their religion, history and culture. `` Soviet Jews are not really Jews,'' said <PERSON> Edelstein </PERSON>, who served three years in prison for teaching Hebrew. The cultural center opened with a photo exhibit on the Holocaust. Organizers hope to offer classes in Yiddish and Hebrew, films, exhibits, music and a cafe featuring Jewish food, said director <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gluz </PERSON>. The ambassadors of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> also spoke at the ceremony. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, which does not have diplomatic relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> but which has had warmer contacts with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in recent months, sent <PERSON> Arie </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, head of its consular mission in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>.

 An 11-year-old boy who fell through ice on the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and was submerged for about 30 minutes could survive the ordeal, according to doctors. <PERSON> Deon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION> was listed in critical condition today at Children's Medical Center. Doctors said he began breathing again after rescuers pulled him from the icy water just north of downtown Sunday afternoon. `` We believe he was under about 30 minutes,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Donnini </PERSON>, who treated the boy before he was tranferred to Children's Medical Center `` He does have a pulse and he is starting to respond. He does have a chance.'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> fell through the ice sometime after 1:30 p.m. Sunday, according to <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION> police. Two other children who were with him ran to get help, and fire department divers used extension ladders laid over the ice to rescue <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who was about 50 feet from shore, authorities said. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> `` was face down in the water,'' said firefighter <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourquin </PERSON>. `` His jacket was making him float a little bit.'' Officials said the cold water, which can reduce many body functions and thus limit the need for oxygen, gives the boy a better chance. District Fire Chief <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunham </PERSON> estimated the boy had been under water 20 to 30 minutes and appeared to not be breathing when placed in the amblance. `` This is one we can save. If he has n't been in there too long, we can save him,'' <PERSON> Dunham </PERSON> said. `` We got to him quick and we had the right people with the right training there.'' <PERSON> Donnini </PERSON> said the boy's body temperature had dropped to 80 by the time he arrived at the hospital.

<HEAD>Study Of Miami Police Shootings Since 1983 Focuses on Racial Patterns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A survey of police shootings in <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> has shown the percentage of black suspects shot by police is similar to the percentage of blacks arrested, but both figures are more than double the percentage of blacks living in the county. The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday that during the past five years, 46 percent of the people shot by police in <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> have been black _ although blacks make up only 21 percent of the county's population But 44 percent of those arrested have been black, nearly identical to the percentage of those shot. The paper gathered information on 158 police shootings, including 65 that were fatal, from the state attorney's office, the Dade medical examiner's office and the 18 police departments and federal agencies that had officers involved in shootings since 1983. The shooting death of an unarmed black motorcyclist by a Colombian-born policeman led to three days of civil unrest in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> last month. Deaths of blacks at the hands of policemen have caused two other civil disturbances during the 1980s. Officials said the statistics showed no significant evidence of a pattern of bias among <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> law enforcement officers of any ethnic background. `` We reviewed it about two to three years ago and reached the same conclusion,'' said Dade State Attorney <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>. `` If there is any indication of a pattern, we will look at it again.'' `` We do n't contest all shootings,'' said <PERSON> Aleem </PERSON> <PERSON> Fakir </PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> To </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lead </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Struggle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> For </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equality </ORGANIZATION>, a group of black church and civic leaders critical of police treatment of blacks. But <PERSON> Fakir </PERSON> said that seldom do `` whites get shot under cloudy circumstances.'' The analysis found no unusual racial pattern among the officers involved in shooting incidents, either. Countywide, 9 percent of the police shootings were done by black officers, 29 percent were by Latin officers and 49 percent by <ORGANIZATION> Anglo </ORGANIZATION> officers. That ratio generally reflects the ethnic makeup of the county's combined law enforcement departments. The other 13 percent of cases involved two or more officers of different ethnic backgrounds. `` I think most police shootings are colorblind,'' said <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> Police Chief <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, who is black. `` The shooting is precipitated by an unlawful violation. It may be related to drugs or robbery or burglary. You ca n't say there is prejudice.''

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> went before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last week and advocated statehood for an unrepresented region of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> where residents have no right `` to determine their political power.'' Some people in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> sat on the edge of their seats, expecting that at long last their stateless city would get presidential recognition. But, no. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed statehood for <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, not <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> D.C </ORGANIZATION>. He asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, in his budget speech last Thursday, to authorize a statehood referendum in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. `` Insulting,'' said <PERSON> Hilda </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> the next day. She is a member of the city council of the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, representing the <ORGANIZATION> Statehood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. But some local statehood advocates took heart from the paragraph in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s speech. They saw a solution to their long dilemma: the joint admission of both could send Republicans to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> while the District would be almost certain to elect Democrats. If <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is pushing for Puerto Rican statehood _ as <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> once did _ he must be sure it would turn out to be Republican turf, they said. `` I think it has the makings of a deal,'' said activist <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Plotkin </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> D.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Just such a deal brought <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> into the union in 1959, said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>, a local minister who represents Washingtonians in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> as a non-voting delegate. Except something went awry, he said. <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> was expected to elect Republicans to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> to elect Democrats. It turns out that <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>'s two senators are Democrats and <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s are Republican. <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has been kept out of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> because of `` the four toos'' _ the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> is `` too urban, too progressive, too Democratic and, for some people, too black.'' `` I put the racial thing at the bottom,'' says <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>, who is black. `` At the top is that we're too Democratic. And the fact is that a rural state would not want to see two more urban senators. And conservatives do n't want progressive. What President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said signals to me that there may be hope of bipartisan cooperation.'' `` Race is a major factor,'' disagreed <PERSON> Plotkin </PERSON>, who is white. `` It provides an excuse to deny full citizenship to people who are not white.'' The District _ with a population larger than those of <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> _ is overwhelmingly black. On the surface, the timing could hardly be less favorable for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to make its case. The mayor, <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, is the subject of two investigations into his social ties with people undergoing drug investigations. The city set a record for homicides last year, with 372, surpassing <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s rate. <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>'s own hiring practices are being investigated for possible payroll padding, according to congressional and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> sources. Moreover, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, after granting home rule for the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> in 1973, took some of it back last year. To a bill authorizing $ 3.2 billion to the city to cover the cost of the federal presence, it attached a rider requiring the city to stop using Medicaid money to pay for abortions. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> also overrode the city council and said <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> could deny facilities to homosexual campus groups. And <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> compelled the city to repeal a law barring insurance companies from requiring AIDS tests of applicants for life insurance. `` If the District had none of these problems, we would still have the partisan political reality that it is not in the interests of conservative Republicans to see the District become a state,'' said <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Plotkin </PERSON> disagreed: `` The political reality is that the problems presented by the mayor and Delegate <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON> provide a ready-made excuse to block any action.'' Meanwhile, there's evidence suggesting Puerto Ricans may not want to be dealt in. In a plebiscite on the island in 1967, 60 percent of those who voted favored continued commonwealth status under which they are <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens but pay no federal taxes and ca n't vote in presidential elections. Statehood was favored by 39 percent and 1 percent voted for independence. The District voted for statehood in 1981, adopted the name `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>'' for the would-be state and wrote a state constitution that was so liberal it became an impediment to the goal. Its case has n't budged in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> since.

 An explosion killed a Palestinian in the occupied territories today, and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops critically wounded two Arab teen-agers during a stone-throwing riot, the army said. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, two left-wing members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> said recent attacks by Israelis on Palestinians in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> are the work of a `` very efficient and well armed'' Jewish settler militia. The army imposed a curfew on <LOCATION> Kabatiya </LOCATION> village in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> after an unidentified man accidentally blew himself up in an blast that hurt two other villagers, a military spokesman said. `` A preliminary report indicates they found a suspicious object, played with it and it exploded,'' said a military statement. An Arab reporter in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> said a 4-year-old girl and her 10-year-old brother were seriously hurt while herding sheep near their Tayasir village home. The children's parents said they heard an explosion, but do not know its cause. It was not immediately clear whether the army and the <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reporter described the same incident. Tayasir and <LOCATION> Kabatiya </LOCATION> are 10 miles apart. A military spokesman denied the man was killed inside <LOCATION> Kabatiya </LOCATION>, but refused to elaborate. At least six other children have been reported wounded in similar mysterious blasts, which the government is investigating. <PERSON> Ehud </PERSON> <PERSON> Barak </PERSON>, deputy chief of staff of the armed forces, has said some injuries were caused by flares emitted by fighter jets to deflect heat-seeking missiles. A few flares fall to earth instead of exploding, he said. In the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Rafah </LOCATION> refugee camp today, two 14-year-olds were shot in the head by troops. They were in critical condition in Israeli hospitals, a military spokeswoman said. Two <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> legislators from the left-wing <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> sent a letter to Attorney General <PERSON> Yosef </PERSON> <PERSON> Harish </PERSON> charging there is a well-organized militia of several hundred settlers armed with automatic weapons, vehicles and advanced communications sytems. Settler leaders denied an organized militia exists. The lawmakers' letter was sent Sunday after 40 settlers stormed into a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> mayor's office to protest stonings and firebombings of settlers' cars. The army spirited Mayor <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sneineh </PERSON> out of his <LOCATION> Qalqilya </LOCATION> office and forced the settlers to leave. `` We are calling on the attorney general to break up this militia,'' said <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarid </PERSON>, who authored the letter with <PERSON> Dedi </PERSON> <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sarid </PERSON> said bands of settler vigilante groups started forming a few months ago in response to <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> attacks on some of the 70,000 Jewish settlers who uneasily share the occupied lands with 1.7 million Arabs. Settlers formed the militia because they have lost faith in the army's ability to protect them, <PERSON> Sarid </PERSON> said. Settler leader <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Nachman </PERSON>, named in the letter as a key militia chief, said the paramilitary organization was <PERSON> Sarid </PERSON>'s `` fantasy.'' `` There is a difference between a militia and people getting fed up and doing something,'' said <PERSON> Nachman </PERSON>, mayor of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> settlement of Ariel. However, he added that if the government does not take harsher measures to end the 14-month Palestinian uprising, such as deporting <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leaders, more settler violence is likely. The settlers were protesting the death Wednesday of a 37-year-old Jewish taxi driver from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> settlement of <PERSON> Alfe </PERSON> <PERSON> Menashe </PERSON>. Police said <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Jerassi </PERSON> apparently was attacked by <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON>, but they have not discovered what caused his car to burst into flames as he drove past <LOCATION> Qalqilya </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jerassi </PERSON>'s death would raise to 16 the number of Israelis who have died in the Palestinian uprising. At least 380 Palestinians have been killed in the revolt against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s occupation of lands seized in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war.

 Protestant vigilantes said today they killed a Roman Catholic lawyer in his home, and Irish nationalists accused a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> government minister of making remarks that endangered lawyers. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Finucane </PERSON> was slain Sunday by three men who stormed his home in north <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. His wife <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> was wounded in the ankle by a bullet and was hospitalized in satisfactory condition. <PERSON> Finucane </PERSON> had acted for clients involved in the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s campaign against British rule. The outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fighters </ORGANIZATION> telephoned a coded message to the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> today claiming responsibility for the attack. Press Association, the British domestic news agency, said <PERSON> Finucane </PERSON> was the first attorney killed by extremists in 20 years of sectarian violence. <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s legal political arm, <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, said junior Home Office minister <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogg </PERSON> provided the `` pretext for the slaying of Mr. <PERSON> Finucane </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Hogg </PERSON> told a parliamentary committee discussing an anti-terrorist bill that certain <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> lawyers were `` unduly sympathetic'' to paramilitary organizations. His remarks were raised in the House of Commons on Jan. 31. <PERSON> Seamus </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallon </PERSON>, deputy leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said he had warned <PERSON> Hogg </PERSON> that his words could compromise the safety of lawyers in the province. `` I warned him at the time that that was a very dangerous statement. I warned him that as a consequence, some lawyers in the north of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> could become targets for assassins' bullets and, tragically, those words have proved prophetically true,'' <PERSON> Mallon </PERSON> said in a radio interview. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ireland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION> called for <PERSON> Hogg </PERSON>'s resignation, accusing him of making lawyers targets. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>, spokesman on <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> for the Labor opposition, said: `` I think Mr. <PERSON> Hogg </PERSON> has got to consider very carefully what he said. This death must be a tragedy for the legal profession in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> as well as for the family of the deceased.'' <PERSON> Finucane </PERSON>, 38, was involved in the <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armagh </LOCATION> inquest into the 1983 police killings of three unarmed <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas. The families of the guerrillas claimed the men were victims of an alleged police `` shoot to kill'' campaign against Irish nationalists. The inquest was abandoned after <PERSON> Finucane </PERSON>, acting for the family of one of the dead, went to the High Court demanding that three policemen involved in the shooting be forced to attend and give evidence at the hearing. The coroner had initially directed that the policemen need not attend but only submit statements. <PERSON> Finucane </PERSON> eventually won his case, but on appeal by the authorities the inquest was adjourned indefinitely. <PERSON> Finucane </PERSON> succeeded in having charges dropped against a man in connection with the killing of two soldiers at an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> funeral last year. The predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to push the British out of this Protestant-dominated province and unite it with the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>.

 Moslem students marched in several cities today to denounce the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because of a book they consider blasphemous and to protest the killing of five people in rioting Sunday. Hundreds of police stood guard in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> near the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, which nearly 3,000 Moslem fundamentalists stormed Sunday. Five people were shot to death, 83 people were injured and at least 65 people were arrested in the three-hour melee. The militant demonstrators alleged the center's library contained the 1988 novel `` The Satanic Verses'' by <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>. Moslems say the book is blasphemous because it suggests the prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> was fallible, and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> have banned the novel. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats, who say the library does not have <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s book, ordered the information center and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy closed at mid-day today for fear of renewed violence. About 300 Moslem theology students and political opposition leaders chanted `` <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> should hang'' during a march today in <LOCATION> Rawalpindi </LOCATION>, where most stores were closed in mourning for those killed Sunday. Witnesses said small groups of young men hurled stones at shops that remained open. There were no reports of injuries. There also were demonstrations outside the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consular missions in <LOCATION> Lahore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Karachi </LOCATION>. No violence was reported. Three Americans and 15 Pakistani employees were in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> when it was attacked Sunday by protesters yelling `` God is great!'' Police repeatedly fired at the demonstrators, who hurled rocks and bricks and burned an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag. `` The staff is traumatized,'' said a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> advised Americans in the capital to exercise `` extreme caution.'' American diplomats said they were puzzled that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was singled out by the protesters, as the Indian-born <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> lives in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, where his book first was published in September. `` The embassy wishes to emphasize that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government in no way supports or associates itself with any activity that is in any sense offensive or insulting to Islam or any other religion,'' the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. Prime Minister <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, on an official visit to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, ordered an investigation of the riot. `` My heart is bleeding for Pakistanis who fell victims to the conspiracy of forces which are bent upon weakening the democratic government on the one hand and on the other hand for those who lost their lives due to an unwise administrative action,'' she was quoted as saying by the official Pakistani news agency. The official English-language newspaper, the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> Times, questioned the motive of the protesters. `` It is hard to see how -LRB- the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> -RRB- became the prime object of mob anger in the present case when both the author and the first publication of the book belonged elsewhere,'' an editorial said. The novel takes its name from the verses <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> removed from Islam's holy book, the Koran, on grounds they were inspired by Satan. The novel's protagonists are an Indian movie star and a British TV personality who fall from an airliner blown up by terrorists en route from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. They are presumed dead but survive, or are reborn, and take on the attributes of the angel <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> and Satan. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> denies his novel attacks the Islamic religion, which he says has been of central importance to him all his life. He said it deals with `` migration, metamorphosis, divided selves, love, death, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>.''

<TEXT>
 A lawyer for three black men said today his clients have told him <PERSON> Winnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> was `` involved in the events'' when they and a friend were abducted from a church home and beaten by her unofficial bodyguards. The statement by prominent anti-apartheid lawyer <PERSON> Geoff </PERSON> <PERSON> Budlender </PERSON> came one day after a newspaper reported that Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, the wife of jailed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, took part in the alleged beatings. One of the four, 14-year-old <PERSON> Stompie </PERSON> <PERSON> Seipei </PERSON>, has been missing since Jan. 1 and is feared dead. Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, 54, has denied the accusations contained in the Sunday Star, a <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> newspaper that opposes apartheid. She has implied they were fabricated to hurt her husband. Later today, an attorney who had been acting for Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, <PERSON> Krish </PERSON> <PERSON> Naidoo </PERSON>, announced that he had resigned as her representative. He did not give a reason when reached by telephone by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Howevever, The Star quoted him today as saying `` I felt it was not within the scope of my work to deal with the Mandela crisis.'' The three men, who are considering legal action, gave <PERSON> Budlender </PERSON> statements about what happened to them but have not authorized him to release details, he told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>. The men, aged 20 to 29, were released from Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s home after intervention by community leaders. <PERSON> Budlender </PERSON> said his clients `` say they were abducted ... and they were all assaulted on the first night. They say she -LRB- Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> -RRB- was involved in the events on the first night. They say <PERSON> Stompie </PERSON> was removed from them a day or two afterward and they never saw him again.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> has denied that she was at her home when the bodyguards, known as the <ORGANIZATION> Mandela </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> soccer club, brought the four there. She has said they were taken from the <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> house to protect them from sexual abuse, a charge the church said it has investigated and found false. Community leaders in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>, a black township outside <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, and officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> have accused the soccer club of abducting and beating the four last month. The Citizen, a <LOCATION> Johnannesburg </LOCATION> daily, quoted <PERSON> Zindzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> as saying her mother would hold a news conference after visiting <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, who is held at a house on a prison farm near <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. An aide in Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s office, who would not give his name, said she would hold a news conference Wednesday. <PERSON> Zindzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> was quoted as saying her mother planned to sue The Star and The Weekly Mail, an anti-apartheid newspaper that reported Friday that the body of <PERSON> Stompie </PERSON> <PERSON> Seipei </PERSON> had been found. Police have been unable to confirm that report. The <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> said one of the four escaped from Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s house and alerted community leaders meeting at a nearby Methodist church. A well-known anti-apartheid physician, Dr. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Asvat </PERSON>, went to the house, saw the beaten males `` and warned that <PERSON> Stompie </PERSON> had been so badly assaulted that he would not live,'' the newspaper said. The next day, <PERSON> Asvat </PERSON> was slain at his Soweto clinic by two young men pretending to be patients. Police are investigating the killing to determine if it was linked to the Mandela controversy. Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> has denied any wrongdoing and rejected reports of discord with her husband, the most popular leader among <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s disenfranchised black majority. She told <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> last week that no <ORGANIZATION> Mandela </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> members were involved in <PERSON> Stompie </PERSON>'s disappearance. She was quoted Sunday by <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, a black-oriented newspaper, as acknowledging that the four had been taken to her home but saying she was not present. City Press quoted <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, who describes himself as <ORGANIZATION> Mandela </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s former coach, as saying he had beaten the men and boy to make them admit that they had been sexually molested by a white Methodist minister. The president of the <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, the Rev. <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Mogoba </PERSON>, said the allegations of sexual abuse against the Rev. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Verryn </PERSON> were fabricated. The exiled leadership of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has urged Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> to disband <ORGANIZATION> Mandela </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>. She says the team has been disbanded but that about eight young men continue to live at her house. Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> has appointed a senior police commander to investigate. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, jailed since 1962, is serving a life sentence for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the white minority government.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has endorsed a multiparty system for the first time, but says the change must be gradual and orderly. The party's policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> announced its new position over the weekend after a two-day meeting during which it also revised its view of the 1956 anti-Soviet uprising. Allowing more than one political party would provide a `` better safeguard'' against abuse of power, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday in a communique released by the state news agecy <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION>. It also said `` danger exists for the process to become destabilized and uncontrollable. That is not in the interest of any force with a sense of responsibility.'' In a half-hour interview broadcast on radio and television Sunday evening, party leader <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> said alternative parties could exist `` only on a socialist basis.'' Parliament is expected to pass a bill by Aug. 1 that would allow alternative parties, making <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> the first <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc country to have a genuine multiparty system. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Nepszabadsag </ORGANIZATION> today published <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>'s speech at the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting, held Friday and Saturday <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> criticized the `` extremist wing'' of potential alternative parties. He said all parties would have to accept <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s membership in the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> military alliance and `` prevent any deepening'' of the nation's economic problems <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> also praised what he called `` more composed'' forces and said `` there is a realistic possibility to establish a lasting political alliance with these.'' The Soviets have not taken a public stand on recent Hungarian reforms. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> is to visit Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in March. Hungarian Politburo reformer <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON> created conflict among communists two weeks ago with a stunning re-evaluation of the anti-Soviet revolt of 1956. <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON> said the revolt was a popular uprising, not a counterrevolution as his party had called it for 32 years. His comments touched off intense public debate and led to the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting. The committee statement and <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>'s remarks on television indicated there had been a compromise on reassessing the revolt. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> said that over the years the party `` had forgotten those popular elements'' that started the uprising against the Stalinist regime of <LOCATION> Matyas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rakosi </LOCATION> on Oct. 23, 1956. But, he said, by the time the Soviets had crushed the uprising on Nov. 4, 1956, counterrevolutionary forces were leading the revolt. Western diplomats and some Hungarians active in the dozens of alternative political groups started recently said they believed the outcome of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting was a victory for <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON>, who has pushed hard for a multiparty system.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> left a dispute over short-range nuclear missiles behind in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and took his <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> tour to <LOCATION> Scandinavia </LOCATION> today hoping a solution would be worked out before his return to <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> met first today in <LOCATION> Copenhagen </LOCATION> with Danish Foreign Minister <PERSON> Uffe </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellemann-Jensen </PERSON> on a stop designed to acquaint the new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> secretary of state with <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s skittishness over nuclear weapons. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> then flew to <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, a staunch <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ally that considers itself the cornerstone of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s northern defense. In <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s leaders expressed reservations about the need to update the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> missiles Prime Minister <PERSON> Gro </PERSON> <PERSON> Harlem </PERSON> <PERSON> Brundtland </PERSON> said modernizing the Western alliance's battlefield nuclear arms was one of many issues that required more discussion. `` We believe it should be a wide agenda, including both deterrence and disarmament negotiations,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Brundtland </PERSON> told reporters, with <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> standing at her side. Norwegian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Thorvald </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> added later, `` Negotiations could lead to a result which does not make modernization necessary.'' <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON>, who will visit <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> this month, said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> did not press for modernizing the nuclear arsenal, but only was `` thinking aloud on the policy of the new administration.'' The most critical talks of <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s eight-day tour of the 15 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies are being held in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>. West German leaders are trying to delay the modernization of <LOCATION> Lance </LOCATION> battlefield nuclear missiles, while the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration wants to upgrade them. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said a statement was being prepared in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> while <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Scandinavia </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, who was returning to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> tonight, would discuss with Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, declined to say whether a compromise had been reached or the differences would papered over until the issue is addressed at a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit meeting in May. West German leaders are concerned that upgrading the missiles could threaten further progress in <LOCATION> East-West </LOCATION> disarmament talks. There is strong public opposition to modernization in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the country is to hold national elections next year. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> began talks with West German officials on Sunday after meeting with British officials in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. He has said he is not worried about <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s statement last week that the Lance missiles now deployed are adequate until 1995. Under a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> plan, the missiles' 70-mile range would be extended with new rockets that could hit targets about 320 miles away. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> is expected to make a decision on modernization in three months. On <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s agenda in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> were two other touchy issues: Western curbs on technology sales to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the help West German companies gave to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> in the construction of an alleged chemical weapons plant. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the British told him they would like to see the curbs lifted now that Soviet troops are leaving <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Concerning <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said new West German export restrictions were `` quite promising,'' as were recent pledges by the <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> government to prosecute violators. Commenting on his meetings Sunday with Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> foreign </ORGANIZATION> secretary, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> source said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> received support on many <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> issues. The source declined to elaborate. Also, the source said, <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> urged <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> to plunge into the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> situation `` to sustain the moderate course'' the foreign secretary said the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> had taken. The source said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> made it clear <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which began in December after a 13-year ban, would be continued. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s trip began Friday in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and took him to <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION> on Saturday. His last stop is <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> before returning to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Friday.

 An elderly woman and her daughter were found stabbed to death with a butcher knife in their home two weeks after another member of the family was strangled in her home across town, authorities said today. `` We have reason to believe all three slayings were related,'' said <LOCATION> Claiborne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said officers were questioning a male suspect in the slayings and that formal charges were expected later in the day. The man was not related to the victims, he said. A relative discovered the bodies of <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mae </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thomas </ORGANIZATION>, 58, and her mother, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, 88, about 6 p.m. Sunday in a bedroom of the home they shared in <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gibson </LOCATION>. `` It appeared they were both sexually molested and both had stab wounds to the chest,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. The bodies were found within an hour after the women were killed, he said. The apparent murder weapon, a butcher knife, was found at the scene, he said.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> opened a campaign for public support of his new budget today by returning to the state that propelled him to his <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> victory and declared, `` our plan is a realistic one.'' `` It is a budget plan that will work, but not with business as usual,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION>. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s budget director, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, prepared for talks with congressional leaders on the $ 1.16 trillion plan the administration unveiled last week. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> mixed words of backing for that plan _ already encountering <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> resistance in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ with a sentimental thank you to the state that almost one year ago gave him his first victory in the race for the Republican presidential nomination. `` It's no coincidence that my very first stop is here in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who came here after a weekend of relaxation at his seacoast retreat in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. His speech was the first in what aides said would be a series of talks around the country as the administration presses for agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on spending cuts. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> scored a decisive comeback win in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s Feb. 16, 1988, primary election that restored momentum that had been halted with a defeat in the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses. `` The steadfast support I received gave me the chance to pick myself up off the canvas. And the rest, as they say, is history.'' `` A year ago about this time I came to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> under quite different circumstances. I had just lost in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. I was up at 6:50 a.m., my first morning here, holding my coffee in one hand and shaking the hands of factory workers with the other. `` The columnists had begun to write my political obituary.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s speech highlighted the major features of his budget plan, which calls for restraint in defense spending with a call for increases in education, aid to the homeless, child care and environmental cleanup. However, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan has already been criticized by congressional Democratic leaders for failing to specify what programs would be cut to pay for new humanitarian initiatives. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not mention that criticism in his remarks. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> was to defend the plan in meetings with leaders of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> budget committees. `` I presented to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> a realistic plan for dealing with the federal budget,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He said his plan would `` keep faith with our promise to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people of no new taxes.'' `` There are some areas in which we would all like to spend more, but we can not until we get our fiscal house in order and bring the deficit down.'' And, as he had done in his maiden speech to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last Thursday night, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vowed `` to work day and night'' with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in coming up with a plan that meets budget targets. Despite <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s no-new-taxes pledge, Sen. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, said after the speech that there might have to be some form of tax increase next year. `` Obviously, no promise is forever,'' <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON> told reporters aboard <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> One on the way back to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. He predicted `` a good three months of heavy slugging'' on the budget fight. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he wanted to thank <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s people both for what they did for him in the past and `` to thank you for what you can do in the future.'' The president says his budget proposal will produce a fiscal 1990 deficit of $ 91.1 billion, below the $ 100 billion figure required by the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, attended services Sunday at the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congregational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> outside <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, and then the president met at his nearby home with a group of Soviet scholars. `` It was just an intellectual exercise,'' press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said of the afternoon meeting, which included national security adviser <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> and Deputy Secretary of State-designate <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON>. Similarly, <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> today described the session as `` just a bull session.'' He said the president had invited the scholars, mostly from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> universities, so he could help firm up his own views on evolving relations with the Soviets. `` It helps him get a better feel for our own experts' thinking,'' Scowcroft said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said that in the early weeks of his administration, he wants to re-evaluate U.S.-Soviet relations before embracing any new East-West diplomatic initiatives. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> last week proposed some changes in the budget that then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> submitted to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in January. Although the two versions are more similar than dissimilar, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did propose several initiatives reflecting campaign promises for expanded social programs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he wants to hold military spending increases to the rate of inflation, but so far he has not spelled where else he would make cuts to pay for these new initiatives. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said all along that he would oppose tax increases. On Sunday, <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said it would be up to congressional Democrats to suggest tax hikes. Appearing on <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Face The Nation,'' <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> insisted that more taxes are not needed to reduce the deficit. `` What would happen in a negotiation is that we are certainly not going to bring up taxes,'' he said. `` The president has made his position extremely clear. `` If the other side wants to bring up taxes, we will have to discuss that on merits. And our position is that the merits do n't require taxes. <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said that in his talks with Sen. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>, D-Tenn., and Rep. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, D-Calif., the heads of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> budget committees, `` I look forward to learning a bit more about what they're thinking of as their own possible budget

 Evangelist <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> says his television ministry will end this month unless he receives an influx of donations to overcome `` pornographers'' who are trying to knock him off the air. `` If for whatever reason this week, you close the door in my face or you pass me by, ... Feb. 26 will be the final telecast for this ministry,'' <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> said in his taped television program distributed for broadcast this past weekend. `` It's either the pornographers or us. They will have their way and eliminate <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> from television. That's what they wanted to do,'' <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> did not give any figures of how much money he needed. A guard who answered the phone Sunday said he could not contact <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, and a message left at his office this morning seeking further comment was not immediately returned. In the latest edition of Penthouse magazine, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> stripper said she performed sex acts for <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> while he watched. The allegations leveled by <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kampen </PERSON>, strongly denied by <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, were similar to those of <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphree </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> prostitute, that led to <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s ouster last year from the Assemblies of God. In a tearful confession to his congregation last February, <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> said he had sinned, but did not reveal specifics. He was defrocked by the Assemblies after refusing to stay away from the pulpit for at least one year. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> has not released any hard figures on the ministry's financial problems However, in the past year there have been layoffs at the ministries, cancellation of his weekly television show by three major cable networks, and an exodus of students from <ORGANIZATION> Jimmy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swaggart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bible </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, which many faculty members left to avoid being defrocked with <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>.

 Lovers seeking the sweetest of gifts on St. Valentine's Day would be wise to pay a visit to <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>, a chocolatier for a queen and a president who has elevated candy-making to an art. In his shop on a plain city street, pink and white candy tulips lay on sculptured chocolate bowls, thin and smooth like porcelain, hand-painted by the master. There are white chocolate swans with long slender necks, and old-fashioned red velvet hearts, as large and plush as cushions, stuffed with truffles. Chocolate Cupids float with bows drawn and hot-lip lollipops beckon for a kiss. `` My goal is to create a dream for clients, to fulfill their fantasies,'' said <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>, expressing the same childlike joy as the hero of the movie `` <PERSON> Willy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wonka </PERSON> and the Chocolate Factory.'' Like <PERSON> Wonka </PERSON>, everything <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> makes is satisfying and delicious. Talk about your childhood wishes, you can even eat the dishes. Some of <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>'s chocolate flowers and shell-like bowls are part of a touring show of confection art organized by the American Craft Museum in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> <PERSON> Confections </PERSON>, a 5-year-old love affair of <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> and partner <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, is no ordinary candy store. Its artistic and tasty creations have delighted <PERSON> Queen </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and thousands of loyal customers. <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>, who said he's `` 49 going on 30,'' once made a chocolate replica of the Eiffel Tower for the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> ambassador and a giant panda holding bamboo shoots for a <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> dinner with Prince <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON>. It is not the size of <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>'s creations, though, that make them so startling. Many of his finest works are small, with the attention to detail of miniature portraits. The petals on long-stemmed chocolate tulips are as delicately shaped as real tulips. The cost of all this effort? <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> works about four hours on each of his sculptured bowls but sells them for only $ 20. Big bonbons laced with liqueurs are $ 1 apiece. `` We give away our product because we enjoy it so much,'' said <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, who works almost as long as <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>'s 18-hour days. The two former pastry chefs and a staff of 90 people at their chocolate factory and retail shop each week turn 40,000 pounds of premium raw chocolate from <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> into treats for the sweet of tooth. All that chocolate adds up to a $ 1 million a year business, <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said. Valentine's Day, Easter and Christmas are their biggest holidays, but it seems every week is special. Even Groundhog Day earlier this month was an excuse for candied fantasies, with the cute chocolate animals springing up from the shelves. `` We've created more of an art form,'' <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said. `` That's <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>'s love He spends every night by himself creating.'' The biggest problem with <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>'s Confections is that the fragile sculptures do n't travel well. For the American Craft Museum show, which is traveling to museums around the country this year and next, a museum courier had to hand-carry <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>'s goodies on the plane. `` There is a sense of magic when you see <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>'s work,'' said <PERSON> Anthea </PERSON> <PERSON> Zonars </PERSON>, assistant curator at the American Craft Museum. `` You can go into a chocolate shop and find chocolate roses of all types. But <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>'s are remarkable. I think they're beautiful, and they make my mouth water. <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>'s sells truffles and bonbons by mail in this country and in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` If you want a sculpture, though,'' <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said, `` You have to come here and carry it very carefully.''

 Two masked gunmen sneaked into a hospital early Monday and killed a reputed crime figure in his bed, where he was recovering from an assassination attempt two days earlier, police said. Patients and hospital employees dived for cover under beds when the gunmen opened fire in the public hospital in <LOCATION> Mesagne </LOCATION>, a town of 30,000 people near <LOCATION> Brindisi </LOCATION> in the southern <LOCATION> Apulia </LOCATION> region, according to the news agency <ORGANIZATION> AGI </ORGANIZATION>. The victim, <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonica </PERSON>, 31, had been admitted Saturday night after two masked gunmen shot him outside his home. He suffered a hand wound and asked to be hospitalized for his own safety. The assassins entered the hospital at dawn, made their way to the orthopedic ward on the second floor and subdued the doctor on duty, police said. They burst into <PERSON> Antonica </PERSON>'s room, which he shared with two other patients, shot him twice in the neck and escaped in the ensuing panic, police said. Investigators said the killing apparently stemmed from a war between rival criminal gangs for control of the drug trafficking trade in the region. They said <PERSON> Antonica </PERSON> had been arrested previously on charges of criminal association.

 The priest of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michael </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> said dissident parishioners occupying his church are liars and said he wo n't respond to their demands that Polish traditions be preserved and a popular Polish priest retained. The dissidents, who number about 80 and say they have the support of 800 of the church's 1,200 parishioners, vowed Sunday to continue their occupation of the church. The Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bambol </PERSON>, the current parish priest, said the protesters have falsely accused him of forcing a popular Polish priest out of the parish. `` This is a small group of people, new immigrants,'' <PERSON> Bambol </PERSON> said. `` We are being threatened by them in the news, through telephone calls and with lies.'' <PERSON> Bambol </PERSON> said church officials have decided to ignore the occupation that began Saturday afternoon and continued this morning. `` Nothing. We're going to do nothing,'' he said. The protest has not disrupted activities in the 89-year-old church, which was packed with about 500 people during Sunday's noon Mass. Following the service, about 80 dissidents remained behind to continue the occupation. This morning, about 20 protesters sang hymns, said the rosary and prayed in Polish in the church. They said they hope to continue the protest indefinitely, staying at the church in shifts, instead of ending today as originally planned. They vowed to start a hunger strike later in the week if necessary to press their demands. The dispute centers on the pending transfer of associate pastor, the Rev. Roman Palaszewski of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, and the replacing of the Rev. <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> <PERSON> Pysz </PERSON>, who was moved to a <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, church in August. <PERSON> Halina </PERSON> <PERSON> Chmiel </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the dissidents, said <PERSON> Palaszewski </PERSON> was notified nine weeks ago that he was being transferred back to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> by the Franciscan order. She said <PERSON> Palaszewski </PERSON> was in the third year of a five-year assignment to <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michael </ORGANIZATION>'s. `` We want our priest back in the parish,'' <PERSON> Chmiel </PERSON> said. `` He kept the culture, the Polish tradition, which is important in this church. He was a people's priest.'' She accused <PERSON> Bambol </PERSON> of getting him transferred back to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> out of jealousy. `` It's a lie,'' <PERSON> Bambol </PERSON> said. `` He got orders to go and you have to go.'' Officials of the <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diocese </LOCATION> did n't respond to messages seeking comment, left with the diocese's answering service Sunday and today. In addition to the dispute over priests, some critics have said the protesters are upset that <PERSON> Bambol </PERSON> was attempting to open the parish to other ethnic groups. The parish is in a largely Hispanic neighborhood. <PERSON> Protester </PERSON> <PERSON> Genevieve </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozlowski </PERSON> said they did n't want to keep other groups out of the church but did want to keep its Polish heritage. `` What we have is Polish church. Why ca n't it stay a Polish church? We do n't care if Puerto Ricans or blacks come to pray with us. We welcome them. But we want to keep our Polish customs, traditions and language,'' she said.

<TEXT>
 The environmental group <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> petitioned the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Monday to require that milk cartons used in the nation's school-lunch programs be made of material which which wo n't put dioxin in the milk. <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> said such cartons should be required for the nearly 5 billion half-pints of milk that five of the department's programs help pay for every year. Eighty percent of that milk is used in school lunches. No studies of dioxin in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> milk have been reported by any government agency. <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> relied on a Canadian government study in its petition to the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The group said the department should require cartons of unbleached paper, returnable glass containers or any other biodegradable carton that wo n't put toxic substances in the milk. Paper milk cartons currently are made with bleached paper. Paper bleached with chlorine can contain trace amounts of dioxin, the most powerful cause of cancer ever tested in laboratory animals, and related compounds, according to industry and government findings announced two years ago. Dioxin has never been proved to cause human cancer, but in high doses it can cause a severe form of acne and recent evidence has linked it to reproductive disorders. The Canadian study and <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> calculations said that a 110-pound child drinking a single half-pint from a bleached paper carton would ingest 0.6 picograms of the equivalent of the most toxic dioxin per kilogram of body weight. This is 100 times the daily amount that the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> has estimated is likely to raise the risk of cancer by one in a million if continued for a lifetime. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has proposed a 17-fold reduction in its risk estimates for dioxin, but has not acted. If the proposed risk estimate were in effect, the 0.6 picograms per kilogram would still represent six times the amount estimated to raise the risk of cancer by one in a million. According to the Canadian study, milk from plastic and glass containers contained only a tenth as many dioxin compounds typical of the bleaching process, or none at all. All humans in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are believed to have trace amounts of dioxin in their fat. The compound binds to fatty tissue. <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Hieber </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> told a news conference the affinity of dioxin for fat helps account for finding it in milk. `` If the carton were filled with water instead of milk, chances are the dioxin would have stayed in the carton,'' she said. Although no studies of dioxin in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> milk have been reported by any government agency, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> television station, <ORGANIZATION> WJLA </ORGANIZATION>, conducted its own tests and found levels similar to those found in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Roberta </PERSON> <PERSON> Baskin </PERSON>, a reporter for <ORGANIZATION> WJLA </ORGANIZATION> at the news conference. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> did not immediately return a telephone call. <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Raulston </PERSON>, vice president for government affairs of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, the industry's major trade association, said `` there were questions about the testing procedure in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, and neither their government nor ours is relying on those results.'' The Food and Drug Administration and the industry have begun milk tests using a more sophisticated procedure and results are expected in a few months, she said, and the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> should wait for those results. `` The industry is committed to providing safe packaging and if there's anything they're uncomfortable with -LRB- at <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, we'll have to address that,'' she said.

 March 1 will be a late night for this town. Its residents _ all 16 of them _ will appear that evening as guests on the <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> show `` Late Night With <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>.'' `` If he's looking for American Gothic, I think he's going to be disappointed,'' said <PERSON> Daryl </PERSON> <PERSON> McCready </PERSON>. `` We do n't exactly have hats and pitchforks. We know what's going on in the world.'' None of the residents of this northern <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> town, which is n't even on some state maps, has ever been to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> But most are at least vaguely familiar with the talk show host famous for his `` Stupid Pet Tricks'' routine and off-beat humor. `` His show is on too late for us, although we did all get together and watch his seventh anniversary special,'' said 73-year-old <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>. `` It was kind of interesting.'' <PERSON> Loren </PERSON> <PERSON> Nydegger </PERSON>, a senior basketball player who attends high school at nearby <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ansgar </LOCATION>, said, `` A lot of people are pretty excited about this.'' `` They joke about things like when they introduce the team at games, they'll say, ` And now, going to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and being on the <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> show and also playing guard, <PERSON> Loren </PERSON> <PERSON> Nydegger </PERSON>,''' he said. <PERSON> Jodi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, a talent researcher for the show, suggested <PERSON> Bolan </PERSON> after talent coordinator <PERSON> Madeleine </PERSON> <PERSON> Smithberg </PERSON> came up with the idea of inviting an entire town to be guests on the program. `` The thing is that there's a lot of little towns across the country and <LOCATION> Bolan </LOCATION> is just _ from everything I've read about the town and everything I hear about it _ they're just really a special little community,'' Ms. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>, known for his sometimes sarcastic behavior with guests, will make <PERSON> Bolan </PERSON> residents feel special, she said. Raised in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, he will get along fine with the Iowans. `` He's going to be taken with this whole thing. Of course, he's going to be <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> He's going to joke around. But these people are to be celebrated because they're such wonderful folks and because, hey, the whole town came all the way to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to be on our show,'' she said. The <PERSON> Bolan </PERSON> residents will fly Feb. 28 to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The show will be taped the afternoon of March 1 and broadcast that night. The network is paying for round-trip air fare from <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>, two nights in a hotel, meals and spending money. `` I just hope someone there will meet us at the airport. Could you imagine the headlines: ` Little town gets lost at airport,''' joked <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Nydegger </PERSON>, <PERSON> Loren </PERSON>'s mother. The <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> show is n't the first fame for the 103-year-old <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> town located about 130 miles north of <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>. It was host to 7,000 bicycle riders during a 1987 bike race, and it made national news during its centennial celebration when spectators walked around the town parade because the town is so small. With all <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> has to offer, what will the Iowans do during their stay? <PERSON> Daryl </PERSON> <PERSON> McCready </PERSON> said he wants to visit the Statue of Liberty and the Empire State Building. `` I was so proud when I built my pole barn in 1939, and then they built the Empire State Building that was designed to sway 15 feet at the top. I was n't too proud of my pole barn then.''

<HEAD>Adolescent Beliefs About Alcohol Predict Problem Drinking, Study
Suggests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A questionnaire assessing beliefs about alcohol can identify young adolescents at risk for later problem drinking, according to a study that one expert calls an exciting development in fighting alcohol abuse. When tested with 637 junior high school students, the 90-item questionnaire was an impressively strong predictor of problem drinking a year later, alcohol experts said. Students who believed alcohol could help them think or improve their physical coordination tended to be at particular risk, said study co-author <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, a psychology professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tampa </ORGANIZATION>, reported the study results with co-authors from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Wayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hope </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich </LOCATION>. The work appears in this month's issue of the Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology. `` It's certainly a very exciting development,'' commented <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Marlatt </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Addictive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Behaviors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. He called it the first demonstration that a measure of psychological dependency can predict later alcohol use and tendencies toward problem drinking. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON>, director of the Rutgers-affiliated <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Piscataway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, said the study represents an advance in identifying `` what looks like a rather important difference'' that distinguishes early adolescents at risk of an alcohol problem. The predictions were not perfect, but <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> called their accuracy `` pretty impressive.'' <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> said that since writing the paper, researchers have found the questionnaire also indicates a risk of problem drinking within two years and possibly three. The questionnaire measured how strongly students believed that alcohol could aid them in such ways as helping them relax, be sexier, think better, enjoy social gatherings more, or perform better socially or athletically. Prior research shows that such `` expectancies'' strongly affect the way a person behaves after drinking, quite apart from chemical effects of alcohol, <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> said. The research followed the theory that `` the stronger they believe that alcohol has those positive effects, the more at risk they are for problem drinking,'' <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> said. If such beliefs can be undermined early, that might reduce the attractiveness of alcohol and prevent problem drinking, he said. The questionnaire may help by pinpointing the key beliefs that put individual teen-agers at risk, he said. For example, a teen who looks to alcohol for relaxation can be taught other methods, or perhaps stress in his life can be removed, <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> said. The most predictive part of the questionnaire measured the belief that alcohol improves social performance. `` It's what you'd expect an adolescent to find important, which is how you get along in the social scene,'' <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> said. Another risky belief was that alcohol `` makes you think better and maybe perform better'' physically, he said. `` Believe it or not, these kids think you might drive better under the influence of alcohol. Those are the kids who are really seriously at risk.'' The study focused on 637 seventh - and eighth-graders who filled out the questionnaire and a confidential survey on drinking habits A year later, they again reported on their drinking. In that intervening year, the percentage of students who got drunk at least twice a year jumped from 10 percent to 25 percent. While 7 percent said in the first survey that they had consumed 12 beers or more at a single sitting, 20 percent said so a year later. Those measures and others such as alcohol-related fights, crimes and trouble at home or school were used to define problem drinking. Analysis showed that the occurence or degree of problem drinking by the students was significantly related to how they had answered the questionnaire a year earlier. The relationship also appeared for the 550 students who had not reported any sign of problem drinking at the beginning of the year.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s `` old-boy club,'' which for generations has cheered on former senators if they advanced into the upper reaches of the executive branch, has come unglued under the weight of former Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>'s nomination to be secretary of defense. Tower's <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation is in serious jeopardy, the nominee battered by unproven accusations of heavy drinking, womanizing and lack of objectivity when it comes to defense contractors. Many had expected that Tower's nomination to be the nation's defense chief would enjoy an effortless slide down a carefully greased chute Tower, after all, had been one of the powers of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> where he served for two dozen years and presided as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> _ the same panel now being asked to confirm him. If he expected special treatment, he did n't get it. Instead, his nomination became snared in a web of allegations and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigations. Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., the current <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> chairman, had made clear months before last fall's election that he intended to subject new nominees for top Pentagon positions to intense scrutiny in an effort to improve the quality of key officials `` I said several times that it was n't going to be an old-boy hearing, that we were going to have a thorough review.'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> says. `` The presumption that it was going to be something less was wrong from the beginning. Period.'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> calls the Tower screening `` the most exhaustive process and investigation anyone's gone through in my memory in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` I think everybody thought that the old-boy network would work as it always has and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> would go sailing through, but it has n't worked that way,'' said Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Exon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Neb </LOCATION>., the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s second-ranking Democrat Many members, including <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, speak of the process of sifting and judging the merits of allegations against Tower in terms of personal pain. The pain is evidently more intense against the backdrop of a courtly, clubby institution in which members routinely refer to colleagues as `` distinguished'' and `` honorable'' and hasten to smooth over the wounds of legislative combat with flowery compliments. `` This is a painful process,'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> says. `` It's painful for the nominee, painful for the president, painful for the committee and painful for me. It's frustrating. It's not enjoyable.'' In part, Tower's troubles may stem from the fact that he apparently entered the confirmation process with a relatively low reservoir of good will among his former colleagues. Many senators say privately that they were not fond of what they say was Tower's testy temper and autocratic operating style. Few are willing to say that in public _ but some are. `` Tower is a former member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. But it is probably also the case that he does n't have a lot of intimate friends here or any aura of popularity or good will,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ind </LOCATION>., who was chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Relations committee at the time Tower headed Armed Services `` He is not necessarily a person who ingratiates himself with anybody,'' <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON> said. Some Republican senators are saying that while they remain publicly supportive of the Tower nomination, it is more out of a sense of loyalty to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, rather than out of any sense of loyalty or affection toward Tower. `` They are saying, ` we owe it to the president, not Tower,''' <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON> said. `` I do n't notice anything clubby in this one at all,'' he said. The question inevitably is raised of whether the Tower nomination is being hammered by old-fashioned partisan politics. Some Republican operatives are saying exactly that, accusing the Democrats who control the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> of causing difficulties for the new administration in part to assert their majority status, and in part as an expression of frustration over their party's defeat in last year's presidential contest. Not so, says <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, whose own credentials are hardly those of a left-wing <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> basher. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., a former secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and the panel's ranking Republican, backs him up The two lawmakers say they have worked as 50-50 partners throughout the hearings and investigations and constantly shared information. `` <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> has been fair, equitable and _ steadfastly _ he has been non-political,'' <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said late last week. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said he put the question of fairness directly to Tower himself. `` I said, ` <PERSON> John </PERSON>, if you were in the position <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> and I now find ourselves in ... would you do it any differently?''' The answer? `` Sen. Tower looked us right in the eye and said, ` No,''' <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said.

 Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> met Monday with the head of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and welcomed the opening of the first Jewish cultural center in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 50 years, a member of the congress said. <PERSON> Isi </PERSON> <PERSON> Leibler </PERSON>, a vice president of the congress who said he did not attend the meeting but was briefed on it, said <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> `` expressed optimism about the opening of the center.'' The Solomon Mikhoels Cultural Center was opened Sunday in southeastern <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, and more than 70 foreign Jewish leaders, ambassadors and Soviet officials attended. <PERSON> Leibler </PERSON>, who also is the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Executive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Australian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewry </ORGANIZATION>, said in an interview he could not divulge details of <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s meeting with <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON>. He listed the topics discussed as Jewish culture, religion, emigration and refuseniks _ the term for those denied permission to leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The official Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON> discussed with <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> a settlement of the rift between the <LOCATION> Arabs </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israelis </LOCATION> and that the foreign minister again appealed for convening an international conference on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. `` In our view, it is time to undertake immediate steps to begin concrete preparations for the conference,'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> was quoted as saying. In November, <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON>'s organization announced after he met with <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and other Soviet officials that the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> had given the green light for opening the cultural center. The World Jewish <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which represents Jewish groups in 70 countries, also said Soviet officials agreed to lift a ban on the teaching of Hebrew. Hebrew and Yiddish classes are planned at the <ORGANIZATION> Solomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mikhoels </ORGANIZATION> center. At the opening, Nobel Peace Prize winner <PERSON> Elie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiesel </PERSON> said President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> deserved praise for freeing several jailed Jews and opening the door to freer emigration of Jews.

Do n't be too quick, though. `` Die Hard'' turns out to be a sleeper of a thriller with perky dialogue and a believable <PERSON> Willis </PERSON>, if you can get past his Rambo-like dirty undershirt and AK-47. Just about all of the movie takes place in a newly built <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> skyscraper where <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McClane </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> police officer, has gone to visit his estranged wife, <PERSON> Holly </PERSON>, a top executive for a Japanese corporation.

<HEAD>Thousands of Farmers Protest Gov't Agricultural Policy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thousands of militant farmers burned cars and hulred firebombs at riot police in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> on Monday, protesting what they called the government's disastrous agricultural policy. Police fired tear gas to end the two-hour protest by an estimated 15,000 farmers who gathered in front of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, which opened a special 20-day session Monday. The South Korean news agency, <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION>, said at least 15 farmers and seven riot police were injured. Six cars were set ablaze and two others were smashed with sticks, it said. Police said 25 protesters were arrested. Fighting erupted when thousands of farmers tried to march into the Assembly compound after a rally, during which they accused the government of pushing an `` impoverished'' agricultural policy. `` Dismiss officials who have ruined farming!'' protesters shouted, waving anti-government placards. They also denounced the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, accusing it of trying to force open <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s agricultral market. One placard read: `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, stop pressure for agricultural import liberalization.'' The farmers demanded the government abolish the `` irrigation tax'' and purchase excess red peppers produced this year. They said the government encouraged red pepper plantings, causing an oversupply. About 4,000 riot police blocked the march. The protesters hurled firebombs and hit police with wooden and bamboo sticks. Police responded with volleys of tear gas. The protesters broke pavement blocks into fist-size rocks and threw them at police. Dozens of protesters ran into a dense fog of tear gas and punched and kicked police. Some protesters tossed firebombs that parked cars ablaze. The protesters also burned several makeshift buildings on a nearby plaza, including one where a machinery exhibition was held. They also burned dozens of trees. The farmers withdrew in two hours, and they returned home aboard buses they chartered to travel to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> for the protest.

 President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> opened a much-postponed Central American summit today, saying the five leaders are optimistic about bringing peace and progress to the turbulent region. Flanked by Presidents <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Vinicio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerezo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> made the brief statement opening the meeting at <LOCATION> Tesoro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, a seaside resort 40 miles southeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. `` I am sure that we, with optimism, will analyze the efforts we've made according to the <ORGANIZATION> Esquipulas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> II </ORGANIZATION> plan and search for favorable solutions that will promote peace and progress in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> said. Then the presidents went into closed session. The stalled peace plan was named for the Guatemalan city where the five presidents decided to sign the August 1987 agreement. Diplomats say <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s four neighbors plan to press its government for democratic reforms promised under the peace plan. `` The main roadblock in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> has been removed _ the Contras,'' said one diplomat referring to the decline of the Nicaraguan rebels called Contras. `` There are no more obstacles -LRB- to reform -RRB- and no more excuses.'' At the same time, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> probably has most to gain from the conference, which it hopes will help destroy the Contras. `` Among the most important things that will be dealt with at the summit is the matter of verification and control of borders,'' <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> told a news conference last week. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said upon his arrival Sunday that he believed the leaders `` are going to ratify'' a new plan to step up border controls to prevent the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> neighbors from supporting subversion against one another. Central American foreign ministers met <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> last week and called for creation of `` an impartial mechanism'' to verify compliance along borders. About 11,000 Contras remain in Honduran camps near <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s border, but the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has made no request for renewed military aid and senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials acknowledge the era of an anti-Sandinista army as an arm of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy has passed <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> has scheduled elections for 1990 and has met with opposition leaders to discuss its recent economic austerity measures, but the opposition claims Sandinista talk of democratic reform is window dressing. A Costa Rican diplomat said that unless the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> make `` precise commitments and agree to deadlines for democratization measures ... we will have to prepare for the peace plan's funeral and the Nicaraguans will have to accept responsibility for its demise.'' <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> won the Nobel Peace Prize for writing the plan, which is designed to bring peace and promote democracy in the turbulent region. `` We go to the summit full of optimism, despite the obstacles, because reality demands the search for solutions to the problems we Central Americans have,'' <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> was quoted as saying by the Costa Rican newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diario </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> la </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republica </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday. A summit in August was to mark the anniversary of the plan's signing, but the presidents, who last met 13 months ago, could not agree on an agenda The meeting has since been scheduled and postponed five times. When the peace plan was signed, stubborn civil wars plagued <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and the Contras were waging a fierce campaign against the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s U.S.-backed government and the leftist guerrillas battling it were unable to negotiate a cease-fire. <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>'s leftist rebels have been reduced to isolated zones but remain active, and <ORGANIZATION> Cerezo </ORGANIZATION>'s government has not sought negotiations The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> cut off military aid to the Contras a year ago, and the rebels signed a preliminary cease-fire with the Sandinistas in March. Although some fighting continues, it now is scattered and sporadic. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, however, has been strongly criticized for failing to live up to the plan's requirement to strengthen democratic institutions and practices. Besides that, the plan calls for amnesties for political prisoners, a halt to outside aid to insurgents, and prohibits signatories from allowing their territory to be used as bases for attacks against another's territory.

<HEAD>Rape Battleground Moves To Civil Courts As Defendants Sue Alleged
Victims</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN K. PAULSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOULDER, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION> District Attorney <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> says there has been no lack of volunteers since he asked attorneys to donate their time to defend rape victims sued by the men who allegedly attacked them. `` We have already had two cases in the last several months in which the suspects have instituted civil suits against the victim,'' he said. `` I ca n't remember another situation like this involving rape victims in the 16 years I have been district attorney.'' Local rape crisis officials say the lawsuits against victims will deter even more women from reporting sex crimes. Such lawsuits, which also have been filed elsewhere, usually stem from rape cases in which the people involved either were dating or were acquainted, officials say. In one of the two <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION> cases, <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> football player <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Massucco </PERSON> filed a slander suit against a <ORGANIZATION> CU </ORGANIZATION> student after he was charged with first-degree sexual assault. His attorney, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, said his client only kissed the woman. He said <PERSON> Massucco </PERSON> `` is not going to sit idly by and let this happen.'' <PERSON> Massucco </PERSON> alleges the woman made `` wrongful, careless and negligent allegations'' that humiliated him. In the other case, a woman filed a lawsuit against her alleged attacker after prosecutors refused to file criminal charges. The man filed a countersuit after the woman refused to sign a statement absolving him of guilt. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Caplis </PERSON>, an attorney for that 18-year-old man, said his client did n't want to sue, but felt he had no other way to clear his name. The man accuses the woman of abuse of process, malicious prosecution and outrageous conduct. `` You have to take these cases individually,'' <PERSON> Caplis </PERSON> said. `` My client is not guilty. I understand the concern of the rape crisis personnel, and I share that. I might even volunteer to help on some of the cases myself. But you have to consider it case by case.'' <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharpe </PERSON>, a counselor for the Rape Crisis Center in <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>, said there is a concern that a legal precedent might be set if one of the women loses her case. She said the fact that attorneys are willing to volunteer their time to defend such cases will help persuade women to come forward. `` I think the fact that attorneys are volunteering their time sends a message that they believe in the victim. There is always the possibility they could lose the case, but having someone standing by your side is a powerful statement,'' she said. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Biele </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sexual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assaults </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, said of the trend to lawsuits that many prosecutors are unwilling to take on date rape cases unless they have a good chance of winning. `` Some are poor cases and need to be turned down, some of them are so awful it would be unethical to file charges, but others could be prosecuted and they simply wo n't take them, because they're not sure of winning,'' she said. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Enwall </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Boulder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge, has offered his help to defend women but said civil court is not the place to fight such battles. He said defendants in rape cases who believe they have been wrongly accused should seek redress in criminal court, where perjury charges could be filed. But he said that because of the different evidence requirements in civil and criminal courts, the wrongly accused have a better chance of winning in civil court. In criminal courts, prosecutors must prove a defendant's guilt beyond a shadow of a doubt _ sometimes difficult to do in rape cases, especially those involving date rape. In civil courts, the only requirement is a `` preponderance of evidence.''

<HEAD>No Halt To Government Sales of Gas, Despite `Serious' Shortage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it has no plans to stop selling tritium to private customers despite what it calls an approaching shortage of the radioactive gas, which is used in manufacturing most <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear weapons. The government has been selling tritium to private corporations and research groups, both domestic and foreign, for decades. But the practice has come under review since the nation's only maker of the gas was shut down last spring. The Energy Department, in charge of making all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear warheads and their components, has cited the risk of a tritium squeeze in urging <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to approve construction of two new-generation tritium-producing reactors to replace the aging and inefficient <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> reactor complex near <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION>, S.C. The <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> reactors were closed down last spring for safety-related reasons, and no firm timetable for resuming operation has been set. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Keif </PERSON>, a department spokesman, said officials decided to continue the tritium sales since the amounts involved are `` a small piece'' of total supplies, and since the government expects at least one of the three <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> reactors to be restarted by year's end <PERSON> Keif </PERSON> said the government expects to sell about 230 grams of tritium in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30. At the current sales prices of about $ 28,000 per gram, this year's sales would be worth about $ 6.4 million. The price was more than doubled last Oct. 1. The amount of tritium in existing stockpiles, and the government's annual requirements, are classified. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuperman </PERSON>, issues director at the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a private policy group, said it is generally believed that the Pentagon uses between 5,000 and 8,000 grams of tritium a year. Tritium is used in most nuclear weapons to increase the explosive power of the warhead. The gas decays relatively quickly and so must be replenished periodically. Tritium is used commercially for a variety of research and medical purposes and for making self-luminous lights, signs, dials, watches and gun sights. Last year the department, through its <ORGANIZATION> Oak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, sold 247 grams of tritium to 24 customers, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, a spokesman at <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION>. He said 94 grams were purchased by domestic organizations, and 153 grams went to foreign buyers, including <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. `` Oak Ridge has received no information from headquarters that we should stop'' taking commercial orders, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Keif </PERSON> said the situation was under regular review. `` We looked it over, it's an option to stop'' commercial sales, <PERSON> Keif </PERSON> said. But for the time being sales will continue, he added, since the squeeze on tritium supplies is not critical. `` It's serious, but it's not critical,'' <PERSON> Keif </PERSON> said. Earlier this month, <PERSON> Troy </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, the acting assistant secretary for defense programs, told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel the department hoped to get one of the three <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> production reactors back in operation by the end of the year. `` If a reactor is not restarted this year, then the supply of tritium could be reduced to such an extent that the nuclear stockpile may be affected,'' he said. Last fall the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> suggested a serious shortage would develop by this summer if production were not resumed. Some private analysts said the government's willingness to continue selling tritium could mean supplies are less limited than the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has suggested. <PERSON> Kuperman </PERSON> said his group believes the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could maintain its current stockpile of nuclear weapons for three to six years without any additional tritium production. The <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> last month reported that an internal <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> study said the halt to tritium production could continue for another 18 months to two years without affecting the readiness of the nuclear arsenal.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, on his first diplomatic tour of West European capitals, is finding it difficult to compete with the public relations blitz of Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, a senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said Monday. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> also is having his problems with West German leaders and their reluctance to support the upgrading of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s tactical nuclear missiles, the official said. But after touching base in six of the 15 allied capitals, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s biggest problem is <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and the inroads he has made in Western European public opinion. `` There is just an attraction, an intriguing quality to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> that you have to answer somehow,'' said the official, who participated in most of the meetings <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> has held on his trip. `` We have no answer,'' the official told reporters as <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> flew back to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for talks with Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>. Responding to strong disaramament trends among the <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> people, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> last week proposed a delay of two or three years in upgrading the short-range Lance missile deployed in the country. The <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> faces a decision in a few months on whether to double the range of the U.S.-built rockets from 70 miles to about 150 miles. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> told reporters he wants <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> to build into its defense strategy a disarmament mandate if the allies go ahead with a plan. After talking to the chancellor, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told reporters he hoped the issue could be settled at a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit meeting, which is being planned for late May in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>. He said <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> gave assurances that he was not `` backing off'' <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s approval of a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> declaration last year, saying the allied defense should mix nuclear and conventional weapons that `` will continue to be kept up to date.'' Covering 15 capitals in eight days is testing <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s endurance. Monday, for instance, was a three-country day with stops in <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Tuesday will be no easier, with <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> going to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. The conversations so far in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> have been `` warm, personal and professional,'' said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, who requested anonymity. `` It's going very, very well.'' And yet, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official acknowledged, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> is having a difficult time competing with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s high-profile diplomacy. The Soviet leader is withdrawing Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and offered to remove six tank divisions and 50,000 men from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> pointed out to the Western ministers that at home, however, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is faced with a failing economy and that `` the jury is still out on whether he will be successful'' in trying to revive it, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said. The challenge <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and the allies face `` is not a question of an initiative,'' the official said. `` People feel very comfortable that we have the initiative on substance. But it is undeniable that as you go around people can see that when it comes to capturing public attention the Western agenda has a hard time competing with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s own ability to attract attention.''

<HEAD>Famous Cave Victim's Body To Be Reinterred At Mammoth Cave</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HORSE CAVE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The body of cave explorer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, whose 1925 entrapment and death in a cave became national news, will be laid to rest again spring, perhaps for the last time. After his death in Sand Cave, <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>' body was recovered and buried, exhumed for public display, stolen and dumped along the banks of the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, and put back on display. `` The time has come to let him rest in peace,'' said <PERSON> Donnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, a Horse Cave resident and <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>' great-nephew. `` He deserves it after all these years.'' <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>' relatives and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> have worked out arrangements to re-inter the body. `` He'll be buried in a cemetery on the -LRB- Mammoth Cave -RRB- National Park grounds in late March,'' <PERSON> Donnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said. `` We're not sure exactly when it will be, but there's no rush after all this time. He's still dead.'' The park now includes caves that <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> discovered and died in. <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> was 37 when he entered Sand Cave on Jan. 30, 1925, in hopes of finding a new entrance to Crystal Cave, the cavern he discovered under his father's <ORGANIZATION> Edmonson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> farm on Jan. 18, 1917. Caves in the area were privately operated then, and competition for tourists' dollars was intense. <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> was on his way out of Sand Cave _ head-first and on his back _ when he was trapped in a small passageway by rocks that fell onto his foot and ankle. More than 30 news agencies sent reporters to the site, and thousands of spectators watched while rescuers tried in vain to dig a shaft parallel to the cave to reach <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>. <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> was pronounced dead Feb. 16 _ 18 days after entering the cave. His body was removed from the cave without fanfare and was buried near an entrance to Crystal Cave. Later, the body was disinterred, placed in a different casket and displayed in a large cavern in Crystal Cave. It was stolen four years later. The body was found at the edge of the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, but one of <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>' legs _ the one which had been trapped by the rocks _ had been sawed off. Eventually, the body was redressed and returned to <LOCATION> Crystal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cave </LOCATION>, where it remains today in a black casket chained securely to a concrete base. That cave has been closed since 1961, when it was bought by the Park Service. Until then, <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>' casket was the highlight of tours and, until 1948, visitors could view the body through a window in the casket lid. `` I'm tickled to death they're finally going to bury him for good,'' said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, a Bowling Green police polygraph examiner. During his college days, he worked for O.O. <PERSON> Burgess </PERSON>, the funeral home director who embalmed <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>. After <PERSON> Burgess </PERSON> died, his daughter gave <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> a set of slides <PERSON> Burgess </PERSON> had bought that photographically detailed the events surrounding <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>' death. `` That's part of the commercialism of the whole deal,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. `` I would n't trade those slides for anything, but it shows you the way <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> was exploited after his death.''

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Roseanne'' breaks ground this week with a girl's coming-of-age story that gives series star <PERSON> Roseanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> a chance to show a softer side. In Tuesday night's episode of the hit blue-collar sitcom, 11-year-old <PERSON> Darlene </PERSON>, portrayed by <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, gets her period. The episode, written by <PERSON> Grace </PERSON> <PERSON> McKeaney </PERSON> and directed by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pasquin </PERSON>, handles the subject gently, while still being funny. Co-executive producer <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> said Monday he is unaware of any sitcom that has dealt with a girl's puberty in such a way before. `` I think it's a terrific area to be doing,'' he said. `` Obviously, we're doing a family show, and we're trying to do something that is not only entertaining but is informative. `` And I think it's an important story because I think it's important for young women to know what menstruation is about before it begins so that perhaps they wo n't be as frightened and confused by it, as certainly can happen,'' he said <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> and his partner, <PERSON> Marcy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carsey </PERSON>, also are executive producers of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s top-rated `` The Cosby Show.'' `` Roseanne,'' the biggest new hit of the season and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s top-rated show, recently underwent a change in producers. Co-creator <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> left, citing creative differences with <PERSON> Barr </PERSON>. <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> said the Tuesday episode was written after <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> left, but does n't necessarily reflect a change in the direction of the sitcom. `` I think we're always trying to make good episodes, and I think it's a chance to do a problem from a mother's point of view that is interesting and different,'' he said. The episode begins with the family gathering around the TV set to watch scary movies. <PERSON> Roseanne </PERSON> is not particularly thrilled, since the kids tend to be up half the night with nightmares. Sure enough, <PERSON> Darlene </PERSON> ca n't sleep, but she insists it is n't because of a dream. By the next morning, the irrepressible tomboy is moping around. `` Are you worried about your basketball game?'' her parents ask. `` No, I'm not worried about the basketball game.'' `` Did you screw up in history again?'' `` No, I did n't screw up in history again. I got my period, OK?'' <PERSON> Darlene </PERSON> stomps out, leaving <PERSON> Roseanne </PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> -RRB-, to gape at each other. Later that day, <PERSON> Roseanne </PERSON> and her sister, <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Metcalf </PERSON> -RRB-, recall their mother's less-than-helpful advice to `` feel free to ask the school nurse'' if they had any questions about the change of life. In what <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> describes aptly as `` a lovely scene,'' <PERSON> Darlene </PERSON> runs into <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> in the garage. He feels compelled to say something on this momentous occasion, but all he can come up with is a punch in the arm and an awkward, `` Good goin'!'' When <PERSON> Darlene </PERSON> starts throwing out her beloved sports paraphernalia, <PERSON> Roseanne </PERSON> gets the chance to dispense some motherly wisdom. `` I thought there was a lovely scene from <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>'s point of view in the show,'' <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> said. `` I thought that the way <PERSON> Roseanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Conner-slash-Roseanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> handled it was terrific because I think she tried to discuss the problem with her, which I think is important, and she actually made her daughter feel like this was the beginning of a new and exciting phase in her life and welcome to being a woman.'' <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> said the episode was probably originally the idea of writer <PERSON> McKeaney </PERSON>, though it would have been developed by the writers with <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> and was a subject almost everyone on the show could relate to in some way. `` I'm going through it as a father,'' <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> said. `` Roseanne obviously has gone through it as a mother. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, who is the head writer, has gone through it as a father. I think we're excited about it because I think it was handled in a well-crafted way, and I think it made its point without being too heavy-handed.''

 Moslem fundamentalists around the world demand that <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s novel `` The Satanic Verses'' be banned as blasphemy against <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>, and this weekend the campaign turned violent. At least five people were killed and more than 80 injured Sunday when police fired on a mob trying to storm the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>. The protesters demanded the book be banned in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Fundamentalists say the book does not recognize <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION> as the one true religion and ridicules the most precious Moslem beliefs. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and other Moslem nations banned the book after its publication last year. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, 41, was born in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> to Moslem parents and educated in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, where he lives. His other books include `` Midnight's Children,'' which won <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s prestigious Booker prize, `` Shame'' and `` The Jaguar Smile. The literary success of `` The Satanic Verses,'' a complex work that focuses on good and evil, has been confined to a fairly small intellectual readership in Western nations. In November, the book won the `` new novel'' category in the annual literary competition sponsored by the Whitbread brewing giant, but it did not win the overall Whitbread prize. Leaders of the <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> march said it was intended to be peaceful but police reacted improperly. Government officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the protest apparently was inspired by reviews last week in international news magazines. One official said: `` The reviews had the first details anyone had about the book. Nobody here has read the book.'' `` The Satanic Verses'' is a rambling fantasy on the birth of religion, modern history and human relations. It begins with two men tumbling skyward from a jumbo jet destroyed by a terrorist bomb and chronicles their adventures. A part of the novel fictionalizes certain episodes from the Koran, the Moslem holy book, and the life of the prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> in what Western book critics say is clearly satire. They have praised the book for imaginative vision and depth. The author says his book is a work of fiction that does not attack Islam, contains no blasphemy and is not intended to offend anyone. `` It is not a source of satisfaction to me to be banned in the Moslem world,'' he said in a recent interview with the <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>, a Pakistani magazine. Moslem leaders describe the novel as an attack on Mohammed intended to insult Moslems and lead them astray. <PERSON> Syed </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Younus </PERSON> <PERSON> Kazmi </PERSON>, a Pakistani Moslem leader, said: `` The book has fictitious characters that carricature the holy prophet and his companions. The book contains insulting and derogratory remarks.'' <PERSON> Kazmi </PERSON> and other Islamic theologians say the book must be banned because it does not treat <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> as the prophet of the world's one true religion. They believe <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> and the Koran must be portrayed only as representing divine truth. `` <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> has offended millions of Moslems around the world,'' <PERSON> Kazmi </PERSON> said in an interview. `` Such a person can not be allowed to do these things.'' Fundamentalist leaders claimed Sunday's march was not an anti-American protest, even though many of their followers see the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as a corrupt secular culture and enemy of Islam. Protesters chanted `` American dogs'' and other slogans against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` It was not an attack on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. We just hoped to create moral support for our cause to stop this unholy book being printed again,'' <PERSON> Kazmi </PERSON> said. Leaflets circulated by fundamentalist groups characterize the novel as a blasphemous, semi-pornographic attack that says the prophet was inspired by the devil, his wife was a prostitute and his companions were evil. `` There are insulting remarks in this book,'' said <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadiq </PERSON>, a theology student. `` There are lies in this book. We want this book banned in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and around the world.'' According to the author, his novel has been distorted by fundamentalists who have not read it and oppose any idea that does not reflect their fanatical literal faith. He said he has received death threats. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> has declared himself fascinated by religion and its development and role in history. He has been quoted as saying religions are `` codes with which human beings have tried to understand their presence on the planet and discuss their moral behavior. My point of view is that of a secular human being. I do not believe in supernatural entities, whether Christian, Jewish, Moslem or Hindu.'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> and other government leaders called the protest at the American center an attack by fundamentalist parties trying to drive her from office by straining relations with <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s ally, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> says he has every right to deal with Islam in a creative fashion, and `` I am not going to run away from the subject because it is my subject and it is my birthright and nobody can take that away from me.''

 A teen-ager who was scolded by his parents because of bad grades apparently killed his father to avoid a whipping, authorities said. `` The mother and father had gotten on the child for bad grades and the father was going to whip him with a belt,'' said <LOCATION> Leflore </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> <PERSON> Banks </PERSON>. <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Dewayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>, 17, was charged with murder in the Sunday afternoon shooting of <PERSON> Mellon </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 44.

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> said farewell to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> in a ceremony at the frigid airport Monday, then paratroopers in fur hats and padded uniforms decorated with Afghan medals climbed into a jet transport and were flown away. Some Soviet soldiers remained but officials said they would be gone by Wednesday, the deadline for the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> to have all its forces out of a civil war it entered more than nine years ago. A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> airlift has been suspended because a cargo plane loaded with food and medicine left <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> in neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> without clearance and another airline pulled out of the program, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials said. A Swedish airline said it was sending a plane to <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> and would carry the emergency cargo if thre was no risk to the aircraft or crew, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s national airline TT reported. In <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, Afghan guerrillas briefly resumed a Moslem council Monday that was called originally to choose an interim government, but two important leaders did not attend and spokesmen said factional quarrels about power sharing continued. The guerrillas, who began fighting after a communist coup in April 1978, predict the Marxist government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> will fall soon after the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> completes its withdrawal under a U.N.-mediated agreement. Soviet soldiers entered the country in December 1979 and totaled an estimated 115,000 when the withdrawal began May 15. At an airport ceremony Monday to which 150 foreign journalists were invited, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Pytor </PERSON> <PERSON> Sardarchuk </PERSON> praised 15 young paratroopers who stood in front of their Antonov-12 transport plane. `` We have helped <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> create order and provided economic supplies and other goods,'' he said. `` Now you are leaving Afghan soil and I want to say thank you very much for your service and to wish you all the best, happiness and health and a safe return home.'' Capt. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhadan </PERSON> said: `` The medals on our chest _ Afghan medals _ bear witness to what we have accomplished. We would like to hope that there will be peace in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and that the people of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> will remember us fondly.'' At least one departing soldier, a 20-year-old, questioned the accomplishments. `` I think it could have been done peacefully,'' he said in answer to a question as he boarded the plane, which took off for <LOCATION> Tashkent </LOCATION>. He said he thought Soviet intervention `` was all a big mistake.'' Paratroopers waved through the windows as the plane taxied down the runway and took off. It climbed in a tight spiral because of the surrounding mountains and spouted flares to deflect any heat-seeking missiles guerrillas in the mountains might fire. About 450 Soviet soldiers quietly left the besieged capital Sunday during a snowstorm. <PERSON> Sardarchuk </PERSON> would not say how many soldiers remained in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> after Monday's ceremony, which had been billed as the departure of the last Red Army troopers. They could be seen in armored personnel carriers posted around the airport's military section and along its perimeter. `` It's a deception of sorts,'' a Soviet diplomat said privately. He and <PERSON> Sardarchuk </PERSON> said the remaining Soviet troops would be gone by Wednesday. The Soviets completed a food airlift to the capital Sunday, the same day the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> effort was suspended. <ORGANIZATION> Ethiopian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> delivered 32 tons of wheat and dried milk Friday in what was to be the first of 10 flights, but backed out of the contract. <ORGANIZATION> EgyptAir </ORGANIZATION> was the original charter airline, but last week refused to fly to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> on safety grounds. <PERSON> Romero </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said an <ORGANIZATION> EgyptAir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 707 originally scheduled to begin the airlift last Tuesday `` left in the middle of the night Wednesday without any clearance and with our cargo,'' 32 tons of food and medicine. `` We do n't know exactly where'' the cargo is, he said. Prince <PERSON> Sadruddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Aga </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, coordinator of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> aid program for <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, told a Sunday news conference <ORGANIZATION> Ethiopian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> had refused to continue the airlift. <PERSON> Da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> said Ethiopian officials told him the insurance premiums lwere too high. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agencies had hoped to deliver another 360 tons of food, medicine and blankets by Wednesday for the poorest residents of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, which has been swollen by refugees to twice its normal population of 1 million. `` These people are not the ones who will carry the guns,'' one source said of the women and children lining up for food. `` These are people who are hungry and will suffer the most if the situation deteriorates.'' <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> relief centers opened on Monday to distribute food in some of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s poorest neighborhoods. At two relief centers, workers gave packages containing a small can of powdered milk, a 22-pound bag of flour and a blanket to 800 women and to children under age 5. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials said the rations were meant to supplement regular food supplies and should last a family three weeks.

<HEAD>Grosz Speech Tough on Media, `Extremists' Outside Party</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> attacked the state media in a speech published Monday, and he ruled out cooperation with `` extremists'' outside the party. The speech was delivered at a secretive two-day session of the party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that for the first time endorsed the introduction of a multiparty system in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. The body agreed to open talks with representatives of the many alternative movements that have sprung up recently, but set no firm timetable for the first multiparty elections or other aspects of the new system, saying a transition must be gradual. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>'s speech, which opened the session Friday, was n't published until Monday, when it appeared in the party daily <ORGANIZATION> Nepszabadsag </ORGANIZATION>. He attacked the unidentified `` extremist wing'' of the alternative organizations that were legalized last month. A bill due to be passed by Aug. 1 in parliament is to legalize alternative political parties. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> made clear these parties would be expected not to reject socialism outright, to accept <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s membership of the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> military alliance, and to `` prevent any deepening'' of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s current crisis. There is increasing dissatisfaction over a range of austerity measures and price increases <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> and other leaders insist are essential to boost the economy and help repay the $ 17 billion foreign debt. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> said the party's support is narrowing and the alleged extremists outside the party try to undermine it further by talking of divisions between reform communists and Stalinists, preventing the creation of a viable center. He also accused the more outspoken programs on state radio and TV and particularly the daily <ORGANIZATION> Magyar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nemzet </ORGANIZATION>, which has published astonishing articles in recent months, of undermining the system and spreading lies. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> seemed to be trying to carve out a middle ground, making attacks that would please old guard communists but also praising what he called the `` more composed'' forces in the new alternative groups. `` There is a realistic possibility to establish a lasting political alliance with these forces,'' <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> said, without identifying them. A party sociologist interviewed in the trade union daily Nepszava on Monday singled out the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democractic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forum </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Smallholders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and another agrarian-based group as possible partners for the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The sociologist, <PERSON> Istvan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stumpf </PERSON>, said he thought the Social Democrats stood `` a very good chance of regaining credit for the idea of socialism.'' His phrasing, <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>'s statements and the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> communique suggested the communists see a multiparty system as a vehicle for making socialism popular again, rather than introducing Western-style democracy. <PERSON> Stumpf </PERSON> said no one alternative group had worked out a fully viable economic and political program and called for the alternatives to be given full access to data needed to conceive such policies. That would mean opening up government economic and other data to groups outside the party, which dominates virtually the entire state and government apparatus. Neither <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Stumpf </PERSON> set any date for introducing a fully operational multiparty system or any possible coalition. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> said the transition would take a long time and that parliamentary elections next year would mark only the first stage. Representatives from five of the alternative groups met later Monday and gave a guarded welcome to the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s statement <PERSON> Balint </PERSON> <PERSON> Major </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> statement `` definitely means some progress'' but contains `` some bombshells'' that suggest the ruling party is still reluctant to share power.

 Pressures to attract grants, develop drugs and publish new findings create an environment that tolerates fraud and misconduct in medical research, a study said Monday. Although the study, by the private <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, said that instances of outright larboratory fraud remain rare, its authors recommended that the medical research community overhaul the ways it polices itself to control such things as fabricated data, plagarism and carelessness. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubenstein </PERSON>, chairman of medicine at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>, said that in the last decade there has been a sharpened competition for shrinking research funds and a growing need to establish reputations through the publication of findings. `` All of these create new stresses in which people ... would be forced to do this -LRB- commit research misconduct -RRB- more likely than they would have been 10 years ago,'' he said. To protect society from research flaws, he said, the science community needs to use new ways to encourage ethical research and to deal with cheaters. Past methods, including peer review and duplication of test results, are not enough now to prevent careless, sloppy or fraudulent research, he said. Generally, the public has not been affected directly by research misconduct, but fake research has caused lost time and effort by other scientists who trusted such findings, the committee said. `` A very small percentage of causes of out-and-out fraud have had a public impact,'' said committee member <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, School of Medicine. `` Luckily, most cases have not had an impact on how doctors treat patients.'' He said, however, that one research finding later proven to be false was printed in 30 scientific journals before it was detected. After the fraud was discovered, said <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, the journals `` did n't know what to do'' and only now are trying to find a way to deal with phony published research The Institute of Medicine, chartered by the quasi-governmental <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, organized the 17-member committee in 1987 after a series of fraudulent and careless laboratory reports had come to light. The committee was charged with developing proposals to strengthen professional standards in the nation's federal and academic laboratories The report said that few institutions have explicit research guidelines. This allows the system `` to tolerate substandard activities by a small number of individual investigators who fail to observe generally accepted practices,'' the report added. At the news conference, <PERSON> Rubenstein </PERSON> said that the amount of fraud in university, government and industry research can not be estimated. The committee report said that in the last decade there have been incidents of serious research misconduct at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. These incidents, the study said, `` raised new questions about the ability of academic institutions to conduct objective investigations of misconduct by their own faculty members or research staff.'' A system of peer review and replication of research findings has been a standard way to guard against science errors, the committee said. But it said this system has failed because findings often are n't checked by replication in other laboratories and the peer review system depends on trust. The committee noted that researchers are pressured to build a list of publications to which they have contributed. Academic advancement and salary increases can depend on the number of publications. As a result, the committee said, some authors credited with reports often participated only marginally; the leaders of some laboratories put their names on all research from their labs, and the names of prominent researchers were often added to those of the true authors in an effort to assure publication. To correct the problems, the committee made 16 recommendations. These included: _ That by 1992 all institutions conducting medical research for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> be required to adopt specific policies to promote ethical research practices and to investigate misconduct _ That the <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> limit the number of publications considered in a grant application so that evaluations of a researcher's work are based on quality, not quantity _ That academic departments should adopt new authorship policies not emphasizing quantity _ That `` whistleblowers,'' those who report scientific misconduct, be protected

 Lawyers for <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> said in two court filings released today that they would be unable to defend him adequately under a proposed agreement to control the use of classified material <PERSON> North </PERSON> wants to use in his defense. The proposed agreement `` would guarantee a ` cuckoo-clock' trial that would make a mockery of the adversarial process,'' said <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> He said that without the information he wants to present, `` we can not adequately defend this case.'' Part of the proposed agreement would bar North from offering evidence about Central American countries' support for the Contras in exchange for favors by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. Under the agreement, `` a candid admission'' by the government of a quid pro quo arrangement would be sufficient, said the court filing by independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said that a quid pro quo admission `` fails to acknowledge that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and other top Administration officials established a policy that the arrangements would not be disclosed outside the Executive Branch. If imposed by the court, said <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, that part of the agreement `` would cripple the defense of this case.'' The agreement was worked out between <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s office, which is prosecuting <PERSON> North </PERSON>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which fears that <PERSON> North </PERSON> will spill classified material at his trial damaging to national security. The proposed order sought under the agreement would `` gut the defense'' by barring North from using `` critical information about the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's third-country arrangements for military support of the -LRB- Nicaraguan -RRB- Resistance and the official non-disclosure of those arrangements,'' said one of the filings by <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>. In referring to a `` cuckoo-clock'' trial, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> was quoting the judge in the Iran-Contra case, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> has made it clear that he does n't want constant interruptions at the trial to hear objections about national security concerns. The government's proposed order would have nine categories of classified information that should not be revealed at trial before prosecutors have had an opportunity to contest its relevance. They include information identifying undercover <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> officers, the locations of <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> stations, identities of foreign individuals who work for the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and details about <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> operations with foreign intelligence services. Also included would be material about <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> intelligence collection on terrorism and efforts to locate hostages; and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> covert activities other than military support for the Contras; and names of non-Central American countries that supported the Contras. Unless <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> approves the agreement, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> agree `` it will be impossible ... to protect against disclosure of classified information that is of vital importance to the national security and the foreign relations of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` The trial could not go forward in this state of uncertainty,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said in a motion that outlined the government's proposed order. Referring to the nine areas of material on which the proposal would impose tight controls, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said that `` these open-ended, amorphous categories would guarantee that the trial would be a constant bench conference, not a real trial.'' If <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> rejects the government's proposed order, Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, acting on concerns of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence community, might file an affidavit with the court objecting to disclosure of classified material on grounds it would harm national security. Under the Classified Information Procedures Act, the judge would then be required to bar disclosure, which could lead to the dismissal of some or all charges in the case, depending on the scope of the affidavit. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> suggested that <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> is supporting the proposed order because he `` apparently does not want to take the political heat associated with filing an affidavit that could result in sanctions affecting the triability of the case.'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said that `` it is understandable that if the case is untriable, the attorney general would rather blame someone other than the Administration.'' The court filings by <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> came hours after <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> sent the jury home and scheduled a hearing for Tuesday on the proposed agreement for additional national security safeguards that could allow the case to go forward. The proposed agreement ends a dispute between <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> which began last Wednesday, when the department began seeking an order that would impose tight restrictions on classified material that <PERSON> North </PERSON> wanted to present at trial. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> rejected the proposal and accepted more moderate controls offered by <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, who said he wanted to proceed with the trial immediately. On Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> went to court to try to delay the trial. The department said it had concluded, and that <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> concurred, that `` the trial could not go forward without an additional protective order.'' It was n't known how quickly <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>, who scheduled a hearing for Tuesday, would rule on the motion. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday was granted an administrative stay of the trial by Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON>, with the full <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to meet Friday to consider the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s request to delay the trial Hours later, the department and <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> announced their proposed agreement, saying that if <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> approves it, the department will ask that <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON>'s stay be vacated. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said that without an additional protective order, `` it will be impossible during the defense's opening statement and presentation of evidence to protect against the unnecessary and uncontrolled disclosure of classified information.'' The department said that `` an enormous number'' of the 300 classified documents North may use at his trial `` are not yet clearly covered by a protective order of the court.''

<TEXT>
 The officer whose shooting of a black motorcyclist touched off three days of racial violence last month formally pleaded innocent Monday while his attorney said evidence showed it was a case of self defense. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>, 29, is free on bond on two manslaughter counts in the Jan. 16 shooting death of the motorcycle driver, <PERSON> Clement </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>, 23, and in the death of his passenger, <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>, 24, who suffered severe head trauma in a crash following the shooting. <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, unsuccessfully sought a delay in the trial Monday because of the racially charged atmosphere in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, and indicated he may seek to have the trial moved to another city. The trial was set for June 19. <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>, accompanied by his wife, refused to talk when he left the courthouse, but <PERSON> Black </PERSON> attacked the case. The evidence shows <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> `` shot as the motorcycle was about to hit him, that he only shot to use justifiable force in self-defense,'' the attorney said. `` If this had been explained to people immediately that night, I think there would have been a lot less disturbances here in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>.'' The three nights of rioting that followed the shooting left one person dead, 11 wounded by gunfire and 13 structures burned down. Black produced autopsy reports showing the bullet entered the front of <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> head, and said the medical examiner found that the victim had not only been drinking, but had used cocaine shortly before his death. Quoting from a statement by <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>'s partner, <ORGANIZATION> Officer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dawn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Black </PERSON> sought to show the Colombian-born policeman had no choice but to shoot when <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> raced his machine down the wrong side of the street. `` ` The motorcycle was traveling at 70 miles an hour right at him. By the time he looked up it was right in front of him. This guy was coming directly at him. He started on the line and then he comes over like that in the southbound lane. If he would have moved, the guy would have moved too, in my opinion,''' <PERSON> Black </PERSON> read from Ms. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>'s statement. Many in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s Colombian community have rallied in support of <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>, and about 25 people picketed outside the courtroom Monday demanding he be given a fair trial. <PERSON> Black </PERSON> questioned how he could investigate the case, saying any effort to question witnesses in the <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION> neighborhood where the shooting occurred could begin the disturbances all over again. Leaders in the black community disputed that view, however. `` I know there are ways they can get the information that they need to conduct the trial,'' said <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>. `` And we just want a speedy trial to get this behind us so we can go on and rebuild our community.''

The meeting Wednesday and Thursday of the 33-nation organization in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> was called by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> after the Dec. 21 air disaster over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, when a bomb blew apart a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747.

 Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> will begin a five-nation tour of the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> this week aimed at achieving a `` tangible breakthrough'' in settling the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict, an official said. <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> Perfiliev </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> will visit <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> on Feb. 17-19; <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> on Feb. 19; <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> on Feb. 20-22, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> on Feb. 23-25 and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on Feb. 25-27. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s visit is evidence of an increasing Soviet role in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. The last time a Soviet foreign minister visited <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> was in 1975, when <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> held the post. According to <PERSON> Perfiliev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s trip `` will take place in the framework of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s consistent efforts to achieve a comprehensive and just settlement in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, taking into account the interests of all people involved.'' `` We seek to attain a tangible breakthrough in settling this old conflict,'' he said, without elaborating.

<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> said Monday it is readying a series of laws in the human rights field, including freedom of the press and the right to leave the country. `` We are trying to implement fully our legislation in accordance with international standards,'' said <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanevski </PERSON>, the Soviet chief delegate to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are well aware that only by guaranteeing human rights and freedoms can we open up the whole potential of our society,'' he said in a speech in the 40-nation commission. Only by such guarantees, he said, can the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> `` improve the standards of living and quality of life of the people, solve the tasks of the environment and move science and technology forward.'' He said measures already adopted over a short period of time `` shall improve the situation of the people in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in a broad range of areas.'' Among the measures he mentioned were new provisions `` ensuring the right of the mentally ill'' and the `` opening of new monasteries and churches.'' `` Soon there will be another series of laws,'' he said. `` These have to do with the areas of freedom of conscience, of information and the press, -LRB- of -RRB- social organizations, and -LRB- of -RRB- entry and exit into and from the country.'' Reform of the Soviet criminal code also is being prepared, he said. `` Additional guarantees which will exclude the possibility of prosecution for political and religious convictions are also under way.'' In a brief interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Stanevski </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> `` probably'' would join a key human rights protocol that would allow its citizens to turn invidually to a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> body if they feel wronged. It would give the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> the right to examine the complaints and take the matter up with the Soviet government. Only about one fourth of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> member nations have ratified that `` Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,'' which is a binding instrument under international law. Most countries, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, are reluctant to join the protocol, which went into effect in 1976.

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Representatives of the Solidarity trade union and the government reported sharp differences Monday after a meeting of a working group devoted to solving <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s economic problems. At issue was whether a government plan to attack the economic crisis would be adopted by the working group as the basis for its deliberations. Solidarity considers the plan drafted by the government of Prime Minister <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> a `` good declaration of intentions,'' but short on specifics, Solidarity spokesman <PERSON> Janusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON> said at a news conference. The opposition has not offered a reasonable alternative to the plan, said Industry Minister <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilczek </PERSON>, speaking at a separate news conference. The working group on the economy, which includes representatives from the opposition, the government and the official trade union alliance OPZZ, is part a broad series of negotiations known as the `` round table'' that began Feb. 6. Other working groups are meeting on issues of political reforms and trade union freedoms, and the whole series of negotiations is expected to last three to five more weeks. Solidarity activist <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> said Deputy Prime Minister <PERSON> Irenuesz </PERSON> <PERSON> Sekula </PERSON> displayed a `` really worrying'' tone at the talks that `` indicates that the government still has a monopoly in implementing economic reforms.'' A government spokesman, <PERSON> Zbyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Rykowski </PERSON>, characterized the talks Monday as `` rather difficult'' and `` exchanges of monologues'' rather than a discussion. `` The economic debate is so vast that so far it is hard to put some order into it,'' he said. <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON> expressed wariness, but said that, `` Our hopes are not quite blown yet.'' `` It seem that the authorities would like to obtain our stamp -LRB- of approval -RRB- under decisions that have already been made. We have been and will be careful about it,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> on Monday issued final regulations for non-prescription sleep-aid products that allow use of most of their active ingredients but bans other ingredients not proved safe and effective. The major sleep-aid products already meet the new standard and few changes will have to be made in product labeling, <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> officials said. The regulations are not much different from the agency's tentative recommendations on sleeping-aid ingredients issued in June 1978, said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>, a reviewing pharmacist with the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s division of over-the-counter drug The regulations, to be published in Tuesday's Federal Register, will take effect in one year. They were developed as part of the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s review of all non-prescription drugs, which began in 1972. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> standard allows use of diphenhydramine hydrochloride and diphenhydramine citrate, contained in the sleep-aid products Compoz, <LOCATION> Nervine </LOCATION>, Nytol, Sleep-eze-3, Sleepinal, Sominex and Sominex-2, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said. The agency also said approval of doxylamine succinate will remain in effect. That ingredient is in <LOCATION> Unisom </LOCATION>, Doxysom and Ultra Sleep. Not permitted are pyrilamine maleate, potassium bromide, sodium bromide and scopolamine hydrobromide. Products containing these ingredients must be reformulated, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>, in its tentative finding 10 years ago, had recommended banning these four ingredients unless they could be proved safe and effective, and as a result many sleeping-aid manufacturers stopped using them, <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> said. Claims on sleeping-aid product labels, substantially the same as those in the tentative recommendations, may include: helps you fall asleep if you have difficulty falling asleep; for relief of occasional sleeplessness; and helps to reduce difficulty falling asleep. Warning labels will have to be changed to add to the list of medical conditions that if present indicate the product should not be used. The new labels must warn against taking the product if you have asthma glaucoma, emphysema, chronic pulmonary disease, shortness of breath, difficulty in breathing or difficulty in urination due to enlargement of the prostate gland, unless directed by a doctor. The new labels also strengthen the caution involving alcohol, advising people to avoid alcoholic beverages while taking the product. It also advises against taking the product if also taking sedatives or tranquilizers, without consulting a doctor first.

The council is to preside over the country's return to civil rule in 1992. In recent months, there have been growing complaints about the rising cost of living in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s most populous nation, and labor unions have threatened nationwide strikes to protest government-ordered cuts in fringe benefits and salaries.

 A Canadian real estate investor began operating <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> on Monday, but did not reveal his long-range plans for the Christian retreat abandoned by <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> nearly two years ago. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON>, who bought <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s assets in December for $ 65 million, will operate <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> jointly with bankruptcy trustee M.C. `` Red'' <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> until the closing on the sale _ at least 30 days away. <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Coffin </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, said Monday that no `` major'' changes are planned until after <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON> closes on the property. He also said operations at the theme park, including the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> television show, went on as usual during <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON>'s first day of operation. <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON> will need <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>'s approval for actions he takes at the theme park, `` but that wo n't be a problem,'' <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said, indicating <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON> would pay for any changes he wants to make. The new owner plans to visit <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> once a week for the next couple of weeks, and have up to three of his own employees working full-time at <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON> was expected to be at <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> on Monday, but <PERSON> Coffin </PERSON> was not sure when he would would arrive. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON> has given no indication he plans to sell <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s assets. The <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> ministry filed for bankruptcy reorganization in June 1987. The non-profit ministry arm that includes <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> is separate from <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s assets, which include two 500-room hotels, one unfinished, a water park, a television network and the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> property. The Rev. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, pastor of the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, said the church submitted a proposal to <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON> about 10 days ago offering to buy the television network, other facilities and some undeveloped property. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> also said relocating the non-profit ministry arm is `` under serious consideration,'' and a move hinges on <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON>'s plans The lure of <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> is the Christian theme, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said, and relocating <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> would make the retreat less attractive. `` The reason people come is of course the spritual reason. ... They've come to get their spiritual batteries recharged,'' he said. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> would not say how much he offered <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON>, but he said the church is financially healthy, with $ 5 million in the bank. The joint management of <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> is the latest chapter in changes at <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s Christian retreat since <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> resigned in March 1987 amid revelations he had a sexual encounter with former church secretary <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> and paid her hush money. <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON> sees <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> as a place he can turn around. <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON> bought the troubled Firestone <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> tire plant in <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, last year for the same reason, <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> said. `` He looks at what he sees as a general malaise, and he always looks for the potential,'' <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON>, 34, has a garbage disposal company, landfill site, waste water treatment business and travel company, <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> said.

 An off-duty police officer banged a rifle butt on his floor to make a downstairs neighbor turn down his loud music, and ended up shooting his upstairs neighbor in the leg, police said. The incident was being investigated by police internal affairs and the major crimes squad, but so far police consider the shooting an accident, said police spokesman <PERSON> Vince </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>. `` There's no animosity from the people upstairs,'' <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> said. `` They were real understanding _ as understanding as someone could be.'' Officer <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Haskins </PERSON>, 29, told investigators he was awakened by the music about 6:30 a.m. Saturday and endured it for 45 minutes before grabbing a <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> .223 - caliber assault rifle from under his bed, police <PERSON> Haskins </PERSON>, a firearms training assistant, said he thought the gun was unloaded when he struck the butt on the floor, but the rifle fired and a bullet went through his ceiling into the apartment above, <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingman </PERSON>, 29, told police he was sleeping when he heard a `` firecracker-type noise,'' and then realized he had been shot in the leg. He underwent surgery at <ORGANIZATION> Erlanger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and was released Sunday.

 Big gifts and guilt sometimes go hand in hand, warns a psychologist taking aim at Cupids bearing surprisingly large or expensive Valentine's Day gifts. When someone is either falling out of love or already has done so, and is feeling guilty, `` sometimes they not only give a gift _ they go overboard,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>, a professor of psychology at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION>. A $ 2.50 card from someone who customarily sends a more modest greeting can be a tip-off. `` Superficially, gifts are always nice. But gifts can be given for the wrong reason _ flattery, ingratiation, wanting to get something from you, or guilt,'' <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> said. So how can one tell if a nice gift on Valentine's Day is a sign cupid is on the mark or off target? `` If this person has not done this in the past, and comes up with a big gift, that's something that needs to be thought about,'' he said. `` It could be either a sign of falling in love again or of feeling guilty.''

 Jilted lovers or angry spouses can turn to an East Dallas florist to deliver dead Valentine's Day floral arrangements to their unloved ones complete with a visit from a black-robed Grim Reaper. `` Some people have wanted us to send <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>' flytrap or poison ivy with the dead flowers _ or just by itself,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, owner of Balloon-o-grams @ Drop Dead Florists. `` But we do n't want to get into trouble for doing that.'' Dead flowers in a ceramic skull with a plastic snake poking through an eye cost about $ 38. For a personal delivery by the Grim Reaper, its an extra $ 10. Mrs. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> incorporated the dead flower service into her store several months ago. `` I was hoping this would be popular, but I did n't realize there was this much demand for this type of thing.'' She said she plans to open stores in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>. She'll have competition in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> from <ORGANIZATION> Hate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which offers three `` hate-o-grams:'' dead flowers, candy boxes full of rocks and a ribbon-trimmed box containing a dead fish.

 Cupids wanting their Valentine's Day messages to come from <LOCATION> Bliss </LOCATION> have sent more than 600 envelopes to the postmaster here for special hand postmarks. Good Housekeeping magazine was at least partially responsible for the red tide when it listed <PERSON> Bliss </PERSON> among a half dozen <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> post offices that could provide `` a postmark as loving as the message inside.'' `` It surprised me. It made me feel good,'' said Postmaster <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Barber </PERSON>, who subscribes to the magazine. She kept right on feeling good when the envelopes started pouring into the tiny upstate hamlet around mid-January. Cupids send their stamped valentine in a separate envelope to the postmaster and request that it be postmarked and forwarded to its final destination. `` Ninety-one is my record for one day. They came from most every state, and they went out to most every state,'' she said. `` One went to <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, one to <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Arens: Negotiations Should Be With Jordan, Not PLO</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN ALT POWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> told a skeptical group of Jews on Monday that peace talks involving Palestinians should be held with <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, not the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. An aide to Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, meanwhile, outlined a peace plan that calls for Palestinians in the occupied lands to halt the 14-month uprising in exchange for elections and negotiations. But the aide, <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben-Aharon </PERSON>, also ruled out talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. A Palestinian was killed and two others were wounded in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> when an explosive device detonated after it was picked up, the army said. It said it was checking reports by hospitals and family members that two <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> children were hurt in a blast in a nearby village. In the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, troops opened fire on stone-throwing Palestinians in the <LOCATION> Rafah </LOCATION> refugee camp. Three Palestinians were wounded, including two teen-agers struck in the head with rubber-coated metal bullets. In a speech in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sephardi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> argued that <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> was a predominantly <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state and that peace negotiations should be held with King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>. `` If you want to address the Palestinian problem, you have to talk to <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>,'' he said. <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> said talking with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> would only jeopardize peace efforts. `` We'll simply strenghten extremism, encourage violence, and show that terrorism pays off,'' he said. But the <ORGANIZATION> Sephardi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, a liberal organization of Jews whose families came from Arab countries, issued a statement urging <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to `` take risks for peace'' that could include negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> is said to be developing a proposal to present when he visits the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in March or April. <PERSON> Ben-Aharon </PERSON> said it would not include talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. `` With the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> there is nothing to talk about, because we will not agree to the existence of a second Arab state ... west of the <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> river,'' he said. He called for an end to the uprising. `` Secondly, a formula for direct negotiations has to exist,'' he said. `` At a certain point, free elections will have to be held in order to determine the representation that will decide the fate of our Arab neighbors'' in the territories. He said <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> should be a partner to the settlement. Since the Palestinian uprising began, at least 380 Palestinians have been killed, most as a result of army gunfire. Fifteen Israelis also have died. In a report released last week, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> criticized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for the way it had responded to the revolt, saying many deaths could have been avoided. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> made his first public comment on the report Monday when he told the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> parliament the army `` has behaved and continues to behave gritting its teeth against violence and provocations like the <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` We have nothing to hide because we are not embarrassed over what we are doing,'' he said. An army spokeswoman said a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> man was killed Monday and two others wounded in a field near the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Kabatiya </LOCATION> when `` they found a suspicious object, played with it and it exploded.'' The spokeswoman, who could not be identified under army regulations, identified the dead man as <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kabatiya </LOCATION>. She said there was no information on the inured. Doctors at nearby <LOCATION> Jenin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> said they treated two <LOCATION> Kabatiya </LOCATION> teen-agers for shrapnel wounds from the blast. Soldiers cordoned off the site and investigators were trying to determine whether the explosive fell from an aircraft or was left after an army training exercise, an Arab reporter said. In <LOCATION> Tayasir </LOCATION>, about 10 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Kabatiya </LOCATION>, two children were reported hurt in an explosion. Doctors and family members interviewed at <ORGANIZATION> Al-Ittihad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> identified the children as <PERSON> Iktimal </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON>, 4, and her brother, <PERSON> Naim </PERSON>, 10. Family members said they heard an explosion and found the children on the ground. <PERSON> Iktimal </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> later was transferred to <LOCATION> Mukassad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, where she was reported in critical condition with head wounds. <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said it was not known what exploded but quoted family members as saying there were no <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers or civilians in the area at the time of the blast.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Say </PERSON> sent a letter through the media Friday to her brother <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, the hostage held longest in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, urging him to be strong and expressing hope President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will try to obtain his freedom. `` Stay strong little brother _ this too will pass,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Say </PERSON> wrote to the journalist, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985. `` I have great hopes that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will work for a new and better relationship between our people and our brothers in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>.'' The letter was sent from <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, where Mrs. Say is visiting. It was hoped <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> newspapers would get it to <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s captors by publishing it on her birthday Wednesday `` My heart feels very close to you on this day,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Say </PERSON> wrote. `` I came to celebrate my 48th birthday by being close to you and praying for your strength and freedom. I will go home much older, much sadder and much wiser than when I began this journey four years ago.'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 41, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, was abducted in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jihad </LOCATION>, believed to be made up of Shiite Moslem zealots loyal to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, claimed responsibility. He and eight other Americans are among 15 foreign hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Mrs. Say flew to <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> on Monday to meet with <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> officials who have cooperated with efforts to obtain the release of hostages. In her letter, she said she thanked to President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Fadalallah </PERSON>, spiritual guide of the Lebanese Shiite group <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, believed to be an umbrella organization for those holding hostages. `` I have sent messages of gratitude to <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> for their intense and complicated efforts to free the hostages,'' the letter said. `` Our country and others are working very hard to bring this situation to a happy ending.'' <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> is believed to have been instrumental in the release of French and West German hostages last year, acting as mediator among <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, the kidnappers and countries whose nationals were held. <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>'s government has good relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and was its only major <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> ally in the 8-year-war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> suspended by a cease-fire last August. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> also has 40,000 soldiers in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and is its main power broker after nearly 14 years of sectarian civil war. In her leter to <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, Mrs. Say mentioned a visit Friday to one of the world's oldest churches, where she prayed for his release, better U.S.-Syrian relations and peace in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. She hung a bracelet engraved with his name on a cross on the altar of the <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> Sergius near <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>. It was built about 300 years after <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>'s death in <LOCATION> Maaloula </LOCATION>, whose villagers still speak his language, Aramaic. `` I placed a bracelet with your name on the altar at <LOCATION> Maaloula </LOCATION> and prayed there for a healing of our personal wounds, and for the healing of the wounds between our country and the countries of the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>,'' Mrs. Say wrote. `` I also prayed for peace for the people of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and freedom for those who live in bondage as you do.'' His sister assured <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> his two daughters, teen-age <PERSON> Gabriella </PERSON> and 3-year-old Sulome, born after his abduction, were in good health. `` Your beautiful children are fine and send their love as does our family,'' she said. `` Your many friends and thousands of people in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> work and pray every hour, every day for strength and freedom for you and all the hostages.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Lansbury </PERSON>, whose high-rated `` Murder, She Wrote'' is one of the few bright spots on third-place <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' schedule, has agreed to stay with the network for another year, though not necessarily in the same show. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> announced Monday that negotiations for another season of the top-10 hour drama are continuing, but that Miss <PERSON> Lansbury </PERSON> has agreed to star in at least 13 episodes of a new half-hour show on CBS the season after `` Murder, She Wrote'' ends its run. `` Murder, She Wrote,'' in which Miss <PERSON> Lansbury </PERSON>, 63, plays a shrewd but grandmotherly mystery writer who gets involved in murder cases, is in its fifth season, after which Miss <PERSON> Lansbury </PERSON> had planned to quit. Under the new pact, Miss <PERSON> Lansbury </PERSON>'s company, <ORGANIZATION> Corymore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productions </ORGANIZATION>, operated by her sons <PERSON> David </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, will produce the half-hour show and two made-for-TV movies for <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> over the next three years. Miss <PERSON> Lansbury </PERSON> will star in at least one of the movies. The <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> reported last week that Miss <PERSON> Lansbury </PERSON> and the rest of the `` Murder, She Wrote'' crew had long grumbled about penny-pinching by the network, which had undertaken a last-ditch campaign to keep the show for at least another year. Miss <PERSON> Lansbury </PERSON> and crew celebrated the show's 100th episode in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> on Sunday, the day before the new <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> deal was announced. `` I'm so proud of the show and I have so much a sense of accomplishment of having remained in the top 10,'' Miss <PERSON> Lansbury </PERSON> said at the bash. Miss <PERSON> Lansbury </PERSON> said she was eager to continue with CBS if contractual hurdles could be cleared, adding, `` it's awfully hard to walk away from success and leave an audience that's so dependent on the show.'' `` Murder, She Wrote'' draws an estimated 40 million viewers a week and is a linchpin in CBS' successful Sunday night lineup. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> is similarly dependent on `` The Cosby Show'' as an anchor for its top-10 Thursday night lineup and managed to eke another year out of star <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON>, who, like <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Lansbury </PERSON>, had planned to quit his show after this season. Miss <PERSON> Lansbury </PERSON> is a four-time Tony Award winner for her roles in the Broadway plays `` Mame,'' `` Dear World,'' `` Gypsy'' and `` <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON> <PERSON> Todd </PERSON>.'' She has also appeared in such films as `` National Velvet,'' `` The Long, Hot Summer'' and `` The Manchurian Candidate.''

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said Monday that a <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> company will donate $ 600,000 to three medical associations to settle complaints of false advertising. The <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nutrition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> signed a consent decree under which it pledged not to make false or unsubstantiated claims about its products. Signing the decree is not an admission of any violations. Violation of its terms can mean a fine of $ 10,000. The commission said the company made false and unsubstantiated claims that its `` Healthy Greens'' diet supplement was effective in reducing the risk of cancer. Also, the commission said, the company falsely claimed that six other supplements, mainly sold to body builders, promoted weight loss, increased muscle growth and slowed aging. The consent order was approved by a 3-1 vote. Commissioner <PERSON> Margot </PERSON> <PERSON> Machol </PERSON> did not participate. The dissenter, Commissioner <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcuenaga </PERSON>, said the order left the company `` free to sell products it knows are deceptively labeled.'' The money will be split among the American <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diabetes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, a lawyer handling the case in the commission's <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> office, said such required donations were rare but had been used in the past Such a remedy was chosen, he said, because, `` it would be extraordinarily difficult or impossible to identify the people who had bought this stuff'' and should get refunds.

While the federal decision did not rule out state charges against Ms. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Assistant State Attorney <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenbaum </PERSON> said his office had no such plans. `` If they ca n't get <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> back, how are we going to?'' he said. Initial police reports claimed Miss <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> set the blaze, which killed an 82-year-old man and a 76-year-old woman, after arguing with <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> was detained briefly after the fire as a material witness but was then freed to go back to <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> said prosecutors can ask the British government to make <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> available for depositions, but added the process was long and complicated. As soon as <PERSON> Ryskamp </PERSON> dismissed the indictment Monday, Miss <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> sprang from her chair and pointed an accusing finger at her prosecutor, Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindsey </PERSON>. `` Next time, make sure you have proof,'' she said angrily. The judge discharged her $ 100,000 bond and returned her passport and other documents. `` All she wants to do is get on a plane to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and get back to her home in <LOCATION> Surrey </LOCATION>,'' said her attorney, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharpstein </PERSON>. He attacked the case as unfair from the outset. `` This has been an irresponsible and embarrassing prosecution from day one,'' <PERSON> Sharpstein </PERSON> said. `` However, a possible result is that it shows that the American justice system works.'' The government contention that <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>'s refusal to testify prompted the dismissal was just a `` red herring,'' <PERSON> Sharpstein </PERSON> said. Miss <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> was charged under an infrequently used federal arson statute making it illegal to set fires in establishments doing interstate business.

 State television showed the ceremonial departure from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> of some of the last Soviet soldiers Monday and praised what the soldiers had done, but it did not mention the misgivings some expressed. It said they were the last <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> soldiers in the Afghan capital. But others remained after the plane left, and a colonel said they would be gone by Wednesday, the deadline for Soviet withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The evening television news program `` Vremya'' began its international segment with videotape from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and the border town of <LOCATION> Termez </LOCATION> in what has become a nightly ritual as the pullout nears its end. Media reports generally praise the soldiers for `` fulfilling their internationalist duty'' in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and stress the themes of patriotism and heroism. Soviet soldiers were shown at the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> airport Monday standing in front of transport planes and a crowd of foreign reporters. The troops, the broadcast said, had helped distribute food to the capital, which has suffered shortages as anti-government guerrillas enforce a blockade. `` It occurs to me that this will not be forgotten by the thousands of women, old women and children of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>,'' the `` Vremya'' correspondent said. The correspondent then interviewed <PERSON> Vyacheslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryabinin </PERSON>, the last soldier at the airport to board a Soviet plane for home. He said he had served one year and four months and was looking forward to rejoining his relatives in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The soldiers then were shown boarding a transport plane and flying home. `` After a command, the last Soviet soldiers of the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> garrison scaled the ramp,'' the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said in an upbeat report. `` Ryabinin waved his hand and the metal door of the plane was closed. The liner took off, heading for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' Neither the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> nor `` Vremya'' reports mentioned the misgivings some soldiers have expressed after the nine-year Soviet intervention. One 20-year-old paratrooper told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> at the airport before departing: `` I think it could have been done peacefully. I think it was a big mistake.'' He did not give his name. Wednesday is the deadline in a U.N.-mediated accord for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to have all its troops out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The Kremlin sent more than 100,000 soldiers into the country in December 1979. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said Monday that more than 3,000 soldiers a day were streaming through the Soviet border towns of <LOCATION> Termez </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kushka </LOCATION>. `` Vremya'' showed armored personnel carriers carrying red flags crossing into the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Termez </LOCATION>. Women carrying red roses and red carnations stood waiting for their loved ones. The correspondent said World War II veterans were among those welcoming the returning soldiers.

<HEAD>City Affirmative Action Plan Faces Legal Challenge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHELLE LOCKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A requirement that construction firms working for the city give some of their business to minority subcontractors was challenged in court Monday, in what may be the first test of a recent <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling on affirmative action. <ORGANIZATION> Fairview </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION>, which lost a contract to build a police station due to the requirement, has challenged the constitutionality of the plan based on the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling last month that struck down a similar `` set aside'' program in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Suffolk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuttle </PERSON> on Monday allowed lawyers for <LOCATION> Fairview </LOCATION> to amend their previously filed lawsuit to include the constitutional question on the minority issue But city attorneys said they will try to get the affirmative action issue dismissed. <PERSON> Tuttle </PERSON> set another pre-trial hearing for March 7. `` There are very similar things in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s program to what the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> held unconstitutional in the <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> decision,'' said <LOCATION> Fairview </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinlan </PERSON> before Monday's hearing. Attorneys for the city argued that the <LOCATION> Fairview </LOCATION> contract was rejected because of a bidding irregularity and did not hinge on the minority requirements. But the lawsuit's amendment did appear to open the door to the constitutional question, said <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallis </PERSON>, city assistant corporation counsel. `` It seems to be that that issue is in the case. How it gets resolved in the case remains to be seen,'' <PERSON> Wallis </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, minority firms were guaranteed 30 percent of city contracts. In <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, the requirement is 15 percent, except in areas determined to have a high percentage of minorities, where the requirement is 30 percent. Justice <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O </PERSON> <PERSON> ` </PERSON> <PERSON> Connor </PERSON>, writing for the majority in the Jan. 23 decision, said construction set-asides can be enacted only with specific proof that there has been past race discrimination in the construction industry and if there is no other `` race-neutral'' remedy. <PERSON> Tuttle </PERSON>'s decision will be confined to <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, but the case has national implications as cities wait to see how the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling will be interpreted, attorneys said. Thirty-six states and nearly 200 local governments have programs that set quotas, goals or require good faith efforts to enlist minority participation, said <PERSON> Benna </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>, an attorney who represents the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayors </ORGANIZATION> and five other organizations. The significance of the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> case is that it comes so soon after the high court's ruling, <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> said. `` Whenever you have a major ruling like the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision in the <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> case it does not answer all of the questions,'' <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> said. `` That is why that process of evaluation of the decision by other courts in the context of reviewing other plans is so important.'' <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> officials say they believe their program will hold up. The legal challenge stemmed from a dispute dating back to last fall when <LOCATION> Fairview </LOCATION> came in with the low bid to building the police station, but lost the contract after <ORGANIZATION> Sciaba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> protested that sections of the <LOCATION> Fairview </LOCATION> bid did not meet the city's minority business rules. <LOCATION> Fairview </LOCATION> filed suit in December 1988, charging they should not have been denied the contract, which involves about $ 2.5 million, <PERSON> Wallis </PERSON> said. Last week, <LOCATION> Fairview </LOCATION> filed a motion asking that their case include the claim that the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> plan is unconstitutional. `` -LRB- The amendment -RRB- is a last ditch effort to try to get this contract by <LOCATION> Fairview </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Sciaba </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Spignesi </PERSON>. City Councillor <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolling </PERSON>, author of the ordinance, said he believes the plan would meet the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> test because it was based on the findings of a public hearing into discrimination in the construction business.

 Police on Monday killed an alleged Moslem fundamentalist leader of the outlawed Jihad organization, which was blamed for killing President <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> in 1981 and a failed coup attempt, police said. A police source said on condition of anonymity that <PERSON> Maged </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Oteify </PERSON> was shot Monday night on a busy downtown street. The source said <PERSON> Oteify </PERSON>, 35, was a Jihad leader who had eluded police for a long time. The source said police ambushed <PERSON> Oteify </PERSON> as he walked out of a hospital on <LOCATION> Galaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>. When he tried to escape, they shot him and later found he was armed with a hand revolver, the source said. Five Jihad members were sentenced to death for <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>'s assassination, 17 others were given prison terms and two were acquitted In a later trial, 300 Jihad members were accused of trying to overthrow the government after the assassination. The court sentenced 107 to various prison sentences, but acquitted the rest. Egyptian officials said 87 people, including 66 policemen, were killed in the attempted coup.

<TEXT>
 The second-ranking official of the <ORGANIZATION> Laborers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, identified by a presidential commission as having close ties to organized crime, retired Monday and was replaced by his son. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Coia </PERSON>, the union's secretary treasurer, announced his retirement at the union's annual Executive Council session in <LOCATION> Bal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbour </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Coia </PERSON>, regional manager for the Laborers in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and eastern <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, was immediately tapped to succeed his father Both men were mentioned in the 1986 report of the President's <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Organized Crime, which said the union had `` clear ties to organized crime. The elder <PERSON> Coia </PERSON>, 75, once was indicted on racketeering charges for allegedly accepting payoffs in return for steering union insurance business to selected companies. But the case was dismissed because the charges were filed after the statute of limitations had expired. The report, citing congressional investigations of organized crime influence on organized labor, also accused <PERSON> Coia </PERSON> and his son of involvement in schemes to bilk union health and welfare funds. The younger <PERSON> Coia </PERSON>, in a telephone interview, said both he and his father were `` unfairly characterized'' in the report and had no dealings with the mob. `` The mention of me and my father in that presidential commission report is really not a detailed and fair representation,'' he said. `` The so-called link to organized crime does not exist.'' The report also criticized internal union election policies, including the provision that allowed the younger <PERSON> Coia </PERSON>, 45, to be tapped to succeed his father. The Laborers union holds its convention every five years, when delegates elect candidates to the Executive Council on an at-large basis. If board vacancies occur between conventions, the remaining board members choose a replacement, a policy the report said `` leaves few offices contested.'' `` When the use of violence and intimidation are added, the membership has little opportunity to express itself dramatically,'' the presidential report said. The hearings on which the report was based included testimony that the elder <PERSON> Coia </PERSON> also sought to convince <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, a longtime vice president of the union and one of its few black leaders, not to run for union president. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> Coia </PERSON> told him the `` Italians'' had organized the union and would always control it. The report accused the elder <PERSON> Coia </PERSON> and Laborers President <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> <PERSON> Fosco </PERSON> of abusive spending of union funds, including $ 200,000 authorized by <PERSON> Coia </PERSON> to pay for a private investigator to keep tabs on a longstanding federal investigation of the union. <PERSON> Coia </PERSON> also ordered the union to pay $ 40,000 requested by his son to cover legal fees stemming from a government investigation of the union, the report said. There has been speculation that Focso might step down from the union presidency this year, but the younger <PERSON> Coia </PERSON> discounted such talk. `` I think the rumors are all false,'' he said. The Coias both are <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> natives. The younger <PERSON> Coia </PERSON>, a labor attorney by trade, has a law practice in <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, R.I.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A private group of scholars and analysts said Monday that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal to bail out the savings and loan industry does not provide enough money or reforms. The plan, announced last week, would provide $ 90 billion to close or sell 350 insolvent <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls and meet pledges made by regulators last year in cleaning up 223 institutions. The <ORGANIZATION> Shadow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, a group of 12 financial experts from colleges and consulting and law firms, praised <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for recognizing that the S & amp; L problem is much more costly than previously acknowledged by the government. But, in a statement, it said, `` There is a strong possibility that additional thrifts which are now marginally solvent will become insolvent in the near future. Increases in interest rates may also lead to financial difficulties for many more thrift institutions.'' Meanwhile, in a separate development, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Monday took control of <ORGANIZATION> Midwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, an insolvent S & amp; L in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> was the 11th institution taken over under a program announced by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> last week. The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> plans to assume control of more than 200 S & amp; Ls, insolvent under regulatory accounting rules, over the next four to six weeks. Although government regulators will be more strictly supervising the institutions, the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> is emphasizing that all insured deposits will continue to be fully protected. <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> business professor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>, a member of the shadow regulatory committee, estimated that 800 to 850 institutions of the nation's 3,000 thrifts are `` economically insolvent'' even though regulatory accounting rules show a far smaller number. `` Any increase in interest rates is ... going to put a lot -LRB- more -RRB- institutions under water,'' said <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, a business professor at <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. The group did not offer its own figure to counter the administration's $ 90 billion estimate, but <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said the red ink could total as much as $ 130 billion. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would be wise politically to deal with the full problem now, early in his term. He also criticized the proposal to raise $ 50 billion over the next three years by selling `` off-budget'' bonds. The interest costs would be less expensive if the money were raised by borrowing directly through the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>, he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan also reorganizes the regulatory structure by giving the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the commercial bank insurance fund, the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>, more authority over savings and loans. But, <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> said the president's plan seem more aimed at `` moving boxes'' than accomplishing real reforms. The committee advocated a program of early intervention that would impose federal control when an institution weakened and force the institution to shut down before it actually became insolvent. That way, depositors would be protected and expenditures by the federal insurance funds would be rare.

<TEXT>
 Afghan guerrillas briefly resumed a council on Monday and tried to choose a Moslem government, but two important leaders did not attend and rival factions continued wrangling over shares of power. Guerrilla sources said the seven groups in the Pakistan-based guerrilla alliance were divided on who should lead an interim government in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and on apportioning the top positions. Differences also arose over including insurgent groups based in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, they said. <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> is predominantly Sunni Moslem, as are most guerrillas based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Most of the insurgents in an eight-faction coalition that operates from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> are <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> Moslem, the sect of their host country. Some spokesmen said the council, known as a shura, would resume Tuesday and would consider major issues for the first time. Others said there was little or no hope of progress. `` The whole situation is such that nothing can come out of the council,'' said a senior official, who like the others spoke on condition of anonymity. Factionalism developed immediately Friday at the inaugural session of the shura, which has been seen as the last chance for feuding guerrilla groups to compromise, and it was suspended. Insurgent leaders predict the Marxist government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> will collapse soon after the last Soviet soldiers withdraw on Wednesday. The council's job is to choose a government that would take over and arrange elections. Aides said <PERSON> Sibghatullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mojaddidi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Syed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Gailani </PERSON>, who lead two of the seven parties, did not attend the Monday meeting and leaders of the five other other parties presided over the council, which did not consider major issues. <PERSON> Mojaddidi </PERSON> did not attend because the other six parties rejected his proposal for bringing the Iranian-based guerrillas in, sources reported. A spokesman for <PERSON> Mojaddidi </PERSON> said: `` The shura is not going to work out without the Iranian-based mujahedeen,'' using the word for the guerrillas that means Islamic holy warriors. <PERSON> Gailani </PERSON> aides said he had a scheduling conflict Monday but would attend the meeting Tuesday. But guerrilla sources said that he stayed away because of an argument about who would lead the interim government. Guerrilla groups summoned the council of insurgents, Moslem scholars and officials of past Afghan governments. <PERSON> Mojaddidi </PERSON>, who now holds the rotating chairmanship of the Pakistan-based alliance, has insisted the others honor his plan to give the <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> groups in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> 100 of the more than 500 council seats and seven interim government Cabinet posts. Most Sunni guerrilla leaders say the Shiites, an estimated 15 percent of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s population, are too few to receive so many seats. About 80 percent of Afghans are Sunni. <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> representatives have said they will accept only the <PERSON> Mojaddidi </PERSON> plan, but have not carried out their threat to leave <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>. Moslem guerrillas began fighting in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> after a Communist coup in April 1968 and Soviet soldiers entered the country in December 1979, reaching an estimated total of 115,000 by May 15, 1988, when the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> began withdrawing under a U.N.-mediated agreement. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and other countries have helped arm and finance the guerrillas.

Her career was launched in the 1960s as the lead vocalist of the Supremes, and she says she has a `` motherly instinct'' toward the young black singers of the 1980s. `` I love <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> -LRB- <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> said. But envy of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>'s success is what propelled her to resume her career, according to a friend who is quoted anonymously by the magazine as saying, `` <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> would be competitive with a tree.'' `` I have to be better than the best. Super-everything,'' said <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, who has kept a low stage profile since she married <PERSON> Arne </PERSON> <PERSON> Naess </PERSON>, a Norwegian tycoon, in 1985. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> gave birth to a boy in August, her fifth child, and her second son with <PERSON> Naess </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Soldiers, Armed Civilians Clash at Army Base</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Soldiers on Monday battled a small band of civilian intruders at an army base about 435 miles west of <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>, the government news agency <ORGANIZATION> Telam </ORGANIZATION> reported. It appeared to be low-key replay of the <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tablada </LOCATION> incident three weeks ago. <ORGANIZATION> Telam </ORGANIZATION> said a patrol discovered four or five civilians and opened fire at about 5:15 a.m. on the base of Weapons Battalion 141 near <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cuarto </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Cordoba </LOCATION>. Shooting continued for about 90 minutes until the civilians fled, the independent news agency <ORGANIZATION> Diarios </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> y </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Noticias </ORGANIZATION> said. Soldiers did not pursue the civilians fearing that it may have been a diversionary tactic, it said. One soldier was wounded. The attackers, whose goal and motive were not known, all escaped. On Jan. 23, about 50 armed civilians crashed through the main gate at the 3rd Infantry Regiment at <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tablada </ORGANIZATION> on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>. By the time troops recaptured the base a day later, 28 intruders, nine soldiers and two policemen had been killed. The government of President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> blamed leftist subversives for <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tablada </ORGANIZATION>. Fourteen intruders were seized and were imprisoned pending charges.

<TEXT>
 Hearings opened Monday at the World Court in a dispute between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> over the 1968 seizure of a U.S.-owned company, a court spokesman said. It is the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> case to be heard since the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration rejected a 1986 <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling ordering it to stop arming the Nicaraguan rebels known as Contras. Boston-based <ORGANIZATION> Raytheon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an electronics company and defense contractor, estimates it lost $ 6 million plus interest in the takeover of its subsidiary company <ORGANIZATION> Elettronica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sicula </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.p.A. </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON>, the legal advisor to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Raytheon </ORGANIZATION> wanted to liquidate the <LOCATION> Palermo </LOCATION>, Sicily-based manufacturer of cathode ray and vacuum tubes, but the Italian government nationalized the company to save jobs on the island plagued by unemployment. A five-judge panel is hearing the case, which is expected to continue at least until Wednesday, the court spokesman said on condition of anonymity. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration filed the suit two years ago for <ORGANIZATION> Raytheon </ORGANIZATION>, but only written arguments had been made since then. Only governments can appear before the court. Formally known as the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>, the judicial branch of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> has no enforcement powers and depends on voluntary adherence to its rulings. <PERSON> Elettronica </PERSON> <PERSON> Sicula </PERSON>, also known as ELSI, was co-owned by <ORGANIZATION> Matchlett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company not involved in the case. The Italian government said expropriation of the company in 1968 was aimed at protecting the plant's 900 jobs after <ORGANIZATION> Raytheon </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Matchlett </PERSON> disclosed their intention to shut down the concern. The judicial panel consists of the court's president, Judge <PERSON> Jose-Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruda </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, and Judges <PERSON> Shigeru </PERSON> <PERSON> Oda </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ago </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwebel </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and Sir <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. The case was filed in February 1987 after the <ORGANIZATION> Reagan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> rejected as invalid a <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling in July 1986 ordering the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to stop arming rebel forces attempting to overthrow <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist government. In apparent anticipation of that adverse ruling, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had withdrawn in March 1984 its recognition of the unlimited jurisdiction of the court, but said it would continue to accept the court's authority in cases not connected with the Central American issue. The <ORGANIZATION> ELSI </ORGANIZATION> case is the third one filed at the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in a decade. In 1979, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> asked the court to order the release by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> of 52 American diplomats held hostage in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. The court, on an emergency basis, ruled weeks later that the hostages should be released. They were ultimately freed in 1981. In the same year, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> jointly asked the court to draw the boundary between the two nations in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> off <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. That dispute was decided in 1984.

 Actor <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> felt a bit old when he joined fellow `` Lawrence of Arabia'' star <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> and director Sir <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lean </PERSON> for the local premiere of the restored 1962 Oscar winner. <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> watched himself ride across desert sands in his role as <PERSON> Sherif </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> in the restored three-hour, 40-minute director's cut of the movie, which won seven Academy Awards. `` It's like a veterans' reunion _ everyone's limping along and has pot bellies,'' <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> said after the screening Sunday night. `` I feel very nostalgic because I have n't seen it for 27 years,'' he said. `` It's like re-seeing your youth.'' The `` Lawrence'' premiere followed similar galas a week ago in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The screenings and banquets benefited <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> and its campaign to restore and preserve classic films. Lean, 80, urged <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> to take risks to make quality films. `` Spend some money on risky subjects,'' <PERSON> Lean </PERSON> said. `` It's no good being safe in this business. We've all got to be gamblers.'' Lean called the late <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON>, who produced `` Lawrence,'' `` one of the last of the great gamblers that have disappeared,'' but also criticized him for chopping the film. Lean's original version was cut by nearly 30 minutes shortly after the film's release. Lean contends <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> made the first cuts behind his back, but others have questioned Lean's version. An additional 15 minutes was removed when `` Lawrence'' was reissued in 1971. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Toole </PERSON>, who portrayed T.E. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, did n't attend the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> premiere. But the screening drew composer <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarre </PERSON>, film editor <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Coates </PERSON> and cinematographer <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> A. Young. All three, along with Lean, won Oscars for the film, which won as best picture of 1962.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> caught a football tossed by <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, who called himself `` a kinder, gentler quarterback'' after being formally sworn in Monday as the new Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made the first visit by a president to the Housing and <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> since <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> a dozen years ago to watch as his former rival for the Republican presidential nomination was administered the oath of office by <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Jack </PERSON>'s a man of ideas, and I've made clear I want him to apply his creativity and energy to the area of housing and urban policy, which are one of the most important and challenging issues in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> today,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` These problems require a compassionate strategy, and that's the reason I thought of <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> immediately and asked him to take this job.'' The references to football were frequent as <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, the former professional football quarterback, invited a pair of friends to join him for the ceremony _ <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Redskins </ORGANIZATION> coach <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Upshaw </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Football </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Players </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> brought a football and tossed it to <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, who tossed it to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as hundreds of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> employees watched. There were no incompletions, but the passes hardly covered one yard. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, who left the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> after 18 years, an `` all-pro congressman'' and `` a great quarterback'' at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, thanking <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for his remarks, said, `` I particularly liked the part, Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, about a kinder, gentler quarterback.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said his administration will push for urban enterprise zones, using tax incentives to encourage job-creating business in inner cities, and look for innovative ways to improve public housing and make home ownership available to its tenants. `` I believe that given a chance, economic freedom can bring a revival to the inner city, and it can create jobs and housing and dignity for every citizen,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> pledged to `` help end the appalling tragedy of homelessness,'' and to expand the number of eligible families receiving `` housing assistance and housing opportunities.'' `` Our mission is to inject oxygen and seed corn and new life and new hope into those distressed inner cities,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said. Although the ceremony was held to swear in the new secretary, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> has been on the job for a week. He received the oath privately from the department's general counsel following his unanimous confirmation by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>.

 Moslem students marched in several cities Monday against a book fundamentalists say blasphemes Islam. Their rallies occurred the day after police fired on protesters in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, killing five and wounding 83. Prime Minister <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> said the protest Sunday may have been the work of politicians using Moslem objections to <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s novel `` The Satanic Verses'' as an excuse to press their opposition to her government and democracy. In <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> on Monday, police fired into a crowd protesting the book in <LOCATION> Srinagar </LOCATION>, summer capital of northern <LOCATION> Jammu-Kashmir </LOCATION> state, killing one person and wounding more than 60, news reports said. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> said the mob forced shops and businesses in <LOCATION> Srinagar </LOCATION> to close. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, which is overwhelmingly Hindu, banned the book in October. In a letter soon after the banning, published on front pages of major Indian newspapers, <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> said: `` The right to freedom of expression is at the very foundation of any democratic society. `` When ... self-appointed guardians of <ORGANIZATION> Muslim </ORGANIZATION> sensibilities say that no civilized society should permit the publication of a book like mine, they have got things backwards. The question raised by the book's banning is precisely whether <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, by behaving in this somewhat South African fashion, can any more lay claim to the title of civilized society.''. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> to Moslem parents and lives in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, hundreds of riot police were stationed around the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, scene of Sunday's confrontation, but no trouble was reported Monday. Nearly 3,000 Moslem fundamentalists assembled outside the center Sunday to demand that <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s novel be banned in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It has been published in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other Western countries, and several Islamic countries have banned it. Fundamentalists say the book does not recognize <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION> as the one true religion and ridicules the most precious Moslem beliefs. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> declares it to be a work of fiction, in no way blasphemous and not intended to offend anyone. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> said she did not see how Sunday's protest could have been against the book because it is banned and unavailable in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, and none of the protesters could have read it. `` Was the demonstration against <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s book or a law-and-order situation?'' she said at an airport news conference after returning Monday from a state visit to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats closed the information center and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> at midday Monday after reports that more violece might occur. In adjacent <LOCATION> Rawalpindi </LOCATION>, where most shops were closed to mourn those killed the day before, about 300 Moslem theology students and opposition politicians chanted `` <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> should hang!'' and other slogans against Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>. Witnesses said small groups of young men hurled stones at shops which that remained open. There were no reports of injuries. Demonstrations were held at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consulates in <LOCATION> Lahore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Karachi </LOCATION>, but reports said police were out in force and prevented violence. At the American center in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, which houses a library and offices of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, a diplomat said: `` The staff is traumatized.'' Three Americans and 15 Pakistani employees were inside the building when a mob chanting `` American Dogs!'' and `` Allah Is Great!'' pelted the building with stones, tore down the American flag and started several small fires. Police responded with tear gas first, then fired rifles and shotguns. All the dead suffered gunshot wounds, hospital sources said. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> was visiting <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Official Pakistani media quoted her as blaming the bloodshed on a combination of a conspiracy against her government and improper police action. The official English-language newspaper <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> Times, said in a front-page editorial, `` It is hard to see how -LRB- the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> -RRB- became the prime object of mob anger in the present case when both the author and the first publication of the book belonged elsewhere.'' It suggested right-wing opponents of Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> used the issue to embarrass her government. `` A blasphemous book, even if the government had nothing to do with it other than strongly denouncing it, could have been seen by some as an opportunity for mounting a popular uproar that could also in some way be made to affect the government on the rebound,'' the paper said. American diplomats said they did not know why the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> became the target. An embassy statement Monday said `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government in no way supports or associates itself with any activity that is in any sense offensive or insulting to Islam or any other religion.'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>: `` The government and the people of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have full respect for the religious beliefs of the Pakistani people ... based on constitutionally protected rights to freedom of worship and to freedom of speech, which also guarantee the expression or publication of a wide range of works, not all of which will be acceptable in every society. `` We have full confidence in and satisfaction with the actions taken by <LOCATION> Pakistani </LOCATION> authorities during this incident,'' he said of Sunday's confrontation.

 A retired Argentine police commissioner and his wife were held Monday on charges of conspiring to sell stolen paintings worth as much as $ 100 million by such masters as <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Greco </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Goya </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> officials said. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Longo </PERSON>, 53, and his wife, <PERSON> Hilda </PERSON>, 40, who have homes in <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, were held without bond in pretrial detention after being arrested last week, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said. During the investigation, <PERSON> Longo </PERSON> told an informant, posing as a dealer of stolen artworks, that 11 paintings stolen from Argentine museums were split between two groups in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, and one of the groups was composed of police officials, according to an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> affidavit. <PERSON> Longo </PERSON> told the informant that people who stole the paintings `` paid for their freedom'' by giving `` half the paintings to police officials,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> affidavit from agent <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keith </PERSON>. Some of the information in the affidavit was corroborated by taped conversations, the international law enforcement agency <ORGANIZATION> Interpol </ORGANIZATION>, and the Argentine government, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said. The Longos were arrested at the Westin Hotel on Feb. 6 after the informant set up the purchase of `` Doves and Hens,'' a masterpiece by <ORGANIZATION> Goya </ORGANIZATION>, allegedly stolen from the <ORGANIZATION> Castagnino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rosario </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, on March 24, 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said. The `` Doves and Hens'' piece was valued at $ 500,000, said <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. The worth of the 11 stolen paintings was placed between $ 50 million and $ 100 million, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Longo </PERSON> was arrested after turning over the <ORGANIZATION> Goya </ORGANIZATION> painting to an undercover agent posing as a wealthy art expert representing foreign investors, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said. His wife was arrested as she waited in a car outside.

<HEAD>Iran To Hang 70 Drug Smugglers in One Day</HEAD>

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> says it will hang 70 drug traffickers Tuesday, the highest number to be executed in one day in that nation's fierce anti-narcotics crackdown aimed at stopping the flow to at least 1 million addicts. Hard-line Prosecuter-General <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> <PERSON> Khoeiniha </PERSON> said in a recent radio interview: `` This is the end of the line. If we do not destroy them -LRB- drug smugglers -RRB- they will destroy our youths.'' Khoeiniha first gained fame in 1979 as the guiding hand behind the militant extremists who stormed the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, holding 52 hostages for 444 days. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> instituted a new law on Jan. 21 that includes the death penalty for anyone found with 30 grams -LRB- just over an ounce -RRB- of heroin or five kilograms -LRB- 11 pounds -RRB- of opium or hashish. Addicting someone else carries a 20-year sentence. The law coincided with a crackdown that put helicopter gunships into the air along the borders with <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> to track smugglers. On Jan. 16, a record 56 drug smugglers were executed. The official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, says 105 smugglers have been executed since Dec. 31. The Iranian resistance group <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Khalq </ORGANIZATION> accuses the Iranian government of creating hysteria over the drug problem as a means of extending a siege mentality and eliminating its enemies following the 8-year Iran-Iraq war. An <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> report on Tuesday's executions said 10 will be hanged in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and the rest in cities throughout <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Executions were suspended during a 10-day celebration that ended Feb. 11 to mark the 10th anniversary of the revolution that toppled the late <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> in 1979. Iranian police released statistics Monday saying 3,300 drug traffickers have been arrested in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> since 1987 and 11 metric tons of opium, 1,540 pounds of heroin and 2.3 metric tons of hashish seized. Drug addicts now have six months to kick the habit or face jail. Addiction is not considered a medical problem in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The prosecutor-general said: `` If an addict's decision to give up his habit is serious he needs nothing else. They should not expect the government to treat them as patients.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has blamed everyone from underground opposition movements to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> for trying to turn Iranian youth into addicts. Iranians leaving the country said many youths turned to drugs to escape the intense pressure they faced to conform to Islamic principals as <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was reborn as a fundamentalist state. The draft in the `` holy war'' against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> was another factor, they said. Iranian press reports concentrate on ways of eliminating drug supplies rather than the cause of addiction. <PERSON> Khoeiniha </PERSON> said one way around the death penalty was to turn others in. `` If they -LRB- smugglers -RRB- report themselves, repent, name old traders and cooperate with discovering the rings certainly we will request the great leader -LRB- <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> -RRB- to grant them parole. Otherwise ... they will be punished according to the law.'' In other developments in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on Monday: _ Parliament Speaker <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> denied in an interview allegations of a power struggle within <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s top leadership, and dismissed reports in world media of mass executions of political opponents, <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio reported The radio, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> responded to a question from a <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION> journalist asking about reports from <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> that more than 1,000 political foes were executed since summer. _ <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> announced it planned to free 260 disabled or ailing <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> prisoners of war next week, <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio said in another report In <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Cornelio </PERSON> <PERSON> Sommaruga </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> expressed concern about the slow repatriation of prisoners and said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> were not fulfilling their international obligations. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials estimate the number of war prisoners in both countries at 100,000.

<HEAD>Immigration Service Regains Access to Asylum Center</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BROWNSVILLE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge on Monday overrode local authorities and ordered the reopening of a refugee processing center that was padlocked last week as a health and fire hazard. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Filemon </PERSON> <PERSON> Vela </PERSON> set aside at least temporarily an order Friday by a state district judge that had barred the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> from using the center in <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION>. `` There's between 200 and 300 people outside there right now waiting to be processed,'' <PERSON> Omer </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sewell </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> director in <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION>, 25 miles north of this border city, said shortly after the court action. Later, he said immigration officials regained access to the building and planned to begin seeing applicants again Tuesday morning. More than 2,000 people a week, most from <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, have been applying for political asylum at the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION> office. Many of the applicants have camped near the building while waiting for their paperwork to be processed. City officials, who had sued in state district court to be allowed to padlock the center, said they would comply with <PERSON> Vela </PERSON>'s order once they've seen it `` As far as I am concerned, it -LRB- the center -RRB- is still closed. I have not been served -LRB- with <PERSON> Vela </PERSON>'s order -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Gavino </PERSON> <PERSON> Sotelo </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION> city manager. `` The conditions at the center remain the same as they were before. There is trash, there is human waste. If this goes on, we might have to close it all over again.'' <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Card </PERSON> said once the center is open, the city will regularly inspect it and will notify <PERSON> Sewell </PERSON> of any violations found. `` We just want to make sure that the facility is operated properly. If it had been operated in a responsible way before, it would have never been closed,'' Card said. <PERSON> Sewell </PERSON> said barring the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> from the building in <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION> would have created another crisis of homeless Central Americans in the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. The last such crisis led <PERSON> Vela </PERSON> to issue an order Jan. 9 to force the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> to allow the applicants to pursue their cases at their intended <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> destination after checking in with the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION>. Huge crowds also gathered at the building when it was used for processing those who applied for amnesty under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. The current backlog involves the immigration policy that calls for refugee status for those found to be fleeing for political reasons, but deportation for undocumented aliens entering for economic reasons. In overturning a Friday order by state District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, <PERSON> Vela </PERSON> said it `` prohibits the functions and operations of an agency of the federal government.'' <PERSON> Vela </PERSON> also barred <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION> officials from restricting <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> access to the 9,872-square-foot former furniture store and from interfering with <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> business there `` in any manner whatsoever.'' He said, however, that his order should not be interpreted to mean the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> does not have to comply with state or local laws or ordinances related to public health and fire safety.

<HEAD>North Lawyer Says Reagan Involved in Helping Contra-Supporting Nations</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Subs 7th graf to show Reagan attorney declining comment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` participated personally and directly'' in giving favored treatment to countries that supported the Contras in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, lawyers for <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> said in a court filing aimed at having charges against their client dropped. North attorney <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, opposing a compromise between the independent counsel and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said in court papers released Monday that the proposed deal on keeping certain secrets out of the trial would prevent him from introducing this evidence which he said was central to <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s defense. He also criticized Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> for declining `` to take the political heat'' and make a separate secrets-protecting move that could lead to charges being thrown out. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said, `` At the heart of this case are the quid pro quo and other third-country arrangements with which the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration obtained military support for the resistance during the so-called Boland Amendments, and the policy that those third-country arrangements would not be disclosed outside a limited group of executive branch officials.'' The Boland amendments, passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, restricted and at times prohibited the spending of federal funds in support of the guerrilla war against the leftist government in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Former National Security Adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> testified at the congressional Iran-Contra hearings in 1987 that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> favored making up for that lack of official <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support with money from other nations. But the assertion that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was personally involved in arranging to return the favors is new. <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>, an attorney for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, declined comment on <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s filing after its contents were described to him. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s statements were in a written response to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>, objecting to a new plan for protecting national security secrets at <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s trial. The plan, worked out by independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, `` would gut the defense and guarantee a ` cuckoo-clock' trial,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. It would hide `` critical information about the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's third-country arrangements for military support of the resistance and the official nondisclosure of those arrangements.'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said that the way the government proposed to present this information to the jury _ through a general `` admission'' with no details allowed _ would leave out `` that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and top executive branch officials participated personally and directly in those arrangements.'' He said under the government proposal, the jury would never hear about `` direct personal participation in the third-country arrangements'' by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and these officials of his administration: National Security Adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>'s predecessor; Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>; Secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON>; Chairman of the Joint Chiefs <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON>, and the late CIA Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> Most of the details of the proposed court agreement were kept secret, but their intent was to establish nine specific categories of information that can not be revealed by <PERSON> North </PERSON> in his defense. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> urged that <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> reject the proposed rules out of hand. The proposed agreement between <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> is a compromise to deal with <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> objections that rules under which the trial was to be conducted would allow <PERSON> North </PERSON> to disclose important national security information. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> is to conduct a hearing on the agreement Tuesday. The beginning of the trial was put on hold Sunday when Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> granted the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s request for a stay. However, the department has said it will ask <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> to lift the stay if <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> approves the agreement on testimony involving classified information. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said in his court filing, `` If imposed by the court, the stipulation could cripple the defense of this case. ... We can not adequately defend this case without this information.'' He also attacked <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> for not using an avenue open to him for stopping classified information from coming out _ filing an affidavit under the Classified Information Procedures Act. Such an affidavit would force the judge to bar the information and could result in dismissal of some or all of the 12 criminal charges against North. `` The attorney general apparently does not want to take the political heat associated with filing an affidavit that could result in sanctions afffecting the triability of the case, even though he has a clear duty to protect the national security,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. `` It is understandable that if the case is untriable, the attorney general would rather blame someone other than the administration.'' Last month, two major counts against <PERSON> North </PERSON> were dismissed after <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> refused on national security grounds to allow the use of classified material deemed essential in the case. Reacting to <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s comments, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> aide, said the attorney general `` has been in public life more than 20 years. He's never been unwilling to take political heat if the cause is just.'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said in his new filing that the proposed Walsh-Thornburgh agreement `` would guarantee a ` cuckoo-clock' trial that would make a mockery of the adversarial process.'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> has promised he wo n't hold a `` cuckoo-clock'' trial _ meaning he does n't want constant interruptions at the trial for challenges on whether a document can be disclosed. With the issue of national security disclosures still unsettled Monday morning, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> sent the jurors home, telling them to check by telephone for their next court date. The nine proposed categories of secret material that ca n't be used include information that would identify undercover <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> officers, the locations of <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> stations, identities of foreign individuals who work for the spy agency and details about <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> operations with foreign intelligence services. Also included would be material about <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> intelligence collection on terrorism and eforts to locate hostages, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> covert activities other than military support for the Contras, and names of non-Central American countries that supported the Contras. Instances of quid pro quo efforts involving <PERSON> North </PERSON> surfaced in the Iran-Contra congressional hearings. For example, on March 5, 1985, he proposed that <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> be rewarded for its assistance in providing false end-user certificates so that more than 98,000 pounds of East European munitions could be delivered by chartered aircraft from a European arms dealer to a Central American country for the Contras. In a memo to <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, then the national security adviser, <PERSON> North </PERSON> suggested that the secretaries of state and defense and <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON> of the joint chiefs be asked to grant <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> additional security assistance. The purpose of the memo, said <PERSON> North </PERSON>, was to `` find a way by which we can compensate'' <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> `` for the extraordinary assistance they are providing to the Nicaraguan freedom fighters.'' <PERSON> North </PERSON> said he was attaching `` end-user certificates'' which <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> `` provided for the purchase of nearly $ 8M worth of munitions to be delivered'' to the Contras. There was no indication what became of <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s request.

 Three black men have signed statements saying <PERSON> Winnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> was `` involved in the events'' the night her bodyguards abducted and beat them, their lawyer said Monday. Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, a black activist and the wife of jailed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, denies the allegations. Her daughter, <PERSON> Zindzi </PERSON>, was quoted Monday as saying Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> will sue the Sunday Star, an anti-apartheid newspaper that reported she helped whip the victims. The men, aged 20 to 29, were released from Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s home after community leaders intervened. The three earlier had been identified as being teen-agers. A fourth youth, 14-year-old <PERSON> Moeketsi </PERSON> `` Stompie'' <PERSON> Seipei </PERSON>, is missing and feared dead. Prominent anti-apartheid lawyer <PERSON> Geoff </PERSON> <PERSON> Budlender </PERSON> said his three clients are considering legal action. The three `` say they were abducted _ three of them and <PERSON> Stompie </PERSON> _ and they were all assaulted on the first night. They say she -LRB- Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> -RRB- was involved in the events on the first night,'' said <PERSON> Budlender </PERSON>. `` They say <PERSON> Stompie </PERSON> was removed from them a day or two afterward and they never saw him again.'' He declined to elaborate, saying his clients have not authorized him to release details of the statements they gave him. Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, 54, has denied she was at home when the bodyguards, known as the <ORGANIZATION> Mandela </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> soccer team, brought the four there late last month. But she also has defended the bodyguards, saying they took the four from a <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> residence to protect them from sexual abuse, a charge the church said it investigated and found false. <PERSON> Krish </PERSON> <PERSON> Naidoo </PERSON>, an attorney who has been acting for Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, said Monday he no longer will represent her. `` I felt it was not within the scope of my work to deal with the Mandela crisis,'' he was quoted as saying by the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The Weekly Mail, another anti-apartheid newspaper, broke the story two weeks ago with accusations the released men made at a community meeting. Community leaders have appealed for the boy's return Dr. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Asvat </PERSON>, a well-known anti-apartheid physician, reportedly saw the beaten boy at the <LOCATION> Mandela </LOCATION> home `` and warned that <PERSON> Stompie </PERSON> had been so badly assaulted that he would not live,'' the Sunday Star reported. The next day, <PERSON> Asvat </PERSON> was shot and killed at his Soweto office by two young men pretending to be patients. Police are investigating whether the killing is linked. Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> says she does not know what has happened to the 14-year-old. The boy's mother says she believes he is dead. The Weekly Mail reported Friday his body was found, but police say they have no information about it. <PERSON> Zindzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> was quoted Monday as saying her mother would hold a news conference after meeting with her husband, who is held at a house on a prison farm near <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. The independent <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> also quoted <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> as saying her mother plans to sue The Sunday Star and The Weekly Mail. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> is serving a life sentence for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the government.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> resistance leader Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> says peace talks opening Feb. 19 will fail because the pro-Vietnamese government in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> has imposed unacceptable conditions, the resistance radio reported Monday. The Voice of the Khmer, monitored in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, quoted <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> as saying government opposition to deploying an international peace-keeping force in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> would allow the return of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> regime, which killed hundreds of thousands of people in 1975-78. The Phnom Penh government, which <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> installed after invading the country in December 1978, also rejected <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s demand that it be dismantled and join a provisional government that would supervise a general election. These issues are to be discussed at a second round of peace talks planned for <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>'s capital, <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION>, starting Sunday. The talks will bring together communist <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>; the Cambodian government of Premier <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>, and the three-party resistance coalition, including <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s group; the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, and the non-communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> of former Cambodian Premier Son <PERSON> Sann </PERSON>. Other Southeast Asian nations also will take part. According to the resistance radio, <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> recently said in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> that the talks `` would not be successful because the resistance forces can not just submit themselves to the Vietnamese colonialist regime as required by <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>'s conditions.'' <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> `` affirmed that more than anything else, he wants peace for the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> people,'' the broadcast said. `` But peace without independence is worthless.'' <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> has said he will not attend the <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION> talks because <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> rejected his peace proposals. But his son Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Ranariddh </PERSON> will represent him. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, widely expected to take a leading role in any future Cambodian government, is at his home in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The Chinese arm the resistance against the Soviet-supplied Vietnamese. The radio said the prince had no plans to meet President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who visits <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> late this month, or with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who is due there in mid-May. But <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> said he was ready to meet them anytime, if asked, the broadcast said. A Thai army official meanwhile disclosed Monday that more than 7,000 Cambodian refugees who were evacuated from two Khmer Rouge-run camps because of heavy shelling from across the Cambodian border have returned to their camps at Ta <PERSON> Luan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Borai </PERSON>, just inside <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. Much of the shelling that peaked in mid-November was directed at an area just inside eastern <LOCATION> Trat </LOCATION> province, where the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> had herded about 7,000 refugees, apparently to prepare to populate strategic areas of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. Gunners in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> continued to pound <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> positions near the Thai-Cambodian border, one month after the refugees all moved back, said <PERSON> Paynai </PERSON> <PERSON> Sirirat </PERSON>, chief coordinator of the <ORGANIZATION> Displaced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Persons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION>. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> sustained heavy casualties.

 <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> on Monday accused <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> of a sea intrusion and two shootings across the border and blamed <LOCATION> U.S.-South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> military exercises for suspended reconciliation talks. Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Choi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ui </PERSON> <PERSON> Ung </PERSON>, senior North Korean delegate to the 446th meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armistice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in this truce village, demanded the annual military exercises be stopped, calling them provocations and an obstacle to talks between the communist north and the pro-Western south. The general said the intrusions occurred between Feb. 3 and 12 and were `` grave provocations.'' No injuries were reported. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, which comprises the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other Korean War allies, said one shooting incident across the border was caused by `` an accidental firing'' and that the north was already notified about it. The command promised to investigate the other alleged incidents. <PERSON> Choi </PERSON> blamed the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> for the suspension of Friday's scheduled parliamentary meeting in the same location. <PERSON> Pyognyang </PERSON> unilaterally boycotted the meeting, saying the joint exercises called Team Spirit were offensive and preparations for a nuclear war against the north. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Rear Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pendley </PERSON>, speaking for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, said the north was using Team Spirit as an excuse, but he did not elaborate. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has called for removal of all 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops stationed in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> under a mutual defense pact. <PERSON> Pendley </PERSON> also renewed his command's previous demand that <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> return all <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> remains from the 1950-53 Korean War that `` you have publicly acknowledged that you are holding.'' Allied officials said the war remains included at least those of two Americans. There was no North Korean response in the two hour-meeting. The admiral renewed his command's perennial offer to invite North Koreans to come to the south and observe Team Spirit. The North did not respond as in the past. The exercises were reported to have begun last week but there was no official confirmation. The north also demanded an end to Team Spirit on Wednesday, when government officials from both <PERSON> Koreas </PERSON> met in <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> to discuss plans for the two Koreas' first meeting of prime ministers. No progress was made because of the north's refusal to take up procedural matters unless the south agreed to end Team Spirit.

 <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> should move ahead with plans to develop the nation's first commercial spaceports on <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s Space Coast and in the Panhandle, Gov <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said Monday. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> told a news conference he will recommend legislation creating a Spaceport Authority to oversee the project and will include $ 10 million in his budget proposal for the effort. `` When <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> enters the space commerce industry, it should be from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>,'' the governor said, adding the spaceport could make use of many existing facilities at <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION> and the Kennedy Space Center. `` Here in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> we are uniquely positioned to serve as <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s launching pad,'' he said. `` We have the time, we have the place, we have the talent, and we have the resources.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> appeared with <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> and said the federal government fully supports the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> effort, as well as similar efforts being pushed by <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> is leading in many aspects of the competition,'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said. `` The state that provides the money and effort to make this work will get the most government support.'' A <LOCATION> Spaceport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> study says that a facility for launching small rockets that carry instruments to take various scientific soundings should be built at <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Blas </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joe </LOCATION> in the Panhandle's <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. It also recommends two potential sites near the Kennedy Space Center _ <ORGANIZATION> Cape </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canaveral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION>, using three inactive launch pads once used for Atlas and Titan missiles, and the abandoned town of <LOCATION> Shiloh </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said he is directing the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> to take steps to develop the facility at <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Blas </LOCATION> and to determine which of the two sites near the Kennedy Space Center would be best for launching large payloads into orbit. The study estimated the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Blas </LOCATION> site could be developed for about $ 200,000 and could be open in nine to 12 weeks. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> once launched sounding rockets and many facilities are still available. According to the study, development of an orbital launch facilities on the east coast would require about three years. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Christi </PERSON>, project leader for <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION>, the consultant that did the study for the state, said a spaceport could be funded like an airport, through revenue bonds or corporate debt.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Alcee </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> on Monday asked the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to dismiss 16 of the 17 articles of impeachment returned against him last August by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>. The 52-year-old <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> jurist claimed in a 95-page motion that 15 of the 17 counts against him should be dismissed based on his acquittal in a 1983 trial and the length of time since then in bringing the impeachment proceedings against him. In its bill of impeachment, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> accused <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> of conspiring with a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney to receive a $ 150,000 payoff in exchange for a guarantee that two racketeers would not serve time in prison. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, the first black federal official ever to be impeached, was acquitted in a 1983 trial on that charge, but the articles of impeachment also accuse him of making false statements and fabricating evidence in that proceeding. The only article of impeachment which <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> did n't seek to have dismissed is one which accuses him of disclosing secret wiretap information in an unrelated investigation to <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, the mayor of <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. In his motion with the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> contended through attorneys that an impeachment trial on 15 of the 17 motions constitutes double jeopardy in view of his acquittal by a criminal court jury and also denies him due process because witnesses have died and records have been lost since then. The motion seeks dismissal of the final, 17th article on grounds that it is a `` catch-all'' count aimed at allowing the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to remove <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> from the bench with a finding that he is unfit even if a majority finds him innocent on each of the 16 other articles. The House has until March 3 to file a brief in reply to <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>' motion Monday No date for oral arguments on the motion has been set. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> earlier this month ordered that arguments on the anticipated motions be heard by the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> even though only a 12-member panel of senators will conduct the evidence hearings, which are expected to take about six weeks.

 Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> Republican who has served in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> since 1973, said Monday that he will not seek re-election in 1990. <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, 51, told reporters at a news conference in his <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> office that he was tempted to run, but two terms is enough. `` I have never believed the great opportunity, or the greatness of this country is centered in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. `` I thought that 12 years was about the right length of time.'' <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, who served from 1973-78 as a congressman and at various times has been eyed as a candidate for president and vice president by fellow conservatives, is <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>'s senior Republican officeholder in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` I love to campaign. So heading out on the campaign trail to meet people, shake hands and make speeches would be great fun. Based on polling and the advice of friends who have offered to help, I believe I would have a good chance to be re-elected,'' he said. But <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> added, `` I have considered myself and have wanted others to think of me as a citizen legislator serving in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for a time, but always with a firm intention of returning to private life.'' He said he would remain active in politics and did not close the door on a run for the governorship. `` It's conceivable,'' he said. `` I wo n't rule it out. Who knows?'' <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> said he will devote his time to unspecified business concerns. He owns television stations in <LOCATION> Twin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pocatello </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, and is building one in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyo </LOCATION>. For years, <ORGANIZATION> Armstrong </ORGANIZATION> owned and worked at <ORGANIZATION> KOSI </ORGANIZATION>, a major radio station in the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> market. A born-again evangelical Christian, he did several commercials for a Bible study organization before his re-election in 1984. He maintains an interest in evangelical religion, he said, but he does not plan to enter what he called `` the vocational ministry.'' `` I do n't see myself in that role.'' <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> said he also would consider establishing his own foundation or think tank. His announcement means there will be a wide-open race for his seat in 1990. Republicans mentioned as possible contenders include state Sen. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Considine </PERSON>, state Rep. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Paulson </PERSON>, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Reps. <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hefley </PERSON>. <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> would not say Monday whether he planned to endorse anyone as a possible successor. On the Democratic side, former Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamm </PERSON>, who had been considered a likely candidate, announced recently he would not seek the seat, but <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Buie </PERSON> <PERSON> Seawell </PERSON> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Nighthorse </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> are believed to have a strong interest in running. Before being elected to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1978, <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> represented <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>'s 5th Congressional District, which includes <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>. Before that, he spent a decade in the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, serving as <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> majority leader from 1969-72.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> answered <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> criticism by saying Monday it was not resorting to terrorism but was resisting Israeli attacks. The commentary, carried by the Palestinian news agency <ORGANIZATION> WAFA </ORGANIZATION>, responded to remarks by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of States <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> to reporters over the weekend in <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>. The remarks appeared to be a warning that attacks by Palestinian guerrillas against Israeli civilians or soldiers, either inside or outside <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, could threaten the newly established U.S.-PLO dialogue. Israeli soldiers killed five <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas during a clash in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> on Feb. 4. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> said the guerrillas were trying to infiltrate and that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> had not abandoned attacks on Israeli targets. It urged the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to break off its dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which opened in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> on Dec. 16 after chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> renounced terrorism. The <ORGANIZATION> WAFA </ORGANIZATION> commentary accused <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> of trying to impose a double standard, `` prohibiting to the Palestinian people what it allowed the Afghan resistance.'' `` The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is not resorting to terrorism, but resistance,'' the commentary said. `` It is <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> that is practicing terrorism every day while the Palestinian people are organizing legitimate resistance against the occupation, thus exercising a right in conformance with international law and convention.'' The commentator told <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> not to try to get the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to `` abandon the resistance in order to be able to continue the U.S.-PLO dialogue.'' `` We engaged in this dialogue with the aim of finding a just solution to the Palestinian problem and to realize the inalienable rights of this people,'' the commentary said. `` The resistance and the uprising will stop only when it has achieved its legitimate rights, including that of creating a Palestinian state with <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> as its capital.''

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> was sworn in on Monday for the third time as prime minister of <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> and said his government is already establishing relations with `` our most powerful neighbor,'' the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We are an island, but we are not alone,'' said <PERSON> Manley </PERSON>, 64, who led a socialist government in the 1970s but swerved toward the political center in recent years. <PERSON> Manley </PERSON>, prime minister from 1972-80, took the oath of office in an hour-long ceremony before about 3,500 guests on the lawn of King's <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, official residence of the British governor-general, Sir <PERSON> Florizel </PERSON> <PERSON> Glasspole </PERSON>. Diplomats and other guests sat before the platform under a brilliant sun on the eastern side of the rambling, colonial-style mansion. Glasspole, as representative of Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, administered the oath with the same Bible used by the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> nation's first premier, Sir <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON>, in 1962, the year <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> gained independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> belongs to the Commonweath, the global association of former British coloniies and territories, and <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> swore allegiance to the queen `` and her heirs and successors.'' <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> won a five-year term in a landslide victory last Thursday over conservative Prime Minister <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON>, who held the office for eight years and was one of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' closest allies in the region. <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON> attended a special ecumenical `` service of national peace and unity'' Sunday to set a conciliatory tone at the outset of the new government. Violence during the three-week campaign left 13 people dead. <PERSON> Manley </PERSON>, who has said he wants to visit <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as soon as possible, told the gathering he would seek good relations with <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>'s traditional allies. `` We are already well-advanced in the establishment of our relations with the new administration which guides the affairs of our most powerful neighbor, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' he said to applause. `` She's our biggest trading partner, our largest source of tourists, with the greatest potential for foreign investment.'' He singled out <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sotirhos </PERSON> in the audience, saying he wanted to pay tribute to him `` for his even-handedness before the election and for his immensely energetic assistance once it became clear that the people of <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> had made their choice.'' On domestic matters, <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> repeated his pledge to work with <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON> in clamping down on illegal guns and drugs and in fostering unity among political factions. He warned `` there may be economic trouble on our horizon'' as a result of the costly election campaign and the aftereffects of Hurricane Gilbert, which hit the island on Sept. 12, killing 45 people and causing $ 1 billion damage. The Electoral Office had no breakdown of the popular vote, but <PERSON> Manley </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was declared the winner Thursday night with 57 percent of the unofficial tally to 43 percent for <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Jamaica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Complete but unofficial results gave <PERSON> Manley </PERSON>'s party 47 seats in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> to 13 for <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON>'s party. <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON> attended a special ecumenical service Sunday to set a conciliatory tone. Violence during the three-week campaign left 13 people dead. In contrast to the policies of his previous government, which appropriated private farms and hotels, <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> says he wants to give private enterprise a free hand in boosting production and has `` abandoned all thoughts of nationalization.'' In the 1970s, <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> sought close ties with <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> and spoke out against alleged <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> plots and capitalism, alienating the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and foreign investors and plunging <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> into economic chaos. <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> has said he would restore relations with <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> but would also restrict Cuban influence in <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> to avoid antagonizing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> has said he would honor <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>'s $ 3.8 billion foreign debt, but is seeking a new approach to reducing the burden of interest payments on developing countries. Although <PERSON> Manley </PERSON>'s term is five years, he can call the next election earlier. <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON>, 58, becomes leader of the official parliamentary opposition.

<HEAD>Rubber Seals Punctured While Awaiting Installation at Nuclear Plant</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Vandals are believed to have punctured six rubber seals that shut off water running from a <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lucie </LOCATION> nuclear plant reactor to the steam generator, authorities said Monday. The plant, near <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pierce </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s southeastern coast, was inactivated for refueling at the time and the damage was caught before the seals were installed, said <PERSON> Stacey </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Damage to the seals, which are intended to stop water flow to the generator during inspections, were discovered Feb. 7 during a pre-installation check `` There is basically little safety significance attached, but the fact that they were apparently vandalized is significant,'' said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>'s regional office in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> He said although the water going to the generator might be radioactive, any leak caused by the punctures would have been spotted immediately even if they had somehow been installed. In addition, Ms. <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> said, the rubber seal must be inflated before installation, and the punctures made that impossible. The vandalism apparently occurred during the three days before the inspection. During that time, the seals were on a loading ramp one day and in the containment building for the next two days, Ms. <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> said. `` We've interviewed a couple of dozen people that were in the area over the three-day period, and so far they have not uncovered anything,'' she said. She said the utility has written a letter to plant personnel asking for help in the investigation, but so far has identified no suspects. It was possible the seals had been damaged by accident, she said, but emphasized the company was proceeding on the assumption it was vandalism. If a suspect is identified, he or she would be subject to federal criminal charges, Ms. <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> was informed of the incident, but was not actively involved in the case, she said. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> sent an inspector to the plant after the discovery, but was now monitoring the utility's internal investigation. Ms. <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> said she did not expect the incident to hold up the restart of the 850-megawatt Unit 2, which was shut down for refueling at the end of January and should be back on line after 12 weeks. She also said the incident was not considered serious enough to cause a change in safety procedures at the plant.

 Gov. <PERSON> Gaston </PERSON> <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> on Monday proposed a `` bold and agressive'' program of cuts and said the state still has to borrow as much as $ 765 million to pay its bills, improve schools and develop economically. <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON>, making his first State of the State address, said he wants to abolish the jobs of agriculture commissioner, secretary of state and treasurer. The governor also asked for 5 percent pay raises for public school teachers and state workers. The first-term Democrat presented lawmakers with a proposed $ 1.781 billion budget for 1989-90, with budget cuts averaging 4.5 percent for all state agencies except education, health and human services. The current state budget is $ 1.464 billion. `` The program I have presented ... is bold and aggressive,'' <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> said. `` It will most assuredly bring out the critics, but it will also bring out the best in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, and in us.'' <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> defeated three-term Gov. <PERSON> Arch </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> last year in a campaign that assailed <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s financial management. A special legislative session earlier this month approved $ 392 million in tax increases to help close a growing deficit and boost the state's economy, which has been hurt by a slump in its dominant industries, especially coal <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> asked for no additional revenue other than the borrowing authority. The current projected state deficit is $ 260 million by June 30, the end of this fiscal year, and $ 376 million by next year. The borrowing would include: _ up to $ 500 million for school construction, including raising $ 120 million in bonds reissued through the 1972 Better Schools Amendment _ $ 135 million to be obtained from private lenders, possibly a consortium of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> banks. _ $ 130 million, to be repaid through tolls, as part of a plan to replace the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Turnpike with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parkway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tourism </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> proposed two constitutional amendments: one to eliminate the jobs of agriculture commissioner, secretary of state and treasurer; and one to allow cities and counties to decide on their own form of government, including the possibility of forming joint municipal-county governments or even merging two or more counties. Gubernatorial aide <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Reale </PERSON> said the proposed amendments, which must be approved by two-thirds of both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delegates </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, probably would be placed on the ballot for voter ratification in a special election this fall. The 5 percent pay raise for teachers and state employees would depend on whether the state can save $ 40 million to $ 45 million in the first six months of the 1989-90 fiscal year.

 Senior <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> held `` very friendly and nostalgic'' talks Monday with Prime Minister <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and recalled her father's friendship with past <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leaders, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s ambassador said. `` I knew your father very well,'' Ambassador <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Akram </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaki </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> as telling Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> at a 40-minute meeting in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>. The evening television news showed <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> holding his hands up palms together to greet Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> in Moslem fashion, smiling broadly as he did so. <PERSON> Zaki </PERSON> said the talks covered a general survey of Pakistani-Chinese relationship, with some reminiscences by <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> about Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s father, the late Prime Minister <PERSON> Zulfikar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> The official Chinese news agency <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> as saying: `` Your father was a friend of the late Chairman <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>. Your parents established a special relationship with the late Premier <PERSON> Chou </PERSON> <PERSON> En-lai </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Yingchao </PERSON>. I personally have had contacts with your family for a long time.'' The elder <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, president from 1971-73 and prime minister from 1973 until he was ousted in a 1976 coup and later executed, made friendship with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> a key element of his foreign policy. By choosing <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for her first official foreign trip since being elected last November, <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> sought to emphasize this longstanding tie. The two sides signed agreements to extend a trade protocol and encourage mutual investment, but expressions of friendship dominated over substance. `` The torch of Pakistan-China friendship has been passed on to a new generation who will surely ... pass -LRB- it -RRB- on to the next generation,'' <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> quoted Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> as telling <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>. `` It was a very successful visit,'' <PERSON> Zaki </PERSON> said as Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> prepared to leave <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> for home. `` The meetings with all the top-ranking leaders produced complete identity of views.'' Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> also met Monday with President <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shangkun </PERSON> and on Sunday with Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> and Communist Party General Secretary <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>. <PERSON> Zaki </PERSON> reported the 84-year-old <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> meeting `` in very good health.'' He said the Bhutto-Yang talks included the current Soviet troop withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> after 10 years and said `` both hoped... there would be a broad-based government peacefully established. He did not elaborate. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> later confirmed to Western reporters that she met in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Alaeddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Broujerdi </PERSON>, and discussed the disputes between Pakistan-based Afghan guerrillas and those based in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. She gave no details. The guerrillas, aided by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, have been fighting the Soviet-backed Afghan government since 1978. The main dispute is over sharing of power after the Soviets leave. <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and fear of Soviet ambitions in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> have been major factors in <LOCATION> Chinese-Pakistani </LOCATION> ties. Mutual hostility with <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has been another. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> recently held a fence-mending summit with <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and plans one with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in May, but relations with <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> are expected to remain close.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> vigilante group claimed responsiblility Monday for killing a prominent Roman Catholic lawyer. His widow and and Irish nationalists accused a British official of making him a target. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Finucane </PERSON>, who acted for clients involved in the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s campaign against British rule, was fatally shot Sunday night by three men who stormed his home in north <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. His wife, <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON>, was shot in the ankle but was in satisfactory condition in a hospital. Their three children were not hurt. On Monday, the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fighters </ORGANIZATION> telephoned a coded message to the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> claiming responsibility for the attack. The group said it `` shot <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Finucane </PERSON> the Provisional <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> officer, not <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Finucane </PERSON> the solicitor.'' `` While the Provisional IRA threaten and shoot Loyalist -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- construction workers ... the inevitable retaliation will take place,'' the statement said. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> has targeted workers who do maintenance and construction work for the police and British army in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Finucane </PERSON> denied her husband was an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> member. `` <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> was a solicitor -LRB- attorney -RRB- who worked for human rights and civil liberties. He defended both <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> and Protestant alike,'' she said in a statement to the British domestic news agency <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. She also criticized junior Home Office Minister <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogg </PERSON> for telling a parliamentary committee discussing an anti-terrorist bill that some <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> lawyers were `` unduly sympathetic'' to guerrilla groups. <PERSON> Hogg </PERSON>'s remarks were raised in the House of Commons on Jan. 31. `` We firmly believe that it was instrumental in <PERSON> Pat </PERSON>'s death,'' she said. <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s legal political arm, <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Hogg </PERSON>'s comment provided the `` pretext for the slaying of Mr. <PERSON> Finucane </PERSON>.'' Northern Ireland Secretary <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, the British Cabinet minister responsible for the province, said Monday he believed <PERSON> Hogg </PERSON>'s comments had nothing to do with the slaying `` Not at all,'' <PERSON> King </PERSON> said. `` I think that Mr. <PERSON> Finucane </PERSON> was well known for the work he did for the clients he had.'' In <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON> called the killing a `` particularly disturbing development'' and a `` major attack on the system of justice in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>.'' He defended lawyers in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> as acting `` conscientiously, impartially and courageously to anyone in the community who has been accused of a crime.'' <PERSON> Finucane </PERSON>, 38, was involved in the <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armagh </LOCATION> inquest into the 1983 police killings of three unarmed <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas.

<TEXT>
 The government moved Monday to issue arrest warrants for 150 employees of stock brokerage firms on charges of illegal trading related to the October 1987 stock market crash, the government news agency said. The Notimex agency quoted <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspe </PERSON> as saying he asked the federal attorney general to issue arrest warrants for employees of the Operadora de Bolsa and <ORGANIZATION> Mexicana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valores </ORGANIZATION> e Inversiones firms. The report did not say on what specific charges the arrests were being sought. An official with the office of Attorney General <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> said by telephone that no one was available to comment on the case Monday night. <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Addona </PERSON>, the fiscal attorney general, said last week the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was investigating reports of illegal trading by all but one of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s 24 registered brokerage firms. He said his department received 50 complaints of alleged fraud by stockbrokers stemming from the crash. Officials uncovered no evidence of wrongdoing on the <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in five of those cases, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is responsible for enforcing securities and tax laws, but it must ask the federal attorney general to perform any arrests of suspects. Illegal trading allegations surfaced after the October 1987 crash, when <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s market index plummeted by 74 percent in 28 trading days.

<TEXT>
 A summit of the five Central American presidents bogged down on opening day Monday in a dispute involving <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and at least two other nations over how to appraise progress toward democracy. An adviser to the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> said earlier Monday that <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> was making strong democratic commitments because it believes the rebel movement is dead. `` With the Contras' military defeat and the passing of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, the external military threat to the <LOCATION> Nicaraguan </LOCATION> government that impeded democratization is gone,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Reichler </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> lawyer employed by <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> as an adviser and representative. Later, however, foreign ministers <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Escoto </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Acevedo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> clashed publicly over whether commissions to monitor progress toward democracy should include Central Americans or foreign participants. `` We have the moral authority to select a commission of Central Americans. We should carry out our own verification,'' <PERSON> Acevedo </PERSON> told a news conference. `` It seems to us somewhat anti-democratic that it should be we ourselves who appraise our own actions,'' <PERSON> D'Escoto </PERSON> told a separate news conference. The two spoke as presidents <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Vinicio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerezo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> worked in closed session late into the first day of a two-day summit. <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> reportedly was siding with <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> in the dispute. `` They're going at each other quite harshly,'' said a member of the Nicaraguan delegation, commenting on condition of anonymity. The meeting intends to breathe new life into the stalled <LOCATION> Esquipulas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> II </LOCATION> plan designed to promote peace and demcoracy in the region. Since the presidents signed the accord in August 1987, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s regional partners _ especially <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> _ have criticized <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> for what they alleged is an authoritarian Sandinista regime. `` The political problem in the region is one of democracy _ of totalitarianism versus liberty,'' <PERSON> Acevedo </PERSON> said. Officials with the Nicaraguan delegation said <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> proposed a bilateral agreement with <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> that calls for the estimated 11,000-strong Contra force there to be disbanded. The Contras fled to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid expired last year. Under the proposal, the Contras could take advantage of an amnesty offered by the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> or go to third countries under the supervision of international organizations. The Sandinistas would release the estimated 3,500 Contras and former Nicaraguan national guardsmen now in Sandinista prisons. The officials said <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> presented the plan to <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> at the Feb. 2 inauguration of Venezuelan President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>. The five presidents first appeared encouraged by the mere fact of being under the same roof after six months of delay. The summit was rescheduled and postponed five times. `` I am sure that we, with optimism, will analyze efforts we've made according to <LOCATION> Esquipulas </LOCATION> II and search for favorable solutions that will promote peace and progress in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> said as the meeting began All the chief executives except <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, in a green army uniform, wore casual attire fitting the climate of this seaside resort 40 miles southeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. They had intended to mark the anniversary of the signing with a summit in August, but could not agree on an agenda. After some initial success, the <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> plan stalled last year. Officials said the summit's principal subject would be enforcing compliance with the injunction against using one signatory's territory as a base for attacking another, but the presidents disagree on verification mechanisms <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> is said to favor a commission of Central Americans, but Nicaraguan officials said their government wants the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> and human rights groups included on such a panel. All the presidents expressed support for the framework constructed last week by their foreign ministers in talks with <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>. The ministers want `` an impartial mechanism'' created for on-site verification of compliance. The tentative idea is to form an observer group from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>, the 1987 Nobel Peace laureate, said the summit would `` re-establish our credibility with the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people and the entire world.'' A decade of civil conflict and economic depression have transformed the region of 25 million people into a zone of turbulence. An estimated 160,000 people have been killed in wars in a decade and most Central Americans live in extreme poverty. Civil wars still plague <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> but the scale has been reduced greatly in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>. The Contras signed a preliminary cease-fire with the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> last March but <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s government stands accused of failing to make good its pledge to strengthen democratic institutions and practices. <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, the Marxist-led insurgent army, announced a two-day truce for the meeting.

 An `` excessively permissive'' attitude by institutions tends to allow careless and sometimes even fraudulent medical research, a national <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> committee reported today. The committee, empaneled to study misconduct in biomedical research, said better research standards and systematic ways of investigating laboratory irresponsibility are needed. `` Although the committee believes that serious misconduct in science is rare ... it concludes that institutions fail to detect and correct early deviant behavior primarily because of an excessively permissive research environment that tolerates careless practices,'' the committee report said. Funding pressures and an overemphasis on publication of research in scientific journals also encourage what the committee called `` substandard practices.''

<HEAD>Disappearing Partners Charged With Insurance Scam, Theft, Murder</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 If not for insurance company routine, <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> might still be dead _ and living comfortably somewhere under another name. <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> complained of chest pains last April. Dr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> came to his <LOCATION> Glendale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, office, then collapsed and died of a heart attack. <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>'s business partner, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, had the body cremated. It was n't the perfect crime, but it came `` extraordinarily close,'' <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> MacKenzie </PERSON> said Feb. 6 outside the courtroom where <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON> denied charges of murder, conspiracy, theft, insurance fraud and assault with a stun gun. <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON>, held without bail, faces the death penalty. `` If a couple of things had n't gone our way, it could really have been perfect,'' <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> police Detective <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lanfear </PERSON> said recently. <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, partners in the Columbus-based Just Sweats athletic wear chain, face the same charges in what authorities say was a plot to fake <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>'s death and collect on $ 1.5 million in life insurance while making off with up to $ 2 million embezzled from their company. `` You're talking some real serious planning here,'' said <PERSON> Lanfear </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>, 47, was arrested Jan. 29 at <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, carrying $ 14,000 in cash and 14 ID cards _ including one for the alias he allegedly assumed in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> after his `` death'' _ and the driver's license of <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>, the man who actually died in <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON>' office. <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, 25, remains at large, with $ 1 million in insurance money and $ 200,000 from company accounts, but without $ 500,000 from two other policies. `` He's lived off the streets since he was 17. He's been around He knows how to hide,'' said <PERSON> Lanfear </PERSON>, who would have preferred to catch <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> first. `` He's younger and I think he would have talked. I'm afraid <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> wo n't talk.'' The scheme, according to authorities and court records, went like this: Beginning in May 1987, <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> bought $ 1.5 million in life insurance policies from <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Mercer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, naming <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> as beneficiary. He signed a will leaving everything to <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, and directing that his body be cremated and no relatives notified of his death. In January 1988, <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> rented a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> condominium using an alias. The next month he consulted a plastic surgeon about changing his appearance, told some friends and co-workers about chest pains _ and some that he had AIDS _ then left for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, where he once had lived. <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> stripped Just Sweats accounts of as much as $ 1.8 million before he left April 15 for <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. That left the company the pair founded in 1985 with assets of $ 1.4 million and liabilities of $ 2.3 million; it filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors in August. `` I guess I can say I'm disappointed in them,'' said <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Mantz </PERSON>, the Just Sweats vice president who took control of the $ 8.5 million-a-year company after <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> gave her power of attorney in an apologetic letter saying the `` pressures of running the business have totally driven me almost crazy.'' `` I do n't think you could print what I feel deep down,'' <PERSON> Mantz </PERSON> said. On April 16, <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON> killed <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>, 32, a drifter who once lived in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. The method was unusual, <PERSON> MacKenzie </PERSON> said, declining to be more specific until a preliminary hearing scheduled for Feb. 21. <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON> called police April 16 and said <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> had collapsed and died in his office after complaining of chest pains. <LOCATION> Glendale </LOCATION> police did not question the identity and marked the case closed. The death was listed as natural. <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> the same day, using the name <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Snowden </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to claim the body. <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> collected $ 1 million from the insurance company July 8 and left <ORGANIZATION> Columbus </ORGANIZATION> about a week later after parking his car at an airport lot with the keys in the ignition. The night before, roommate <PERSON> Erik </PERSON> <PERSON> DeSando </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> `` spilled his guts,'' blurting out that <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> was n't dead and that his disappearance was insurance fraud. Law enforcement officials believe the pair used an insurance scam involving a staged robbery of furniture and paintings they were renting to bankroll Just Sweats, the Journal said. `` <PERSON> John </PERSON> was always thinking up scams,'' <PERSON> DeSando </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> underwent cosmetic surgery a month after the killing, and began using the name and identification of <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>, as well as the von <PERSON> Snowden </PERSON> alias. <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, where he used the name <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>. <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Volpi </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> private investigator hired by <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION>, turned up a von <PERSON> Snowden </PERSON> connection after he took two bags of garbage from the curb in front of a <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> condominium <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> shared with <PERSON> DeSando </PERSON>. `` It's a procedure that we use a lot more than I'd like to think about, but it's very successful. People throw out a lot of evidence with the trash,'' said <PERSON> Volpi </PERSON>, who found December 1987 telephone bills showing a call to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. He learned that the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> condo was being rented by a man who called himself <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Snowden </PERSON>. <PERSON> DeSando </PERSON> remembered seeing a note written by <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> that said: `` Distance myself from <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Snowden </PERSON> named <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> as an emergency contact and a reference on his rental application for the condo, gave as a previous address <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> apartment, the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> driver's license number he gave was <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>'s expired license, and his listed employment was as an inactive partner in Just Sweats, The <ORGANIZATION> Columbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dispatch </ORGANIZATION> reported, citing leasing records. A few weeks after the death in <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON>' office, at the request of <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION>, police obtained a copy of <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> driver's license and compared it with a photo of the dead man The license had n't been on the body, but credit cards and a birth certificate had. The resemblance was strong, but the man's thumbprint revealed him to be <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> The <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> coroner's office changed the official cause of death to undetermined, and police began to investigate a homicide. <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON> `` was tricked and bamboozled by <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> and Mr. <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>,'' defense attorney <PERSON> Sammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> said outside the neurologist's arraignment `` There's a tremendous resemblance between Mr. <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> and Mr. <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON>, 55, told the Journal that although he had seen <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> for annual check-ups for seven years, he was `` not in the business of ascertaining identifications. ... I thought I was treating <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>.'' Nine months after he supposedly died, <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> was nabbed as he returned from <LOCATION> Acapulco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, apparently to sell some property in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. He was arraigned in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> on theft charges and agreed not to fight being returned to <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, where he now is being held on $ 5 million bond. Asked by the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> judge if he could afford to post the bond, he replied: `` If they let me die a few more times, I can.''

<HEAD>Ex-Maid from Cape Verde Makes Good as Italian TV Host</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hundreds of thousands of Third World immigrants struggling to make a living in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> have found a spokeswoman and role model in a 33-year-old former maid from <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION>, the island republic off northwest <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. She is <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Lourdes </PERSON> <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s first black television anchorwoman, host of a weekly program that highlights the problems of foreigners and tries to break down racist stereotypes. `` Without a doubt it's a great responsibility,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>. `` Whoever speaks out on these problems is seen as someone who can have some influence or can do something about them. I just try to do my best within the limits of possibility.'' Her program on the state-run RAI network is called `` Non Solo Nero,'' which literally means `` not just black'' and is derived from the name of another popular show, `` Non Solo Moda,' not just fashion. The program has examined, among other things, the problems of immigrant families separated by their jobs, foreigners in jail, racially mixed marriages, sexual harassment and housing discrimination. To make its point, the show recently had a woman call to ask about an apartment advertised as being for rent. The telephone conversation was put on the air. After inquiring about the rental, the woman in the studio said: `` By the way, I'm Somalian. I hope that does n't matter.'' `` Yes it does,'' the woman on the other end said and hung up. Ms. <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> said she's received compliments from strangers in the street and numerous letters praising the program, marking what she hopes is the beginning in a change of attitudes toward immigrants. `` This program shows that we're beginning to see the fruits of the efforts of all the foreign communities in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> trying to make known their situation and the need to improve it,'' she said in an interview, sitting in her small office under an anti-racism poster. `` This is the first time a program of this type has been on the air. It's a very first step. Now people are beginning to talk about our problems and trying to confront them.'' Still, Ms. <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> said, she is not satisified with the time allotted to the program, just 15 minutes on Saturday afternoons, and complains that RAI devotes more time each week to pets. `` More time to the problems of dogs than to foreigners,'' she said. `` It's crazy.'' Since the program first went on the air in November, Ms. <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> has also been a target of the same racism she is trying to eliminate. Leaving her home one night she was taunted and cursed by a young man who recognized her from television. On another occasion, she was riding in a car with several friends, including three Italian television technicians of dark complexion, when they were stopped by police. `` They made us get out of the car, with machine guns drawn, and the first thing they said was, ` You're all foreigners, right?''' she said. `` I consider these incidents as things that happen, but I've had other, positive experiences. I have so many Italian friends. It's a very nice atmosphere.'' Ms. <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>, called <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> by her friends, was born in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION>, a former <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> colony. She moved with her family to <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>'s capital, at age 12 and three years later joined her sister in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> to work as a maid. She worked her way through high school and won a scholarship to a university, getting a degree in education. She gradually became involved in defending the cause of immigrants and formed an association to represent the 8,000 Cape Verdians living in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. When <PERSON> RAI </PERSON> decided last fall to broadcast a program on the problems of immigrants, she was a natural choice for host. Ms. <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> speaks fluent Italian with a slight Portuguese accent. The newsmagazine <PERSON> L'Espresso </PERSON> described her stylish look as that of a `` woman executive ... always elegant.'' Third World immigration is fairly new to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. There are an estimated 1 million immigrants, mostly from <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, many without legal documents. Italians, who long considered racism someone else's problem, are now confronting the issue themselves. `` Generally, Italians are apparently open, friendly and hospitable people,'' Ms. <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> said. `` But when it comes to personal and work relations, they often manifest a racist attitude, especially toward Africans. The stereotypes are amazing.'' She said she did n't notice any racism in her early years in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> because her community was closed and isolated from the outside society. But things changed when the immigrant community grew and decided to organize. `` Then you begin to realize what your concrete possibilities are, the many difficulties and the resistance,'' Ms. <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Water Tank Sculptures Capture Disappearing City Scene</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAULINE JELINEK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When archaeologists dig up <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' sculptures centuries from now, they'll find clues to yet another era that has gone down the drain. In the past month, the 35-year-old artist has created some 20 terra cotta water tanks, ranging from 2 inches to 2 feet. To <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, it's a way of commemorating the real-life rooftop towers, which to her resemble monuments to the industrial age. `` I'm a child of the city and think there is a lot of beauty to be found in the city's ugliness,'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said. But the artist's models have been disappearing, with demolition teams casting them them off the city's skyline faster than she can cast them in clay. The rooftop tanks have been here since the late 1800s, when the city was rebuilding from the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Fire of 1871. They were put on the high-rises of the time, buildings more than several stories high. The filled tanks improved water pressure and served as resevoirs from which to draw during emergencies. They were a craft in themselves, at first made like wooden barrels with tongue-and-groove seams so perfect that no extra seal was needed to hold the water. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> found the models for her art in a changing industrial area on <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Near </LOCATION> <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>. She drove there on another errand late last year and decided to get out of her car and tour on foot. `` There was a whole vista of them,'' she said. She photographed some, sketched others. She studied the tanks, trying to decide what techniques and materials she could use to reproduce the ladders, capture the colors and portray the peeling paint and weathered wood. Then, in her studio, she began constructing them, throwing clay on a potter's wheel and adding hand-built parts for tops, stilts and buildings. She fired them in a kiln and chose 10 for the show, naming some for streets where she'd seen the real tanks. But by the time the exhibit opened Jan. 20, three of the real tanks had been knocked down. `` Better water pumps have negated their use,'' said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Acker </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Plumbing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contractors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Insurance companies still discount premiums for buildings with tanks because the reservoirs provide extra protection, <PERSON> Acker </PERSON> said. But a wave of housing rehabilitation work in recent years is hastening the demise of the vessels. Old factories with tanks are being converted into town houses with more modern plumbing. Old schools are being gutted for lofts, and old housing is being made to look newer. `` Progress,'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, her exhibit will continue this month at the <ORGANIZATION> Lill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gallery </ORGANIZATION>, a studio, gallery and ceramics school housed in a building that was a horse barn when <PERSON> Lill </PERSON> <PERSON> Street </PERSON> was at the edge of the city and at the end of the trolley line. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, a teacher at the school, says so far people seem to be intrigued by the show. `` It looks stark,'' she said. `` It looks like a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> cityscape. ...'' The way it used to be.

<HEAD>A Kinder, Gentler Cliche</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Kindly, gently, and, it seems interminably, the phrase that became a <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> cliche is being used for him, against him and all around him. The president spared it another repetition in what amounted to his State of the Union address Thursday night _ he spoke of decency, compassion, generosity, government that helps people, but he skipped `` kinder and gentler.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was one of the few orators who did. `` A kinder, gentler <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>?'' House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said in the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> response to the president. `` That's the old time Democratic religion. We embrace it enthusiastically.'' There is the matter of agreeing on what it means. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said words and gestures wo n't do _ it will cost money. By Democratic reckoning, considerably more money than <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposes to spend. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> finds the phrase a handy one. `` Obviously this is not a kinder, gentler budget,'' the speaker said when President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> sent <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> his farewell spending proposal. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> adjusted spending priorities, notably by reducing the proposed <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget, but Democrats still used the K word and the G word to criticize his proposal. `` He's offering a minimum down payment on a kinder, gentler <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' said Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` But I ca n't see how he's proposing to meet the necessary installment payments. They might have to repossess his kinder, gentler <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> for failure to meet the payments.'' But <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s budget director, said the new administration's budget would, too, make the nation kinder and gentler, although perhaps not as rapidly as everyone would like. Kinder and gentler than the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration? `` Well, I'm not saying that,'' <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> replied. He said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> budget seeks more money for education, environmental cleanups, aid to the homeless, Medicaid for the needy and like programs. `` If they are marks of a ... kinder, gentler society, then it meets that test. ...'' Democratic National Chairman <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> quickly joined the oratorical game. Praising the achievements of Democratic governors, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said `` for these leaders, kinder and gentler does n't come from the pen of some ghost writer. It comes from the heart.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, installed last Friday, said the next time the administration says `` we need leadership that's kinder and gentler, I'm going to ask kinder and gentler than whom? The Republican Party?'' In 1992, chimed in <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, speaker of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, `` we will capture the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and give this nation a kinder and gentler leader.'' That crop of Ks and Gs represents only the tip of the cliche. It covers usage by a handful of political spokesmen since last Thursday. A check of <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> files turned up 140 stories using the phrase since the Nov. 8 election. It has become fodder for TV comics, promising kinder and gentler one-liners. On Groundhog Day, forecasts were for another six weeks of a kinder and gentler winter. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> used his own line repeatedly during the presidential campaign _ startling his strategists one night when he said he'd be kinder and gentler, and would stop negative campaigning against Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. By morning, he had decided otherwise. In conversation, trying to remember a man's name, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> described him as a kinder and gentler looking fellow. In the inaugural address, he declared a mission `` to make kinder the face of the nation and gentler the face of the world.'' All of this flowed from a passage in his acceptance speech last Aug. 18 at the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION>, crafted by campaign speechwriter <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Noonan </PERSON>, who should have signed up for royalties on use of the line. `` The fact is prosperity has a purpose,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` It is to allow us to pursue the better angels, to give us time to think and grow. Prosperity with a purpose means taking your idealism and making it concrete by certain acts of goodness. It means helping a child from an unhappy home learn how to read ... It means teaching troubled children through your presence that there's such a thing as reliable love. Some would say it's soft and insufficiently tough to care about these things. But where is it written that we must act as if we do not care, as if we are not moved? `` Well I am moved,'' he said. `` I want a kinder, gentler nation.'' That's the line that stuck, outlasting the cryptic thousand points of light turned on in the same speech. But after six months, it might be kinder and gentler to dream up a new catch phrase.

<HEAD>Employers Find That Crowded Hong Kong Lacks Manpower</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BIERS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The teeming streets and apartment blocks jammed one against the other suggest the last thing <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> needs is more people. But employers insist they have tens of thousands of jobs available with no one to fill them. They want the government to relax strict immigration laws so that foreign laborers can help fuel the robust economy. `` There just are n't enough people to go around,'' said <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, chairman of the 78-member <ORGANIZATION> Retail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, of the British colony's 5.7 million population. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s economy expanded 13.5 percent in 1987 and an estimated 8 percent last year, sending the unemployment rate tumbling to a negligible 1.3 percent for the three months ending in November. <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> McGregor </PERSON>, who represents business interests in the local <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, estimates that at least 100,000 more workers are needed. Business leaders say the shortage endangers future growth and forces up wages, fueling inflation, which neared 8 percent last year. The government, however, says bringing in foreigners who do not have special skills would deprive local workers of their fair share of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s economic success and could create numerous social problems. The shortage is felt in virtually every industry, from gritty construction sites to the plush corridors of the five-star tourist hotels. Employers are taking a wide variety of measures to cope. The <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Shanghai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, short nearly 300 tellers as the hectic Lunar New Year holiday approached in early February, attempted to relieve the strain on its employees by giving away two <ORGANIZATION> Porsche </ORGANIZATION> cars in a contest open only to customers who used automatic banking machines, spokeswoman Fiona-Jane <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. The new <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> angered competitors by instituting a 48-hour, five-day work week, instead of the industry standard of six days. <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Maury </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION> marketing director, said the five-day week was designed to give his hotel a `` competitive edge'' in attracting staff. `` It's done exactly what we wanted,'' he said, adding that 3,800 people applied for 1,100 openings. Meanwhile, hundreds of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> manufacturers have established plants across the border in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Guangdong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> province </LOCATION>, where wages are relatively cheap, land is available and labor is abundant. The critical construction industry has been particularly hard hit by the scarcity of labor, with the vast majority of projects failing to make completion deadlines, according to <PERSON> Gerrit </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Nys </PERSON>, chief executive of Shui On -LRB- Contractors -RRB- Ltd. The situation is exacerbated by laborers who are not working as hard, aware of how valuable a commodity they have become, de Nys said. `` If you yell and shout at them ... they wo n't even say goodbye. They'll just walk off the job.'' Shui On now tends to focus more on public sector projects because the government seems less likely to demand penalty payments for the inevitable delays, de Nys said. Compounding the personnel headache faced by de Nys and others is the loss of thousands of key professionals who are emigrating before <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> takes over the colony in 1997. While there appears to be no quick fix to stem the emigration flow, businessmen believe the labor shortage could be relieved if the government relaxed immigration restrictions that generally allow the entry of only specially skilled workers and maids. Nine major business associations have joined forces and are preparing a report on their labor needs in hopes of persuading the government to ease up on immigration. <PERSON> McGregor </PERSON>, who is involved in the project, said the government could tap <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for labor to do short-term contractual work. English-speaking workers needed in service industries could be brought in from the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> and possibly <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, he said. So far, the government has refused to budge. Secretary for Education and Manpower <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Bridge </PERSON> said in a November speech that importing workers who do not have special skills `` would be extremely damaging to our labor relations'' and reduce the incentive for employers to upgrade technology, management and productivity. Further, he said, the `` supply of housing, medical and social services and our transport facilities would be stretched even tighter,'' and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> could face international accusations of exploiting cheap labor.

<HEAD>Greek Cypriots Openin a University; Turks Already Have One</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After years of delay, the <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> community is founding a university in an effort to halt an exodus of talented students and help reunify the war-divided <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> island. But when the <ORGANIZATION> Cyprus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> opens next year, it will be competing for international recognition with a 3-year-old Turkish Cypriot university also seeking to become a prestigious higher education center. Although Greek and <LOCATION> Turkish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> educators say they want students from both communities, the island's long-running political problems make that unlikely. `` Our university will teach in both <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> and Turkish, and there'll be a department of Turkish studies,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cypriot </ORGANIZATION> education minister, <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Philippou </PERSON>, said in an interview. `` We want it to contribute to reuniting <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. We hope Turkish Cypriots will attend, but it depends on the political situation.'' Professor <PERSON> Okan </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarhan </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediterranean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> at </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Famagusta </ORGANIZATION> in the Turkish Cypriot republic in northern <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, said: `` We have students from 17 countries but no Greek Cypriots.'' <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> was unofficially partitioned in 1974 when the Turkish army invaded after an Athens-inspired coup intended to unite the island with <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. The breakaway Turkish Cypriot statelet was proclaimed in 1983 in the northern one-third of the island occupied by the Turkish forces. Reunification talks between Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders on a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> Nation-proposed bi-zonal federation resumed last fall after a three-year break but have bogged down amid traditional differences. Some Greek Cypriot officials fear that the de facto partition of the island will harden as time goes by, with new generations growing up on both sides with no contact with each other. `` <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> is a tiny place, but there's a great hunger for higher education,'' said <PERSON> Margit </PERSON> <PERSON> Schatzman </PERSON>, an American educational consultant preparing a study on the <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> universities. `` Both the Greek and Turkish Cypriot institutions are structuring their programs along mainstream Western university lines. It's clear they're both looking for international status,'' she said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>. Education Minister <PERSON> Philippou </PERSON>, a former mathematics professor at <ORGANIZATION> Patras </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, said the university plan was drawn up in three months last summer by a group of politicians and <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> academics, including professors at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and British universities `` The decision to have a university was taken almost 20 years ago but never implemented,'' he said. `` Now it must happen if we're to stop losing good people who go abroad to study.'' The Greek Cypriot university is due to open in 1990 in temporary premises with 400 students and 30 faculty and eventually grow to 4,000 students and 330 faculty members. It is budgeted to cost $ 42 million. The planners say that having a local university will save a large chunk of an estimated $ 24 million spent every year on sending 10,000 Cypriots to <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION>, British and American universities. Many start careers overseas because, with more than 50,000 graduates among the 480,000 Greek Cypriots, jobs at home are hard to find at home. The government offers free business courses to recent graduates to make them employable in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>' booming service economy, but `` with our own university we can channel people where they're needed by offering development-related courses,'' <PERSON> Philippou </PERSON> said. Young Greek Cypriots say they welcome a university because it will make <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION> livelier as well as saving family funds. `` The university will bring lots of activities, there'll be more music and cultural activities. I'm looking forward to it,'' said <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Palaiologou </PERSON>, who wants to study management. The <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cypriot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> will decide whether some courses should be taught in English. But with a business school planned, that may be essential to attract first-rate staff and students, several educators said. The <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediterranean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, where courses are taught in English, has a problem because it is in the Turkish Cypriot republic, which is recognized only by <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. `` We're an international university, but we do n't qualify for aid from any international organization,'' said <PERSON> Tarhan </PERSON>, the university's head `` I think that's unfair since we're an educational institution and not involved in politics.'' Foreigners from Arab countries, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> make up around 10 percent of its 2,300 students. The rest are Turks and Turkish Cypriots, but they also may spend a year taking intensive English classes before starting as freshmen. East Mediterranean, a former junior technical college upgraded to a university in 1986, focuses on engineering and economics. <PERSON> Tarhan </PERSON> said a business school will open and more humanities courses will be offered in the next two years.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Rafik </PERSON> <PERSON> Helou </PERSON>, a retired schoolteacher, has n't received his state pension for nearly five months. That's because he's a Christian and lives in east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and the social security office is in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, the Moslem sector He is a victim of a bizarre political crisis in long-suffering <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in which government institutions, including the army, have been split in two by rival Christian and Moslem Cabinets vying for power. The 64-year-old <PERSON> Helou </PERSON>, who has a heart ailment, has to rely on his sons to pay for medicines for himself and his wife, who suffers from diabetes. The power struggle threatens to cement the de facto partition of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Many of the country's estimated 4 million people, hardened by 14 years of civil war, have taken this bureaucratic nightmare in their stride, despite three weeks of bloody fighting between rival Shiite Moslem factions in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. But for thousands of people like <PERSON> Helou </PERSON>, it has made the daily struggle for survival even more difficult. State employees are still getting paid. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> still has gold reserves worth an estimated $ 2.5 billion stored at <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Knox </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>. But with foreign currency earnings dwindling, the central bank has turned to internal borrowing from commercial banks to supplement funds officials are able to collect in taxes, customs duties and other levies. But pensioners like <PERSON> Helou </PERSON> have suffered. The social security department's board of directors has not been able to meet to endorse pension payments because <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> officials are afraid to cross the dividing Green Line into west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Helou </PERSON> said in an interview: `` We need 30,000 Lebanese pounds -LRB- $ 60 -RRB- a month for medicines. I relied on my annual pension of 6 million pounds -LRB- $ 12,000 -RRB-, but with two governments I ca n't get it. `` Fortunately my sons are providing me with the medications for the time being. But how long can this go on?'' The crisis began Sept. 22, when President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>'s 6-year term ended without a successor being named. Minutes before he stepped down, <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> named the commander of the Christian army, Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, as the head of an interim military Cabinet until a new president was elected. Acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, a Syrian-backed Sunni Moslem, and other Moslem leaders refused to acknowledge <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. The government lost its authority long ago and real political power has rested with the heavily armed militias on both sides and their foreign allies, such as <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Yet government departments handling social and economic matters continued to function after a fashion, just enough to maintain a semblance of normality. Now even that slender thread is in jeopardy. <PERSON> Ghassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bitar </PERSON>, a Christian municipal employee, said he and his colleagues have not been paid since September. <PERSON> Bitar </PERSON>, 32, who has two children and a wife five months pregnant, said he had to turn his family <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION> into a taxi to make ends meet. `` I ca n't leave my family hungry,'' he said. <PERSON> Rana </PERSON> <PERSON> Shehab </PERSON>'s dreams of going to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to study medicine were shattered when the Education Ministry refused to issue her high school graduation certificate. `` Going to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s impossible now,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Shehab </PERSON>, an 18-year-old Moslem. `` The only alternative was to enroll in the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION>.'' The university, which once was the most prestigious education center in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, is now a shadow of that since its foreign professors were frightened off by a wave of kidnappings of its American and British lecturers and administrators. But Ms. <PERSON> Shehab </PERSON> noted: `` It's better than nothing.'' An Education Ministry official, <PERSON> Sami </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, said the authorities decided not to issue certificates for students in either west or east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> `` until the government is reunited.'' Even getting in and out of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> has become a problem for some people. `` Airport officials turned me back when they saw my passport was renewed in east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Anis </PERSON> <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON>, a Christian, when he tried to leave through the airport in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. `` I got my ticket refunded and now I'm going to take the ferry to <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> from the Christian port of <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON>, 24. The Lebanese have learned how to survive under the most arduous conditions during the civil war, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s invasion in 1982 and endless factional feuding. But the cloning of what had passed for their government has exasperated many. `` We're fed up,'' said <PERSON> Amal </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamdi </PERSON>, 28, a secretary in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. `` We want this chaos to end. However, if formal partitioning would lead to security, stability and better living conditions, let it be.'' `` Let's either have formal partition or elect a new president, but let's finish and know where we stand,'' said <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayyoub </PERSON>, 36, who works at an east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> trading company. Every government ministry now has two competing heads. The 40,000-man army, the police and municipal departments are similarly split in two. The only institution that has remained intact is the central bank, which is financing both governments. It is in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hout </PERSON>, economic adviser to bank governor <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Naim </PERSON>, said the bank's main objectivick pay. A recent study by the Swedish Employer's <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said the average Swedish worker in industry missed 27 days a year for illness in 1987, compared with 18 days in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, 16 in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and 11 in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. A recent opinion poll indicated that 86 percent of those questioned suspected their colleagues of cheating. Official statistics show that sick pay costs have increased by 50 percent over the past three years. <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s sick pay plan has traditionally been based on the honor system. Under a 1987 reform, blue-collar workers joined other wage earners in being entitled to 90 percent of their pay when they are off sick, starting from the first day they stay home. The government handles the payments, but most of the money comes from taxes paid by employers. In the Swedish system, an employee who is ill calls his <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> and later signs a form stating the nature of the illness. A doctor's certificate is required only if the worker is home for a week or more. One form of abuse is simply for an employee to call in sick when he's not. However, authorities say it's even more common for workers to file for sick pay and go to work anyway, getting sick pay in addition to regular pay. It's difficult to check. `` If I knock on the door and nobody opens, what is my proof?'' <PERSON> Yvonne </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroberg </PERSON>, a local official, said recently on Swedish television. She suggested more telephone checks with employers rather than home visits by inspectors. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> described another scheme in a report late last year. It said some people collect payments for sick leave, parental leave and student grants for the same period. <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustaf </PERSON> <PERSON> Scherer </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, said on television his organization would increase its supervision. In <LOCATION> Bandhagen </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>, the local office started a three-week campaign to check all claims on certain days. Sick leave, pensions and various other social benefits are expected to cost 20 percent of the gross national product this year. Illness benefits last year amounted to $ 5 billion, $ 120 million more than <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> paid for defense. One option under study is to let employers take over sick payments for those absent from work up to two weeks, saving the government money and paperwork. The employer would then claim a refund from the authorities. Unions have opposed the plan. <PERSON> Margareta </PERSON> <PERSON> Svensson </PERSON> at the blue-collar <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Confederation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unions </ORGANIZATION> said it would permit employers to put pressure on employees. `` There would be people who would not dare to be -LRB- off -RRB- ill if their employer controlled'' sick payments, she said. Since benefits are administered locally, there is no official overall picture of cheating nationwide. A random check by insurance offices in the west coast town of <LOCATION> Halmstad </LOCATION> indicated 20 percent of all sick claims were false, and the figure was 15 percent in neighboring <LOCATION> Varberg </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Svenska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dagbladet </ORGANIZATION> said. Another study reported by the <ORGANIZATION> Dagens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nyheter </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said a three-day check of claimants in the northern province of <LOCATION> Jamtland </LOCATION> showed all 180 cases were valid. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s report said illness claims, valid or not, varied strongly by location. The 10 districts with the highest absenteeism were low-income suburbs of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s three largest cities. The head of the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rinkeby </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> suburb inhabited mostly by immigrants, topped the list, with an absentee rate almost twice as high as the national average. `` People out here have heavy, monotonous, dangerous and boring jobs,'' said <PERSON> Gun </PERSON> <PERSON> Britt </PERSON> <PERSON> Johansson </PERSON>, head of <PERSON> Rinkeby </PERSON>'s social insurance office.

 One day last year, state government was within an hour of not making the payroll. One day in the future, economists warn, this city could be knocking on bankruptcy's door. Bond ratings are just one notch above junk bonds. Times are hard in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. Charity hospital clinics overflow because the state ca n't afford enough doctors to go around. Windows in City Hall remain cracked and unrepaired. Children go to school in packed classrooms without modern teaching aids such as computers. One town has to turn off street lights to save money. `` We have become a state of mediocrity instead of a state of excellence,'' said Commissioner of Administration <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Stine </PERSON>. `` We've become a welfare state instead of a wealthy state.'' Times are hard in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. An estimated 30,000 unskilled oil workers are unemployed; some have been out of work so long their benefits ran out long ago. Many of the state's skilled workers have fled to healthier regions. In all, close to 100,000 jobs have been lost. Even worse, antiquated laws from bygone boom days handcuff public officials' efforts to attract new business and raise the money needed to improve education, health care and the economy. French-Cajun optimism, the let-the-good-times-roll attitude that drank up boom after boom and thirsted through only occasional busts, seems to be fading. People have been packing up and moving out. No hope of another oil boom, they say. No hope. `` We seem to find people with short fuses lately,'' said <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiasson </PERSON>, the manager of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orleans </ORGANIZATION>' largest unemployment office. `` Do I really see any signs of improvement? No, I really do n't.'' Times are hard in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. The state was forced to borrow $ 1.3 billion to cover its debt, and another $ 1.2 billion to bail out its insolvent unemployment insurance fund. About 10 percent of the state tax collections now go to pay interest on debt. Sales taxes are already highest in the nation _ 9 percent in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. Businesses fear that they will be taxed to bail the state out. `` It's a spiral _ you ca n't get new business, so you ca n't employ all the people who need jobs,'' said <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, director of business and economic research at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orleans </ORGANIZATION>. `` That does n't mean we will spiral down any further, but there will be no new growth.'' In fact, there are indicators that the economy has bottomed out after two years of depression. There are no signs of improvement, however. The price of oil began its crash in 1984, and two years later a leading state business organization proclaimed that <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s recession had become a depression Unemployment reached 14.5 percent in January 1987. The latest figure is about 10 percent _ twice the national average. Despite its abundance of resources, waterway location and reputation for good food and good times, the state proved to be ill-prepared for the day when the oil `` gravy train'' stopped, economists said. The taxing structure dates back to the days of populist <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, who believed the people were entitled to a free ride at the expense of business. Most homes are exempt from property taxes; many state services are offered at unusually low rates, such as $ 3 a year for an automobile license plate. Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> tried to rearrange the fiscal structure, but his first attempt failed in the Legislature last fall. He says he'll try again, and win, because the future of the state depends on it `` We had a state where big money beat big ideas, and that's a loser. We're trying to reverse it,'' <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> said. The state has a huge group _ estimated at 30,000 _ of out-of-work oil workers with no employable skills. Most dropped out of school for the lure of big money on oil rigs. Many do n't even have the money now to pack up and move out. `` How are we going to get our present work force into jobs?'' asks <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Schreiber </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orleans </ORGANIZATION>' World Trade Center and chairman of a governor's task force on labor. `` We have to train and develop our workers.'' <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> has seen its sales tax revenue fall so far that the mayor said the only services left to cut were courts and school crossing guards. The city has lost $ 100 million in revenue _ a full one-third of its entire budget _ since oil prices crashed. `` The current budget is in a crisis,'' Mayor <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Barthelemy </PERSON> said in an interview before opting for an $ 8-per-household `` public safety fee'' and slashing court funding from $ 25 million to $ 15 million, with layoffs in the district attorney's office. But <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> law says the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> ca n't raise property taxes without a general election, and besides, only 15 percent of the homeowners in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> pay property taxes, by law. The <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> ca n't raise the sales tax, by law. It ca n't create an income tax, by law All <PERSON> Barthelemy </PERSON> says he can do is raise fees, such as slapping a surcharge on water bills for `` public safety.'' The city of <LOCATION> Shreveport </LOCATION>, in the northern part of the state, balanced its budget by laying off 115 <ORGANIZATION> Sanitation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> workers, abolishing back door garbage pickups and raising water and sewer rates 25 percent. <LOCATION> Houma </LOCATION>, an oil town near the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, found times were so hard that 3,000 street lights had to be turned off to save money. `` Business has never been as bad,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Catlett </PERSON>, owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Houma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pawn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shop </ORGANIZATION>. `` I ca n't see any improvement, and I'm usually the first to tell.'' New Orleans school Supt. <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> has had to cope with all the problems of a large, urban school system while his budget has been slashed. The state cut back on its funding, so did the federal government, and the city. He's laid off 300 employees. His teacher-pupil ratio has climbed to 29-to-1 in elementary schools. His counselor-to-pupil ratio is 450-to-1. Voters approved a bond package to help the schools, but it's not enough. This year, the schools are operating with $ 30 million in `` bridge funding'' from the state. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> is worried he'll lose that money next year. That could mean more layoffs, a shorter school year, and a budget so poor `` I really could n't operate the school district.'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, like Mayor <PERSON> Barthelemy </PERSON>, Gov. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>, economists and business leaders, says the key to the future will be reshaping the tax structure to promote new business and remove the handcuffs from local governments. Despite the element of futility, they see good times ahead. `` I am optimistic, and I guess that's how we survive,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. The governor added, `` We are going to turn this state around.''

 For one week, this jazz' n' roll city put aside its problems, polished away its tarnish, set aside its bickering, dug deep into its threadbare pockets and put on a party for the Republican National Convention. It was a celebration amidst a depression, a $ 150 million economic surge in the middle of a financial crisis. It was also a symbolic move for `` The Big Easy,'' which now, more than ever, sees its future in tourism rather than oil. `` We saw what happened during the Republican convention. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> was by far one of the premier cities in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Barthelemy </PERSON>. `` That gave me a little glimmer of what the future of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> could be.'' But the present is one of crisis. The city budget is in such shambles <PERSON> Barthelemy </PERSON> said he had to cut city funding for the courts by 40 percent this year. Unemployment remains at nearly 9 percent. A real estate group labeled <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> a place to avoid because of falling home values. And finances at City Hall are so bleak that some worry that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> may be headed for a crisis similar to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s several years ago _ knocking on bankruptcy's door `` The more likely situation is a default by the city,'' said economist <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orleans </ORGANIZATION>. `` But I do n't think that's going to happen There's a lot of work going on to avoid that.'' Part of that effort is a move to overhaul the tax structure for all of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, including <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. And part of it is <PERSON> Barthelemy </PERSON>'s push for tourism development. New Orleans draws 5 million visitors a year, and that number is climbing, according to the tourist bureau. Tourism-generated jobs have grown 38 percent over the last four years, from 37,000 to 51,000. The city is doubling the size of its convention center, building a new aquarium and looking at developing a European-style botanical garden. Family attractions are needed to offset the adults-only image of the French Quarter, the mayor said. And if it all works, there will be more than enough business to offset the collapse of the highflying oil industry. `` If you ever doubt that, go to <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> and see what the tourism has done for that city. Basically, <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> has attracted tourists, and money from tourism has developed <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>. That was basically the only industry they had,'' <PERSON> Barthelemy </PERSON> said. The mayor says the city's financial survival will be on the line in the state legislature in 1989 when plans to rewrite the state's tax structure are debated `` When times were good it was a good system because you basically had oil pay the freight,'' <PERSON> Barthelemy </PERSON> said. `` Now that's changed.'' `` It's got to be solved,'' he said. `` If it's not solved, then the city may slip beyond recognition. It's got to be solved. There is no choice.''

 P.T. <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> was a partner in an oil field boat company _ until he almost lost everything. Now he packs crabs at a brand new fish plant he started. `` I was lucky to survive with my pants on,'' he said. A lot of people in <LOCATION> Morgan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> were lucky. While most of the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> coast has been decimated by the collapse of the oil industry, <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> has been staging something of a rebound. Shipyards are hiring again and working two shifts. Fish plants, such as <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>'s, are teaching unemployed oil workers the ways of the sea. City employees got back 9 percent of a 15 percent wage cut. Sales tax collections are $ 680,000 over projections. `` We've had to make do with different things,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Cedric </PERSON> <PERSON> LaFleur </PERSON>, who has used a $ 3 million `` rainy day'' fund and profits from the city-owned utility to spark new businesses. For <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, the city built a new road so he could build his plant on a waterway. At the <ORGANIZATION> Conrad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> shipyard, employment has increased 100 percent over the last year, said general manager <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiasson </PERSON>. The firm, which used to build nothing but oil field boats, has survived by switching to construction barges, floating dry docks for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and even an excursion boat for the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>. `` We just were n't willing to give up,'' <PERSON> Chiasson </PERSON> said. `` You have to go with the flow.'' At the Wheel House Lounge, on what was once a rough-and-tumble waterfront area, patrons talk of surviving, not partying. `` There's been almost a 100 percent change in character in two years,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roe </PERSON>, the owner. `` If you're going to live down here, you're going to have to know how to be a survivor. This town survives because these people know how to survive,'' said patron <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. At the <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, the marquee recently invoked a popular song to express the community's sentiment. `` Do n't Worry, Be Happy,'' the sign said. But despite the hopeful signs, <LOCATION> Morgan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> is still wrestling with the same problems as much of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. Unemployment still runs between 10 and 11 percent. `` But hell,'' <PERSON> LaFleur </PERSON> said, `` it used to be 27 percent.'' The city has lost 1,500 people, but recently gained about 500, <PERSON> LaFleur </PERSON> said. That population loss is felt in the city's two major <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> churches, which have lost one-sixth of their families, the Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallen </PERSON> of Sacred Heart Church said. `` Most of our young people have gone to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, and places like that where there is employment,'' <PERSON> Gallen </PERSON> said. The church has started a thrift store and runs seminars on business and financial affairs, and depression. `` People seem to be cautiously optimistic,'' <PERSON> Gallen </PERSON> said. `` Remember, there are still a lot of people in business just hanging on.'' Survivors like <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, who now ships <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> crabs to <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, say they do n't miss the wild days at all. `` I've got mixed emotions about what I'm doing. I feel bitter about how much money I lost, and how I had to start over again,'' he said. And if the price of oil should skyrocket again, <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> will resist temptation and stick with fish. `` If this business goes, and I think it will, I just do n't feel confident enough in the oil industry to invest any money in it,'' he said.

<HEAD>Part II: Economic Reform Comes Hard in Populist Louisiana</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE>
<TEXT>
 When the oil and the good times were flowing, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s populist system of government seemed to make sense. Give the people a free ride and let the businesses pay. Now oil has crashed, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> has suffered through four years of economic depression, and economists say recovery is n't possible without a new system. A reformist governor is trying to do just that, but breaking with the populist past does n't come easy. This second of two parts of `` Bad Times On The Bayou'' explores this <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> revolution.

 The 34-story <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> state capitol casts a long shadow over the white marble statue of <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, but these days, it seems the statue is casting the longer shadow. `` An unconquered friend of the poor,'' the inscription on Long's adjacent tomb says, `` who dreamed of the day when the wealth of the land would be spread among the people. The populist ideas of `` the Kingfish,'' who governed from 1928-1932, still influence the fiscal structure of the state. Spread the wealth, protect the poor. Homeowners receive a $ 75,000 property tax exemption, making the average home tax free. Automobile license plates cost only $ 3 a year. City councils ca n't raise taxes without a vote of the people. Businesses bear much of the burden through taxes and fees. But the way of doing business that <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON> helped build is crippling the state now, economists say. Without the oil windfall, state and local budgets ca n't be balanced. Schools and hospitals are suffering. Unemployment has soared. And new businesses are scared away by the tax structure. `` It's ironic. What is supposed to be good for the people now acts to their detriment,'' said <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orleans </ORGANIZATION> economist <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>. Added business leader <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Schreiber </PERSON>, director of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>' World Trade Center: `` We've got to change We can not do business in the old ways. ... Painful as it is, it's forced us to wake up.'' But waking up is n't easy in the land of `` The Big Easy,'' as <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> is called. After a string of legislative victories and a fierce round of budget cutting and borrowing, Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>'s initial attempt at overhauling the tax structure failed in the state House. The Harvard-educated conservative Democrat has, in his own words, `` poked every bear in the forest'' while inciting a revolution in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. He won education reform, campaign finance reform, tort reform, worker's compensation reform, even unemployment insurance reform. But when it came to fiscal reform, when it came to dismantling the last vestiges of the populist past, <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> lost. Ca n't a family's home be the one thing that's not taxed, <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>'s opponents asked `` I believe in paying our own way. That is a break from <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> tradition,'' <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> said. `` It does n't come easy.'' Along the way, <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> is also compiling a spectrum of political enemies ranging from populists to labor unions to teachers. Public opinion polls are divided on the maverick reformer. The question remains, what happens if he ca n't complete the revolution? `` It would be more of the same. We'd be a slave to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> ... a wasteland, a welfare state,'' <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> said, adding that people with the means to move away would do so. Politicians, he said, `` are beginning to realize that.'' Fiscal reform has become the vortex of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s struggle to climb out of a depression that began when the price of oil fell by more than half in 1984-85. Tens of thousands lost jobs, and both businesses and workers left the state. And taxes on oil _ which used to account for 40 percent of the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> state budget _ plummeted. The state, long known for its big spending ways, had n't put anything aside for dry years. It had n't spent much on developing a strong economic base, outside of oil. In fact, it had n't even had a balanced budget in the 1980s until <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> took office 10 months ago _ even though it has a balanced budget law. It's debt reached $ 2 billion. `` We could not make the payroll the week after I took office,'' <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> said. Now, state promoters, planners and business leaders all buzz with talk about <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s recovery _ if there is fiscal reform. `` When the price of oil was $ 40 a barrel, hardly anybody worried,'' said <PERSON> Schreiber </PERSON>, the businessman who chaired a governor's task force on labor `` Having all these advantages made everyone in the state very lazy. <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> has not been competitive in business,'' <PERSON> Schreiber </PERSON> said. `` It's only really now that the state is pulling its act together.'' The day after reform failed last October, two companies considering <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> announced plans to build in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Other businesses considering a relocation or expansion in the Bayou State are holding off until they see if reform passes, said <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s chief of economic development, <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> Wall Street bond brokers set out informal guidelines for what would be necessary to raise the state's bond rating, currently just one notch above junk bonds. Low bond ratings means the state must pay higher interest on its debt. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> has accomplished all but one item _ fiscal reform, said his chief of staff, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON>. `` They watch us very closely,'' he said. The battle will probably be waged this spring when <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> comes back to the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> with a plan. Last time, his package passed the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, but came up 10 votes short of the necessary two-thirds margin in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. The opposition focused on <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>'s plan to cut by two-thirds the $ 75,000 homestead exemption _ the nation's highest. It was led by a county tax assessor, <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Chehardy </PERSON>, who saw reform as an attempt to raise taxes and cripple the average homeowner. `` People in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> read horror stories in other states where property taxes did go wild,'' said <PERSON> Chehardy </PERSON>. `` Government taxes everything. Ca n't there be one thing in life a person can have without being taxed?'' <PERSON> Chehardy </PERSON> says lawmakers should cut the budget, and if there are any tax increases, taxpayers should get a chance to vote. But <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> and his top aides insist the budget has been cut so much _ more than $ 500 million _ that further reductions could cripple the state. Already, they worry about the declining quality of care at state-financed charity hospitals and the ability of cities like <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> to get by without the traditional state support. And the next fiscal year budget has a projected deficit of $ 734 million. The total budget is $ 4.2 billion, but only $ 2.2 billion is discretionary spending _ money that is n't tied to court orders or debt payments. `` Cutting that much -LRB- $ 734 million -RRB- would shut more and more hospitals, cut transportation money and higher education,'' said Commissioner of Administration <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Stine </PERSON>. `` That is, in my mind, shutting down government.'' Still, the early talk of next June's budget is a revolutionary concept by itself in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, a state that at times balanced its budget for only three-quarters of the year and hoped oil prices would go up.

 Since taking office in May, Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> has balanced a state budget for the first time in the 1980s. He's steered a package of reforms through the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, including political campaign reform and education reform. Yet he lost his most important battle _ overhauling the state's populist taxing structure. Here, in excerpts from an interview with <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> regional reporter <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON>, <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> discusses his goals and concerns for <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> from his <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, office.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 Question: What are you trying to do to this state? It seems like there's a revolution going on. Answer: It really is. ... We inherited the highest unemployment rate in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and a budget that was in shambles for a variety of reasons. For example, the price of oil in last year's budget was $ 21 a barrel. Oil never saw $ 21. It was a phony figure which exasperated the deficit. We've got it -LRB- oil, which is currently around $ 17 a barrel -RRB- at $ 13.80. That's how tough we are. ... As a result, I think the business community in the state and outside of the state knows that something's happening in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. Our unemployment rate is beginning to go down. It was above 12 percent when I took office. It's now about 9.5. Q: Is it the attitudes in the state that you're bumping up against? A: We had a state, and I love <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, but we had a state where big money beat big ideas, and that's a loser. We're trying to reverse it. It's not done. We've got a ways to go. We need to rewrite our tax code to give businesses incentives to grow jobs. I tried ... I failed by a close margin. We'll try it again, and win it. When we do that, all of the ingredients will be in place. ... Watch us. I want to warn <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and the other states of the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION>. Watch us. Q: Is it fair to say what you're really doing is throwing out the past, throwing out the populist government, throwing out the legacy of <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>? A: Right, in part. I want to be fair to <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> because he had many great points. <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> built the roads in this state to tie farms to market. He gave children free textbooks. So when we say we're breaking with the past, I really do n't think of <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON> I do think of the populist strain where there's something for nothing and everybody else pays the bill. We are trying to break from that. ... I believe in paying our own way. That is a break from <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> tradition. It does n't come easy. Q: What would happen if tax reform does n't pass? A: It would be more of the same. We'd be a slave to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. We'd be a slave to how many times <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> can get together and jack the price around. We'd be a wasteland, a welfare state. Those who are without hope, those who are without means, wo n't move _ they ca n't, they're stuck. Those with an education, with financial mobility, are going to vote with their feet. They're going to leave. And for the first time the politicians are beginning to realize that. Every bear in the forest, I've poked. Now is the time to do it. There are some who think that if I do my job right, I could never get elected to another public office. Q: Do you believe it? A: Might be true. Q: Do you care? A: I do n't. ... I would be totally satisfied four years from now to prop my feet up on the desk and say, ` Well done.' Q: Do you think things can turn around that quickly? A: Yes, in terms of public perception and attitude. That's the real fight. The fight is not the unemployment rate that goes up and down with national trends and a lot of things out of our control. You'll see an improvement over four years and fairly dramatic. But what needs to turn around is attitude. I found many people in this state who had given up, who felt <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> could not change, who felt that we were a slave to our past, who felt that the populist politicians owned <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. They're beginning to realize now that we are winners. Not me, we. This state's a winner.

 When the brothers appeared in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> movies in the'40s, choreographer <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Castle </PERSON> thought up `` mad tricks'' for the pair to do, <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Castle </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> wrote and directed `` Tap.'' Most of the tappers had to take other jobs during the lean years, said <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Tang </PERSON>, 73, who choreographed `` Tap'' and most of `` Black and Blue.'' <PERSON> Honi </PERSON> <PERSON> Coles </PERSON> weathered those years working at the Apollo Theater. <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> spent the'50s working in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Tang </PERSON>, who always loved to teach, opened a tap school when he was 20. `` Tap was my love,'' <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Tang </PERSON> said. When its popularity waned, he choreographed nightclub acts and, for seven years, TV's `` The <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> Show.'' Fifteen-year-old <PERSON> Savion </PERSON> <PERSON> Glover </PERSON>, a tap prodigy as were the <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brothers </PERSON>, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Rooney </PERSON>, absorbs every style of tap, <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Tang </PERSON> said. `` The older dancers call him ` the little sponge,''' hs said. `` As he keeps getting more spectacular, his own style will start to come out. It is beginning to happen and will continue to happen.'' All the older tappers seem to have nicknames. `` I have n't heard my real name in I do n't know when,'' <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Slyde </PERSON>, who's in both `` Tap'' and `` Black and Blue,'' specialized in sliding <PERSON> Bunny </PERSON> <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON>, 66, with his saucer eyes and Bambi-like lashes, dances in both `` Tap'' and `` Black and Blue.'' He got his nickname from his grandmother because when she'd come home from work, <PERSON> Bunny </PERSON> would quickly scoot to get her slippers. `` I danced as soon as I was born,'' he said. `` When I saw <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> dance, I knew I wanted to be a dancer. He sanctioned it.'' <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON> tapped with big bands as a visual addition and an added rhythm instrument. The earliest forms of tap dancing can be found centuries ago in parts of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. It was further distilled in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by African slaves and the immigrants who brought their clog dancing with them to the new world. Tap started its current escalation on <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION> in 1971, when `` No, No, <PERSON> Nanette </PERSON>'' was revived. `` Eubie!'' came to <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Eubie </PERSON> <PERSON> Blake </PERSON>, whose music it comprised wanted <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> and <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Hines </PERSON> in it, recalling them from the act they had with their father called <PERSON> Hines </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hines </PERSON> and Dad. The brothers went on to do `` <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellington </PERSON>'s Sophisticated Ladies.'' <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Riberio </PERSON> originated the title role in `` The Tap Dance Kid'' and the names of tappers such as <PERSON> Hinton </PERSON> Battle and <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> <PERSON> Burge </PERSON> got known around Broadway for that show and `` Sophisticated Ladies.'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reams </PERSON> brought Astaire-style tapping to `` 42nd Street.'' <PERSON> Honi </PERSON> <PERSON> Coles </PERSON> won a <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> as best supporting actor in a musical in `` My One and Only.'' <PERSON> Patti </PERSON> <PERSON> LuPone </PERSON> taps today in the revival of `` Anything Goes.'' Upcoming are Broadway musicals in which <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tune </PERSON> works with the <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rhythm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kings </ORGANIZATION> and one in which <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Hines </PERSON> plays, choreographs and dances as pianist-composer <PERSON> Jelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Roll </PERSON> <PERSON> Morton </PERSON>, allowing tap to signify music. <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Tang </PERSON> is confident that tap will resume its proper position in the arts. In the meantime, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tap </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> is underway in <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, giving the dance form an even greater credibility.

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> walked away from middle-class <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in 1969, leaving behind a job as a Madison Avenue headhunter and a wife and two sons to subsist on welfare and food stamps.

 <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> remembers cruising up the Bowery in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> as a boy, car windows tightly closed per his father's instructions `` to keep out the bums. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> abandoned the family when his son was 9. Hurt and angry, <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> vowed never to do to his kids what his father had done to him. A year or so later, his teacher asked him in front of his Flatbush classmates why his toes poked out the ends of his shoes. At that moment, <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> divined his future: `` I vowed to be another <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. I decided then and there I would push real hard not to have holes in my shoes ever again.'' <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s most influential champion of the homeless has a past rife with cosmic irony. Sixteen years after his father walked out, <ORGANIZATION> Snyder </ORGANIZATION> quit a lucrative job as a Madison Avenue headhunter and left his own wife and two sons to subsist on welfare and food stamps. Twenty years later, he has just the one pair of boots. Like the jeans he wears and the food he eats when he's not on one of his well-publicized hunger strikes, the tan boots are donations. So too are the cars he occasionally drives through neighborhoods most people avoid. The men and women he finds there, sleeping on heating grates and harvesting meals out of trash cans, often greet him by name. <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> never did learn to roll up his windows. For the past 15 years, he has dedicated himself to `` liberating people who are destitute.'' To that end, no one has garnered more newsprint, forced more hands, or coaxed more cash. But anyone tempted to pin any medals on him should take heed: <ORGANIZATION> Snyder </ORGANIZATION> is a reluctant hero. `` I was called by some force outside myself,'' says <ORGANIZATION> Snyder </ORGANIZATION>, who has since been forgiven by his family. `` I'm convinced that if I had a choice, I would n't be doing this.'' It's hard to argue. All told, he has spent two of his 45 years fasting, and another year sleeping on sidewalks. Now, he is embued with new optimism. After 15 years of chipping away at the national indifference to the homeless, <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> and others at the forefront of the struggle may finally be gaining ground. Recent polls indicate a greater desire to help others. A new president has arrived. A new decade is coming. `` I honestly believe <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is a nicer person,'' says <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON>. `` I believe <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was nice personally, but his politics were mean - spirited He was an almost impossible adversary. Not only was he made of Teflon, but he was made of magic and charisma. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> does n't have that magic, and he has less power to oppose changes.'' <ORGANIZATION> Snyder </ORGANIZATION>'s convinced things are changing. `` Listen to the music of <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, of U2. They are harbingers of a shift in mood. There's a 30-year cycle: the'30s, the'60s, the'90s. We've just come through the ` Me Decade.' I think people have gotten sick of living only for themselves.'' These days, <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> makes his home in the 1,400-bed shelter on Second Street, once a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> building that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration agreed to renovate only after <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> embarked on a 51-day hunger strike that melted away 60 pounds in 1984. The shelter also is home to other members of the <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Creative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Non-Violence </ORGANIZATION>, a former anti-war group turned advocates for the homeless. There is no payroll; everyone volunteers. Commitment runs high, but this is hardly utopia. Next to sharing living space with one's compatriots, <ORGANIZATION> Snyder </ORGANIZATION> says, starvation is easy. But like most CCNV acts _ erecting `` Reaganville,'' a tent city across from the <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION>, or releasing a hundred cockroaches in the state dining room _ its communal lifestyle is fraught with symbolism. `` Individualism is pathological,'' <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> says. `` Our separateness is what's killing us. Ignorance and fear are products of distance. That's what enables us to spend a trillion dollars a year on arms while people sleep in the street. `` The issue is how to reduce that distance. Once humanity is seen and felt, the ability to do damage is reduced.'' The nation's apathy toward the homeless stems largely from fear, <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> thinks. `` They're a reflection of us. We're all vulnerable. We have to keep the messenger at bay.'' That is n't to say Americans are uncharitable, he says, but given a choice, most people are more apt to help victims of earthquakes in other countries than victims of federal housing policies in their own. Natural disasters, <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> says, `` do not call into question our values and our lifestyle. Homelessness does. The obvious answer, especially in cities teeming with street people, is to render the homeless invisible.

 `` Two urges are at odds. The urge to create a democracy _ the urge that made people live in communities and rebuild barns _ and economics, the urge toward competition and individualism and greed. One implies charity and generosity. The other says to hell with the community, create your own niche. `` The negative side has become dominant. But the other side nags at us. We're such a sophisticated, fast-paced society, just getting through the day is task enough. We have become a frightened, neurotic people. We drug ourselves to make reality a little softer. Our families are falling apart. Our schools are breaking down. `` We have createdrld.'' <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> walked away from middle-class <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in 1969, after waking up one night `` literally in a cold sweat.'' A high school dropo an unnatural wout who sold washing machines before talking his way into a high-paying job as an executive recruiter, <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> got married and had two children before he realized he was n't cut out to be a family man. He set out to find himself and wound up in federal prison on an auto-theft charge. While serving time at <LOCATION> Danbury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, he got to know <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Berrigan </PERSON>, in prison for destroying draft records. <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> joined the two priests' anti-war group, made up of prisoneviolent protest, and read a book a day for 2 -LCB- years. After his release in 1972, <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> joined an anti-war group in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, then moved to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> a year later to join CCNV. In time, he says, `` Homelessness became the domestic counterpart to what was happening in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. In 1975, the war had ended. In the house I was living in, we were dealing with evictions of families. We opened up our living room to people.'' Over the years, the seam between <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON>'s life and his work has disappeared. `` The deeper you go in, the more you understand the symbols,'' he says. Identifying and exploiting those symbols _ tearing down fences, both literally and figuratively _ is the key to <ORGANIZATION> CCNV </ORGANIZATION>'s agenda of civil disobedience. `` Our acts are very Old Testament,'' he says. `` We're dealing with symbols and images. Fasting reminds people that real lives are at stake. Symbols like fences are very emotionally charged. Property that exists only to hurt others has no right to exist.'' <ORGANIZATION> Snyder </ORGANIZATION>'s adversaries have found the hunger strikes particularly antagonizing, such as his 1978 fast in an attempt to force a wealthy <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> church in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to contribute to the CCNV shelter fund. `` It was like having a gun pointed at my head,'' recalls the Rev. James English. English refused, and eventually, close to death, <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> abandoned the fast. `` I do n't do these things to get people upset, but I have no qualms about upsetting people,'' <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> says. `` When people begin to feel, they begin to think.'' Within the homeless movement, where nothing remotely approaching consensus has emerged, <ORGANIZATION> Snyder </ORGANIZATION> is not without critics. Detractors have portrayed him as self-serving and publicity-hungry. Some call him `` Hollywood <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON>.'' The $ 5 million it took to renovate the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> shelter upset some advocates, including <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Sprowal </PERSON>, a former hospital workers union organizer. `` How many houses could you build for that kind of money? How many people could you put to work with that kind of money?'' <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> acknowledges that overnight shelter is a temporary answer. `` The long-term is adequate housing. The real solution is a society that's not built on never-ending consumption. But no more shelters is a barbaric thought.'' The Hollywood reference sprung from a made-for-TV movie that glossed over <ORGANIZATION> Snyder </ORGANIZATION>'s abandonment of his family and zeroed in on his good deeds. That <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheen </PERSON>, who played <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON>, called him `` a saint'' did n't help. <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> steadfastly refuses to watch the film and squirms when asked about it. A soft-spoken man who professes to be uncomfortable in the spotlight, he also has a talent for making the most of it. The movie, `` Samaritan: The <ORGANIZATION> Mitch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Snyder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Story </ORGANIZATION>,'' added $ 150,000 to the movement's war chest. Besides, <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> discovered <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> long ago. It was only a matter of time before <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> discovered him. `` The three biggest influences on my life were all movies: ` Mr. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> Goes to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,' ` It's a Wonderful Life,' and ` A Christmas <PERSON> Carol </PERSON>.' `` They taught me the lessons of my life: that good will always overcome evil, and that the most insignificant person can make a difference, provided what he's doing is right.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ An <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> research center has made significant contributions to the treatment of disease over the years. But those breakthroughs have come though experimentation with monkeys and apes, and that has incensed animal rights activists who frequently stage protest demonstrations at the center. The director of the center has received death threats and other staff members say they fear for their personal safety.

 Tucked into a wooded corner of <ORGANIZATION> Emory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s suburban campus, the <ORGANIZATION> Yerkes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Primate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> has long exuded an air of mystery Security fences and `` Private Property'' signs greet those who find their way down a winding two-lane road behind <ORGANIZATION> Emory </ORGANIZATION> dorms and offices, through the woods, past a secluded lake. Here for years white-coated scientists have labored quietly to find, through study and experimentation with monkeys and apes, answers to health problems that plague humans. But now there's an us-against-them feeling at <LOCATION> Yerkes </LOCATION>. The researchers' pride in their accomplishments is tempered by frustration, anger and even fear. A growing band of crusaders would like nothing more than to shut the center down. `` I was n't hired to do this, you know,'' grumbles Dr. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> A </PERSON>. <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, having to explain to yet another reporter the steps <ORGANIZATION> Yerkes </ORGANIZATION> takes to conduct its research as humanely as possible. King, an outspoken advocate of animal research and the director of <ORGANIZATION> Yerkes </ORGANIZATION> for a decade, has been the target of death threats. His center, an arm of <ORGANIZATION> Emory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and one of seven regional primate research centers sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, has been the site of numerous protests by animal rights activists. Last December, 12 people were arrested on the <LOCATION> Emory </LOCATION> campus in a demonstration against the use of animals in scientific research, the second such protest in a month. Three of those arrested lowered themselves on ropes down the front of a six-story building and unfurled a huge banner reading `` Save the Yerkes Chimps.'' The other nine tried to block the university's main gate. Members of the California-based group In <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Animals </ORGANIZATION> said the protest marked the beginning of a two-year campaign against centers like <ORGANIZATION> Yerkes </ORGANIZATION>. Elsewhere in the nation, buildings have been burned and animal rights activists have been arrested with bombs. <ORGANIZATION> Yerkes </ORGANIZATION> staffers say they sometimes wonder about their personal safety. King says he has `` good reason to believe'' that virtually every institution like his has been infiltrated by animal-rights activists. But his chief worry, <PERSON> King </PERSON> says, is that the animal rights movement could diminish the effectiveness of the center, a place where new techniques for treating Parkinson's disease were found, where ape communication studies led to new ways of teaching retarded children. `` What I am afraid of,'' he says, `` is that these people may get bills passed in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, regulations passed through federal agencies, that could be terribly, terribly injurious to research, terribly restrictive and costly beyond belief. `` That's my fear, that they will whittle us down _ not that they will knock us out of the box. By their acts of violence and terrorism, breaking, entering, bomb threats, destroying property, stealing animals, falsifying photographs of this and that, they cost us a hell of a lot of money.'' The center, named for its founder, Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yerkes </PERSON>, a primate research pioneer, has three locations: the main station, with labs and offices; a southeast <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> language lab, and the field station, a spartan 117 acres in suburban <LOCATION> Gwinnett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> where 1,500 primates _ from 1,000 rhesus monkeys to a small family of pygmy chimpanzees _ live in two dozen separately housed groups. Add to that 13 gorillas and a dozen orangutans at <LOCATION> Zoo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> under an unusual and popular arrangement. The Zoo Atlanta project, in which primates roam in open-air approximations of their original habitats, has spurred an ambitious renovation plan that has brought the once-beleaguered zoo new-found respect and thousands of new visitors. It's also good public relations for <ORGANIZATION> Yerkes </ORGANIZATION>, as it presents the center's name to happy zoo visitors gazing at cuddly looking creatures. It's also an ongoing research effort. Yerkes scientists continue to study the behavior and reproduction of the gorillas and orangutans at the zoo. In particular, <ORGANIZATION> Yerkes </ORGANIZATION> staffers and Atlantans in general hope that Zoo <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> mainstay, <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON>, a gorilla who spent nearly three decades in a cage, will settle down with a <ORGANIZATION> Yerkes </ORGANIZATION> female in his new outdoor playground and have little Willies. But most of the Yerkes animals are at the field station, a large site once out in the country, but now rapidly being surrounded by subdivisions. It is there, amid heated concrete shelters and fenced-in pens, that some 30 research scientists and animal care technicians work with sooty mangabeys, squirrel monkeys, chimps, and that staple of research labs, rhesus monkeys. On a recent winter's day, field station coordinator and research professor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, strolled up to a gymnasium-size pen housing hundreds of rhesus monkeys and started calling them by name. `` You get to know them after a while,'' he says. Yerkes scientists continually observe the monkeys, looking for new behavioral characteristics. Even in the largest colonies, one monkey is king, and a social hierarchy flows downward from him, his mate and her offspring, with other families acting subservient. While some of the rhesus colony are taken from time to time for lab experiments at the main station, others live on at the field station for generations in an ongoing behavioral study. Another primate group getting a great deal of attention at the field station these days is a collection of sooty mangabeys who, as it turns out, are almost universally infected with SIV _ simian immunodeficiency virus, a close cousin of HIV, or human immunodeficiency virus, the killer virus that causes AIDS. Most primates infected with SIV will become ill, as do humans infected with HIV. But for some reason, the sooty mangabeys, for the most part, never become clinically ill.

 `` We hope that if we can figure out what the devil provides that protection, we can contract a vaccine that provides protection,'' <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> says. Around the corner from the mangabeys is a family of pygmy chimpanzees, part of an ambitious breeding program. The animals sometimes do n't breed easily in captivity, and <ORGANIZATION> Yerkes </ORGANIZATION> researchers are proud of their eight pygmy births. Across the grounds is a group of full-size chimpanzees, being watched in a food-and-behavior study and also part of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>'s five-institution <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chimpanzee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Breeding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION>. Researchers figure the animals, so closely related to man, may be needed someday for AIDS research. In the laboratories at the main <ORGANIZATION> Yerkes </ORGANIZATION> station in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, scientists are studying various primates in efforts to combat Parkinson's disease, eye disorders and even tooth decay. The Parkinson's research, King says, is one of the center's crowning achievements since he arrived as director in 1978 Yerkes scientists were the first to demonstrate the feasibility of implanting fetal brain tissue that produces dopamine _ a compound which acts as a transmitter in the nervous system _ into the brain of <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON>'s patients as a treatment for the debilitating nerve disease. Now, doctors in several countries are trying the same technique in humans. `` I consider this one of our major advancements,'' King says. `` We were the first. It's a big step in the right direction.'' Other achievements at <LOCATION> Yerkes </LOCATION> in the past 10 years: _ An anti-inflammatory drug, effective in rhesus monkeys in stopping the progression of periodontal disease, is now being tested in human patients at <ORGANIZATION> Emory </ORGANIZATION>'s dental school _ <ORGANIZATION> Yerkes </ORGANIZATION> scientists and <ORGANIZATION> Emory </ORGANIZATION> ophthalmologists, using primates, are studying methods of post-surgery treatment for children born with cataracts Their work has shown that a traditional technique of patching the normal eye, forcing the child to use the operated-upon eye, may be detrimental. _ Researchers using monkeys, chimps and human volunteers have found structural and chemical changes in cervical secretions during the menstrual cycle, which could someday lead to new methods of birth control or promoting fertility _ Language studies in chimpanzees yielded a language system _ with visual symbols, a computer-operated keyboard and step-by-step teaching strategies _ that is now being used by cooperating <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> experts to teach severely retarded children to communicate The work was spearheaded by two psychologists from <LOCATION> Yerkes </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, Dr. <PERSON> Duane </PERSON> <PERSON> Rumbaugh </PERSON> and his wife, Dr. <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage-Rumbaugh </PERSON>. `` The work of the Rumbaughs must stand very high in the achievements of this center,'' King says. King, a neuroscientist and psychologist, enjoys explaining that the Rumbaughs were not, at first, looking for a way to help retarded kids; they were looking at apes. `` That began as an attempt to explore some fundamental questions about the use and capability of great apes to use symbols,'' he says. `` The important thing is that it started out as a fundamental scientific project, with nothing in sight in terms of application.'' He compares the accomplishment to <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>'s accidental discovery of penicillin's properties during routine mold studies. `` It is that kind of science that has brought us out of medieval fear and superstition into enlightenment and our ability to deal more effectively with the world around us,'' King saysd. King acknowledges that animals die at <LOCATION> Yerkes </LOCATION>, but he maintains they die in the pursuit of what researchers believe is a greater good. Most people, <PERSON> King </PERSON> says, believe that way, too. `` I believe in the sanity of the people of this country,'' he says. `` This is a utilitarian nation. That utilitarian sense, and the recognition of what animal contributions have been _ and the recognition that scientists are not ogres, but care for living beings other than humans _ I think will lead the nation to recognize eventually the benefits of science. `` This nation will support, and continue to support, life sciences in general and medical and behavioral sciences in specific, with primates or whatever other species. I have that confidence.'' King bristles when asked whether, in retrospect, some experiments have proven to be unnecessary killing of animals. `` Do we have experiments that fail? Of course we do,'' he says. `` It's part of science. `` If we knew what was going to happen for sure, we would n't do the experiment! Nobody wants to do stupid, meaningless work.'' King's stresses in his lectures that animal researchers are not extremists. The extremists, he insists, are those who would needlessly butcher and torture animals _ or those who would ban any scientific use of animals at all. `` In all sincerity,'' he says, `` scientists occupy the middle road of compassion and humane treatment ... I do n't know any scientist or institution that does n't want to reduce that discomfort or pain to a minimum, but at the same time recognizes that human priorities, with regard to using animals in research, must come first.'' King envisions a day when he and <ORGANIZATION> Yerkes </ORGANIZATION> can put the debate behind them and get on with their work, and his goals go beyond behavioral and medical research. Without prodding, a discussion of <LOCATION> Yerkes </LOCATION> quickly turns to King's two passions: the endangered <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> rain forests _ `` without those, neither the primates nor other species will survive long'' _ and global population control, as man's increasing presence taxes his planet's resources `` I would like to see us move into the area of population concerns,'' he says, conceding that for a traditional primate research center, such work poses `` a difficult question.'' `` ` Primate center' does n't just mean monkeys and apes,'' he said. `` It means humans, too.''

Being about 10, he did n't exactly know procedure so he tried three different versions to spread-eagle possibilities Think that stopped any presses? Nope.

Not obit material in spite of what it may tell us about the sins of the father or even dead cousins. In life we are surrounded by `` what ifs'' and other narrow escapes. Not in death. I had an uncle whose father promised to take him to the new nickelodeon for his 10th birthday. The morning of the great event he had sniffles. His mother, a no-nonsense ex-schoolteacher, would n't let him out of the house. That's why he was n't sitting in a reserved front row seat when the Iroquois Theater burned down in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> in 1903 killing 602 people. His escape never made the prints until now. So how come obits never say what made us cry at the funeral and laugh at the wake? Alumni magazines are particularly remiss. Most of'em just say `` deceased.'' But part of the news is how our old pals departed this realm and what they'd done since we last saw them pouring milk punch over their heads at senior houseparties. Did they make a hole-in-one? Win a lottery? Scale K2? Did they die in a bar fight in the Klondike? Lose a duel to a jealous husband? Did their parachutes fail to open? Do n't ask the obit. There's a tradition at <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> for freshmen to try and climb up the ivy at <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION> and steal the clapper from the bell so everyone will have an excuse for not getting to 8 o'clock class on time. Well, I know a guy who not only got the clapper, he also found out where they hid all the spare clappers and pinched them, too. Obit matter? You kidding? Last words get dropped from our lives as well. When <PERSON> Henrik </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibsen </PERSON>, the Norwegian playwright, lay dying, his night nurse told the day nurse the patient seemed to be slightly better. `` Tvertimod,'' gasped the failing <PERSON> Ibsen </PERSON>. In English that says, `` On the contrary.'' Obits never give us a chance to say, `` So long.'' To clinch my case I give you <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Bainton </PERSON> and the cow business. Who? <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bainton </PERSON>. Friend. Dead the other day, age 63. `` At his death Mr. <PERSON> Bainton </PERSON> was ...'' That's what the obit said in two grafs of a large metropolitan daily. OK, that paper's obit page is harder to get into than heaven, so they may be forgiven for not getting the rest of the story. But there's no sense waiting around for <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> to come up with it. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bainton </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>. If <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> were an Oriental bazaar, Mr. <PERSON> Bainton </PERSON> would have ended up selling flying carpets that turned into 747s. Maybe your sister married the type. A visionary. Early on. Right after World War II there was a restriction on exporting non-essential vehicles to a war-impoverished world. So Mr. <PERSON> Bainton </PERSON> whitewashed some station wagons, painted red crosses on them and shipped them to <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> as ambulances _ until one day there was a cloudburst in <LOCATION> Recife </LOCATION> He assured authorities he would never do it again, and did n't. But they never found out about the ambulances that had gone to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> where it never rains. After selling the idea of centrifuging to the Peruvians to help make them one of the world's leading fish-meal producers, Mr. <PERSON> Bainton </PERSON> settled in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> helping advise one of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s richest men what to do with 3,000 acres he owned, since you can build just so many resorts and golf courses Build a dairy, said Mr. <PERSON> Bainton </PERSON>, while everyone else laughed because the land was coral and prickly bushes. Based on his own research, plus a hunch that defied conventional geology, he claimed there would be soil underneath the coral. He was right. So what to do with the coral? Build a rock-crushing plant to extract the lime to build the cinder-block houses Bahamians live in. Then find cows that prosper in the semitropics, plant crops and start milking. The Bahamas at the time imported 95 percent of its milk from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, so by the time it arrived in the islands, it was already a day toward sour. Mr. <PERSON> Bainton </PERSON>'s dairy eventually was producing almost as much milk as the Bahamians could drink. He later had a business that made bricks out of garbage, pioneered in embryo implants to improve cattle breeds and proposed making a massive banana plantation in <LOCATION> Oyster </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, under the world's largest greenhouse, heated by a refuse incinerator. He never got around to building the power plant he figured would have lit up all Nassau by producing electricity from the up-welling thermal currents in the ocean. `` Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,'' wrote the poet <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> after ruminating in a country graveyard. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> really sounds like he just finished reading an obit page.

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ Chicagoans go to the polls this week in a special mayoral election to decide who will serve the last two years of the second term of the late <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>, the city's first black mayor. The leading candidates are two blacks hoping to win over <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s supporters and the son of the longtime political boss <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>.

 The ghosts of two former mayors are hovering over the campaign trail as voters in the nation's third-largest city decide who will lead them into the 1990s. Long gone is the late Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, a boss of the old school, who used concentrated political muscle to run <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> for 21 years before his death in 1976. But the front-runner in the special Democratic mayoral primary is one of his sons, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, the 46-year-old <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> state's attorney whose blood ties to City Hall legend sometimes seem to transcend his own record. Gone as well is <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>, the city's first black mayor, whose death on Nov. 25, 1987, set the stage for this year's special election. But his legacy of leadership is a key issue for black voters being wooed by Mayor <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, 54, <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>'s chief primary rival, and <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, 45, who is running a third-party campaign on the `` Harold <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'' ticket. At stake in the special mayoral contest are the last two years of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s second term. In the Democratic primary, <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> also face <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON>, a white alderman who supported <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, and two lagging candidates. Three Republicans _ none well known in this Democratic stronghold _ were on the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> ballot. After the Feb. 28 primary elections, <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> will take on the winners in the April 4 general election. This campaign season, in a city known for its deep racial divisions, black voters who united behind <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> are being ardently courted by <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>. Neither can supplant the affable, streetwise <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, who has become a symbol of change and unity for many Chicagoans. `` <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> ... embodied all of the hopes and aspirations of a generation of people who genuinely believed that <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> was ready for reform,'' said Cook County Recorder of Deeds <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Moseley </PERSON> <PERSON> Braun </PERSON>, who last fall became the first black to win a major county office. Five weeks before the primary, <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> _ elected by the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to succeed <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> _ finally won the endorsement of civil rights leader and presidential contender <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` He has done more than any of his primary opponents to sustain the <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> coalition,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. But the delay in that long-awaited endorsement underscores the discord in the black community since <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s death. And <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> declined to say where he would stand if <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> faced <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> in the general election. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, who served as <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s floor leader in the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, is campaigning as the late mayor's heir apparent. His withdrawal from the Democratic primary prevented a split in the black vote that would have virtually guaranteed <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> the nomination. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s endorsement was a matter of great concern to both black candidates, but some observers say it wo n't help <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>. A massive black turnout is <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>'s only chance in the primary, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleppner </PERSON>, author of `` <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Divided: The Making of a Black Mayor'' and director of the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in De <PERSON> Kalb </PERSON>. `` My suspicion is that he -LRB- <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> -RRB- is going to get the overwhelming bulk of the black vote, with moderate turnout _ and that wo n't be enough,'' he said. <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> still has `` the image that he was put in there by the white aldermen,'' <PERSON> Kleppner </PERSON> said, referring to the role of longtime <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> foes in engineering <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>'s election over <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> as acting mayor in December 1987. `` Time heals a lot of wounds,'' counters <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s former political office director, who endorsed <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> and predicts a strong black turnout for him. The racial breakdown of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s voting-age population on July 1 was about 46.8 percent white, 38.3 percent black and 14.9 percent Hispanic, said <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bousfield </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s city demographer.

 In 1983, black voters turned out in force to support <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in the primary, giving him 36 percent of the vote and a stunning victory over then-Mayor <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> yrne and <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, who divided the white vote. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> went on to a narrow victory in a racially charged general-election fight against little-known Republican <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Epton </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kleppner </PERSON> said he believes the racism that marked the 1983 mayoral contest remains, but `` it's under the rug.'' Racism was tempered when the city actually had a black mayor, he said, and many white voters feel <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> is a shoo-in. <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>'s status as front-runner has not been hurt by virtually citywide recognition of the family name. `` Bring back the <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> dynasty!'' supporters cheer at some campaign stops. <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> _ and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> _ came up through the ranks of the `` machine,'' the patronage-rich political organization <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>'s father built <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> says little about his father, whose last years in office were marred by the riots at the 1968 Democratic National Convention and other controversies. He cites his own record as county prosecutor and a state senator. `` The politics and name-calling are tearing <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> apart when we need to work together,'' <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> told a civic club meeting. `` I'm not interested in being ` the white candidate,' or in serving as mayor for half the people.'' <PERSON> Kleppner </PERSON> says <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> will win the primary if he avoids the kind of slip that could provide a focal point for black opposition. He adds that such a slip is unlikely since <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> `` has been very well scripted.'' <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> kept to that script in a television debate earlier this month with <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON>. Repeatedly baited by <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> _ who at one point said his supporters thought <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> was the `` great white hope'' _ <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> refused to spar. City jobs and minority hiring are hot topics and <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, boasting that a quarter of city contracts are going to minorities, contends <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>'s election would mean moving backward. Aides say <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> has a good affirmative action record in his office, more than doubling the number of black lawyers there in eight years. Activist <PERSON> Lu </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> said he's not convinced. `` No white mayor has ever been sensitive to the needs of our people,'' he said. <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> may benefit from black-Jewish tension lingering after the furor last spring over tape-recorded lectures by <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cokely </PERSON> that contained anti-Semitic remarks. <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> waited five days to fire Cokely. A few hours before the announcement, <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> denounced <PERSON> Cokely </PERSON>'s remarks as `` inappropriate.'' There are many Jews among the white `` lakefront liberals'' who helped elect <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` I do n't think that either black mayoral candidate played an exemplary role in the Cokely affair,'' said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> of the local Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith. There have been other tussles. Days after becoming mayor, <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> faced the disclosure that as an alderman years before, he accepted what he called a finder's fee of $ 30,000 for helping a lawyer obtain a bank loan. In another case, he admitted filing income tax returns late, though no money was owed the government. <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, meanwhile, was questioned about a report that petitions circulated for a failed 1986 referendum to make the mayor's race non-partisan may have included fraudulent signatures linked to workers in his office. He cooled the issue by calling for appointment of a special prosecutor. <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> says the winner of the Democratic primary is sure to be mayor, but <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> demonstrated considerable strength when he submitted more than 100,000 signatures in filing for his third-party bid _ four times the required number. <PERSON> Kleppner </PERSON> suggests it does n't much matter who wins. With the 1991 regularly scheduled mayoral race coming up soon after this spring's special election, the winner will begin campaigning immediately, he said. `` What this city needs it's not going to get from any of the candidates,'' <PERSON> Kleppner </PERSON> said, `` and that's long-range planning.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ At age 81, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Romney </PERSON> is a man of remarkable achievement in both government and business. But he's not done yet.

 The dean of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s Republicans skipped the inaugural ceremony, but his influence was felt as the presidential mantle was passed from <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Romney </PERSON>, the former governor, former <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> member and one-time auto executive who made an abortive run for the White House himself two decades ago, decided he did n't want to fight the crowds. `` I've been going to inaugurals since <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Delano </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> was inaugurated. I've been to so many,'' the 81-year-old <PERSON> Romney </PERSON> was saying the other day as he relaxed at his home, looking fit and trim despite his snow-white hair. <PERSON> Romney </PERSON> worked with the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> transition team to help initiate <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s `` Thousand Points of Light'' program and to shape three volunteer programs which <PERSON> Romney </PERSON> wants to see headed by <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Loret </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruppe </PERSON>. At <PERSON> Romney </PERSON>'s urging, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced the three programs during the campaign. <PERSON> Romney </PERSON> puts encouraging volunteer work at the top of his list of accomplishments. `` As a result of my experiences, I've concluded that the most important thing I can do is to strengthen the whole volunteer aspect of American life,'' he says. More important than reviving the fortunes of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in the 1960s? More important that spearheading a citizens' effort to streamline the state constitution in 1961? More important than becoming the first Republican to capture the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> governor's chair in 14 years? Yes, because to <PERSON> Romney </PERSON> government no longer is the solution to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s problems. `` The most powerful problem-solving force on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> is the organized, voluntary cooperation of a free people,'' he says. Since 1974, <PERSON> Romney </PERSON> has been founding chairman of Volunteer _ the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, an organization based in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, that is dedicated to encouraging volunteerism. His goal is to create a Volunteer Center in every community that has a <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Way </LOCATION>. The centers recruit and place volunteers in local organizations. `` I concluded some years ago we had barely tapped the problem-solving potential of people helping people, as volunteers,'' says <PERSON> Romney </PERSON>, who created the nation's first <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Way </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> in 1948. `` I concluded we had organized the money part of volunteering better than we had organized the people part.'' Nearly every week finds <PERSON> Romney </PERSON> on the road somewhere, trying to add to the 350 Volunteer Centers already established. On this winter's day, <PERSON> Romney </PERSON> had just returned from an eight-mile walk, a regimen he follows even on <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s coldest days. In the summer, he adds a round of golf at nearby <ORGANIZATION> Bloomfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hills </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Country </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> to his exercise routine. `` I do n't even have arthritis in my little finger,'' he says. `` I've been fortunate, knock on wood.'' His modern, secluded home is on the edge of a private pond that is stocked with goldfish and fringed with pine trees. In his study, he is surrounded by a wall of books, a signed photograph of former President <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, and Time magazine covers bearing his own picture. <PERSON> Romney </PERSON> was born July 8, 1907, in <LOCATION> Chihuahua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, where his parents and other Mormons had moved to avoid <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> laws restricting the practice of polygamy. He grew up in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, where he met his future wife, <PERSON> Lenore </PERSON>, while in high school. He was 17 and she was 15. They were married seven years later. Their 57-year marriage has produced four children, 22 grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.

 <PERSON> Romney </PERSON> attended four colleges, but never graduated. He spent two years as a Mormon missionary in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, giving speeches in <LOCATION> Trafalgar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hyde </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Romney </PERSON>'s first exposure to politics was in 1929 as an aide to Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. After that were stints at <ORGANIZATION> ALCOA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Aluminum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wares </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. His first job in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> came in 1939, when he was local manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Automobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. He later became general manager, but left in 1948 to join <ORGANIZATION> AMC </ORGANIZATION>, where he eventually became chairman. At <ORGANIZATION> AMC </ORGANIZATION>, he oversaw the marketing of the first successful compact economy car on the American market _ the Rambler. `` We forced the Big Three into small car production,'' he says. The company's stock went from $ 5 a share to $ 90 a share with him at the helm. <ORGANIZATION> AMC </ORGANIZATION> was purchased by <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in August 1987. `` <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> has had to close down plants I used to make successful,'' <PERSON> Romney </PERSON> says. <PERSON> Romney </PERSON> used to rent <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stadium </ORGANIZATION> to gather <ORGANIZATION> AMC </ORGANIZATION> employees and their families for a meeting. `` We'd talk to them about what we were confronted with,'' <PERSON> Romney </PERSON> recalls, adding that modern corporations and labor unions are guilty of thinking only of wages and profits. <PERSON> Romney </PERSON>'s first public service came in 1957, when he headed a panel to study problems in the Detroit schools. In 1959, he created Citizens for <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, a bipartisan group that later spearheaded the drive for a constitutional convention to rewrite the state's constitution because of a deadlock between the governor and <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Romney </PERSON>'s first candidacy was in 1961, when he ran successfully as a delegate to the constitutional convention. `` We were the first state since World War I to rewrite a whole constitution and have it adopted by a vote of the people,'' he says. A year later, he was elected as <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s first Republican governor since 1948. <PERSON> Romney </PERSON>'s political stock rose rapidly after he won his third term in 1966. He began to eye a run at the presidency. On a September 1967 television interview show, <PERSON> Romney </PERSON> startled the nation by saying he had originally supported the war in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> because he had been brainwashed by the military during a tour of the Southeast Asian country. Five months later, shortly before the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary, <PERSON> Romney </PERSON> withdrew from the race. `` It was n't because of my position on <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> or anything I said about <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>,'' he says. `` It was because <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON> became a candidate and there was no way I could get the nomination fighting both <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> later picked <PERSON> Romney </PERSON> to be secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, a post he held from 1969 to 1972, when he resigned to return to the private sector. He returned to politics during the last presidential campaign when it appeared strife between the forces of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> would rip the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> GOP party apart. `` He was quick to stand up and remind people, publicly and privately, that there was a bigger fight ahead of us in the fall,'' says <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON>. <PERSON> Romney </PERSON> found the campaign disappointing, with the candidates afraid to discuss issues for fear of losing votes. `` We no longer have a republic,'' he says. `` We have a special interest pork-barrel democracy and we have n't adjusted our institutions to that fact.''

 There may be some Scots who ca n't bear the bagpipe, but it's a rare Russian who bad-mouths the balalaika. `` The balalaika is the instrument most close to the Russian soul,'' says <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukin </PERSON>, one of the 82 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Osipov </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Balalaika </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION>, which is on a tour of 40 American cities through March 9. `` It is very tender, very touching. It starts singing in the hands of a real master.'' What's a balalaika? Well, it's a stringed instrument somewhat like a guiter, but is triangular shaped, usually has only three strings, and comes in a variety of sizes. Americans may remember the sound from `` <PERSON> Lara </PERSON>'s Theme,'' on the sound track of the film `` Dr. Zhivago.'' <PERSON> Lukin </PERSON> plays the domra, which looks like a round-bodied banjo, its flat front the size of a dinner plate. Many balalaikas sound best, apparently, mixed with complimentary instruments such as the domra. <PERSON> Lukin </PERSON> and other members of the <PERSON> Osipov </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s top balalaika orchestra, were interviewed through an interpreter. `` We're doing all kinds of songs _ sad and merry. They all depict the state of a soul,'' says <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalinin </PERSON>, the orchestra's conductor and artistic director `` There are really rhythmic, energetic songs. You want to dance when you hear them,'' adds singer <PERSON> Nadja </PERSON> <PERSON> Babkina </PERSON>, founder of the <ORGANIZATION> Babkina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Folk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ensemble </ORGANIZATION>, which is on tour with the orchestra. Miss <PERSON> Babkina </PERSON>, who wears her long hair dramatically forward over one shoulder, says that in the 16th century, balalaika players were dispersed and their instruments were burned because they were thought to be diverting people's attention from the church. `` That's why a law was signed by our czar that all these groups of amateur artists should be destroyed and the instruments also,'' she says. `` Russian people tried to hide these instruments. In the 18th century someone said it was time to renew them.'' `` Why do n't you ask how to play it?'' asks <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, 41, holding his wooden balalaika that was made in 1910 by a man named <PERSON> Nalimov </PERSON>, the Stradivarius of balalaika makers. Then he demonstrates, drawing his right index finger across the strings like a violin bow. `` It is such a strong finger, he can even open a bottle,'' says <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Butushin </PERSON>, who plays an array of horns that he has made, some with bells made of cows' horns. `` I go to a place where they kill cows and take quickly their horns,'' Butushin says. `` We have several such places in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>.'' The balalaika, used mainly for playing folk music, is more popular in rural areas, but it is not unknown in the cities. <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Byeloblotsky </PERSON>, 38, playing some jazz riffs on his bass balalaika, says he was born in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and heard the balalaika as a child. `` I started playing contrabass, like in the symphony orchestra,'' he says. `` Then I was very fond of jazz and I played in a jazz orchestra which went away from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and now is in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Now I'm playing this bass balalaika and I'm really very happy. I think that is the thing I wanted to do.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who plays `` prima balalaika,'' the main one of the five sizes of balalaikas in the <PERSON> Osipov </PERSON> orchestra, started on the accordion, like his father. `` I joined music school when I was 15 years old,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> says. `` I heard balalaika and I liked very much the sound and I started seriously studying this instrument. I was born in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> but my relatives came from villages.'' Conductor <PERSON> Kalinin </PERSON> explains that orchestra members and aspiring members alike must audition each year. Seniority does n't count. `` If somebody proves not so good, he retires,'' he says. Accordion player <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> Konovalov </PERSON> says, `` I was born in 1941, when the Germans were very close to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in the Second World War. My mother went to a village and I was born with an accordion in my hands. At that time, in villages, it was the most popular instrument. At night, people came out of their homes and sat on benches and started playing. `` I started playing the gormoyan, which is a purely Russian accordion, when I was 12.'' <PERSON> Kalinin </PERSON>, 45, the orchestra conductor for 10 years, was once a professional singer. His wife plays domra in the orchestra. The youngest of their three children, now 5, waved his hands like a conductor _ `` by a kind of inheritance,'' his father says _ before he could talk. Butushin, whose interest in horns crowded out his earlier balalaika playing, has been in the orchestra for 20 years, since he was 15, and has been on all its American tours _ in 1969,'71 and'77. <PERSON> Lukin </PERSON>, 31, started out playing the cello as a boy in music school. `` I was so small and the cello was so big and heavy, I thought it was better if I played this domra,'' he says. `` Since then I deeply love this instrument.'' `` This domra player is the best in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Kalinin </PERSON> says. `` He's concert master in the orchestra. He treats his domra like a beloved woman.'' <PERSON> Lukin </PERSON>'s wife also plays domra in the <PERSON> Osipov </PERSON> orchestra and in the American concerts they play a duet, which they encore with a <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Joplin </PERSON> rag. The <LOCATION> Osipov </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Balalaika </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orchestra </LOCATION> is the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s biggest and best, conductor <PERSON> Kalinin </PERSON> says. `` It was founded by <PERSON> Vassily </PERSON> <PERSON> Andreyev </PERSON> in 1919, consisting of eight players.'' <PERSON> Kalinin </PERSON> says. `` He dressed the balalaika in a tuxedo.'' Conductor <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrovich </PERSON> <PERSON> Osipov </PERSON> later added other instruments and commissioned composers. After his death in 1946, the orchestra was named for him. The sound caught on outside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kalinin </PERSON> adds. `` After <PERSON> Andreyev </PERSON> led a tour, balalaika orchestras were formed in countries all over the world.'' However, as far as <PERSON> Kalinin </PERSON> knows, all such ensembles now are in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Boxleitner </PERSON> has another series in the works, but in the lull between jobs he's back in the saddle with no cameras turning. `` I'm taking advantage of it to ride and hunt and play the rodeos,'' says <PERSON> Boxleitner </PERSON>, whose last series was `` Scarecrow and Mrs. King'' and whose next is a wild comedy adventure called `` The Road Raiders.'' In the meantime, <PERSON> Boxleitner </PERSON> stars with <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Diahann </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> in the two-part <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> miniseries `` From the Dead of Night,'' which will be televised Monday and Tuesday. During his time off he's going quail hunting in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and will enter the cutting horse and team roping contests at the <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> Pro-Celebrity Rodeo in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>. At the presidential inauguration in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Boxleitner </PERSON> was host of `` A Salute To the First Lady'' at the <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and was a guest for dinner at the home of Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> `` I was up on stage in front of the National Symphony and I had to introduce the conductor, <PERSON> Mstislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostropovich </PERSON>,'' he says. `` I had to keep saying his name over and over again so I'd get it right.'' <PERSON> Boxleitner </PERSON>, a Republican in an industry noted for its liberal activism, says he found <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to be an exciting place. `` You do n't have all the phoniness and tinsel you have here,'' he says, `` and even when you do it's more important. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the politicians are the stars. The Hollywood celebrities might get a tiny mention in the newspaper, which is the way it should be.'' `` From the Dead of Night'' is the first horror film for <PERSON> Boxleitner </PERSON>, who's more at home in the saddle. In his first series, `` How the West Was Won,'' which starred <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Arness </PERSON>, he played a fugitive forced to become a gunslinger. He co-starred with <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> in three `` Gambler'' movies as <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Montana </PERSON>, a role he has described as `` an airhead out <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>.'' He later teamed up again with <PERSON> Arness </PERSON> for a remake of `` Red River.'' He also starred briefly in the series `` Bring'Em Back Alive,'' based loosely on animal trapper and adventurer <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Buck </PERSON>, and most recently he spent four years co-starring with <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in `` Scarecrow and Mrs. King.'' In `` From the Dead of Night,'' he says, <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> `` carries the piece. I'm just there to help out. I'm her ex-boyfriend, and there's a triangle relationship between <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> and myself. My character's always out the door when you need him. He's an anthropologist off to a dig `` But when strange things start happening to <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON>, I'm the only one who realizes something really is going on. People all around her are dying and then coming back as living dead. The producers do n't want us to say zombies. It really is n't a zombie movie. It's a classic thriller.'' <PERSON> Boxleitner </PERSON> recently completed the movie-pilot for a new series for <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> called `` The Road Raiders.'' It's a World War II comedy-adventure he calls a `` combination of ` One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,' ` M-A-S-H,' ` The A-Team' and ` The Road Warriors.''' `` I feel like I'm more a part of this because I helped put it together,'' he says. `` I play a wonderful character called <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON>. He's Scarecrow and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Buck </PERSON> rolled into one. When we first meet him he's running a saloon in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> just before the Japanese invasion. `` He's totally unpatriotic. He's out for himself. He's like <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogart </PERSON> in ` Casablanca.' He's tough, rough-talking and always has a cigar stuck in his mouth. People will say I'm doing <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. I say I'm doing <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gable </PERSON>. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gable </PERSON> in ` Boom Town.''' <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Kusatsu </PERSON>, who was his right-hand man in `` Bring'Em Back Alive,'' will be a regular in `` The Road Raiders'' as the villain and <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON>' chief rival. `` Clyde and I are really the same guy,'' <PERSON> Boxleitner </PERSON> says. `` We're both con men trying to outdo the other.'' <PERSON> Boxleitner </PERSON> says he thinks the timing for the series is right because the third <PERSON> Indiana </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> movie, `` The Last Crusade,'' is due on Memorial Day. `` There's nothing like it on TV today,'' he says. `` I'm so tired of all these sitcoms. There is n't any comedy adventure on the air. I think this will fill that need.''

 When <PERSON> Yuriko </PERSON>, a Japanese-American dancer and choreographer, and her daughter, <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kikuchi </PERSON>, met with <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> in January 1988, they did n't realize their conversation would be the beginning of a year-long project. For mother and daughter, it meant a return to `` The King and I,'' a musical both have been associated with much of their professional lives. For <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>, it involved the chance to rework and refine one of his most famous creations, `` The Small House of Uncle <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>,'' a production number in `` The King and I.'' This ballet opens the second act of `` <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>' Broadway,'' a new, $ 7 million musical featuring numbers by the famed director and choreographer. The show spans 20 years, beginning with <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>' first show, `` On the Town,'' in 1944, and ending with his last musical, `` Fiddler on the Roof,'' in 1964 `` <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>' Broadway'' required meticulous preparation _ months of research and reconstruction of musical numbers, an unprecedented 22 weeks of rehearsal for its cast of more than 60 dancers and singers, and seven weeks of preview performances before the opening. The musical also includes such famous <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> creations as the frantic <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> <PERSON> Sennett </PERSON> ballet from `` High Button Shoes,'' `` I'm Flying'' from `` <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Pan </PERSON>,'' a suite of dances from `` West Side Story'' and a trio of strippers proclaiming `` You Got ta Have a Gimmick'' from `` Gypsy. Some musical numbers had to be re-created from scratch and the collective memories of their original dancers. That was n't the case with `` The Small House of Uncle Thomas,'' which is from one of <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hammerstein </PERSON>'s best-known musicals. <PERSON> Yuriko </PERSON>, a one-time member of the <ORGANIZATION> Martha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Graham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, performed in the original 1951 cast of `` The King and I,'' which starred <PERSON> Gertrude </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> and Yul Brynner. In the show, she played <PERSON> Eliza </PERSON> in `` The Small House of Uncle <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>.'' The number is a Siamese dance re-telling of <PERSON> Harriet </PERSON> <PERSON> Beecher </PERSON> <PERSON> Stowe </PERSON>'s `` Uncle <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>'s Cabin.'' Now she has helped <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> re-create it, and <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Kikuchi </PERSON> plays the role her mother originated 38 years ago. The ballet apparently was <PERSON> Hammerstein </PERSON>'s idea. It's mentioned in an early version of the `` The King and I'' script. The general story line for the ballet is in the script, as well as some narration and specific ideas for the dance. <PERSON> Hammerstein </PERSON> even had the idea of using real dogs _ poodles, in fact _ to chase the ballet's heroine. They never made it to <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>' final version. Instead, <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> created six distinct, separate dance segments to tell the story of <PERSON> Eliza </PERSON> crossing the ice, her pursuit by <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Legree </PERSON>, <PERSON> Legree </PERSON>'s drowning and the death of <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eva </LOCATION>. At first, the choreographer strove for a correct Oriental style. `` He was into authenticity, trying to choreograph through that,'' said <PERSON> Yuriko </PERSON>, recalling the intense four-week rehearsal period before the show went out of town in 1951. The dance style was modified as rehearsals went on, to accommodate <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON>' music which was more Broadway than Far Eastern. In rehearsal, <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> worked closely with <PERSON> Trude </PERSON> <PERSON> Rittman </PERSON>, who arranged the dance music, incorporating some of <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON>' melodies as well as her own work. The music was n't completed until Feb. 15, 1951, 11 days before the show began its pre-Broadway tryout in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION> `` The music and the choreography went along side by side,'' <PERSON> Yuriko </PERSON> says. `` They were created together.'' <PERSON> Yuriko </PERSON> remembers the choreography so well because she was the dance captain for the original production of `` The King and I.'' `` I had to know all the parts,'' she says. `` In my original music score, I have notes and have tried to preserve it as much as I can.'' <PERSON> Yuriko </PERSON> has directed or choreographed many revivals of `` The King and I,'' including the 1977 Brynner production that ran for more than a year on Broadway. It was in that revival that Miss <PERSON> Kikuchi </PERSON> danced the role of <PERSON> Eliza </PERSON>. Miss <PERSON> Kikuchi </PERSON> is a veteran of `` The King and I.'' As a child, she watched her mother in the original production and joined various revivals of the show herself, eventually playing most of the roles in `` The Small House of Uncle <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>.'' `` My mother would take me into a room and just teach it to me,'' Miss <PERSON> Kikuchi </PERSON> recalls. Auditions for the new show began in February of last year. <PERSON> Yuriko </PERSON> _ and later <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Kikuchi </PERSON> _ attended them and conferred with <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> on his choices. `` <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> took his time picking people, dancers he thought he could work with,'' says <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Kikuchi </PERSON>. `` He likes giving new, unexpected directions and having things accomplished right away.'' <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> kept refining the choreography _ at one point, taking out a major sequence or experimenting with various ideas on how to make it snow on stage. That effect, used in the original, was finally dropped. <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> has a reputation as a perfectionist. `` You have to be able to have stamina,'' <PERSON> Yuriko </PERSON> says. `` You have to be absolutely quick in changing from one minute to the next. If he likes a dancer, he will start to needle a little bit, to see how quickly they can react to change.'' The long rehearsal process for the show has n't been easy. <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> quickly replaced dancers if he found they were not working in a particular number. The show is the bottom line. `` He's looking for an intelligence and capability, not just to be able to do one step, polish it and get stuck there,'' <PERSON> Yuriko </PERSON> says. `` He loves to change until it is right _ and only he knows what is right.''

 On a continent where kings were once revered as gods, <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>'s half-dozen surviving monarchies include a diverse clutch of modernizing kings and a sultan who wields absolute power. King <PERSON> Bhumibol </PERSON> <PERSON> Adulyadej </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, the world's longest reigning monarch following the death Jan. 7 of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, has initiated several thousand rural projects and spends much of each year in the countryside personally helping peasants to design irrigation canals, improve crops and combat disease. Aside from <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, monarchs also reign in <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bhutan </LOCATION> in the Himalayias, <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Borneo </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. Unlike his remote predecessors in <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>, Harvard-educated King <PERSON> Birendra </PERSON> criss-crosses his mountainous nation and has set a goal of fulfilling the basic needs of an impoverished populace by the year 2000. In the kingdom of <LOCATION> Bhutan </LOCATION>, King <PERSON> Jigme </PERSON> <PERSON> Singye </PERSON> <PERSON> Wangchuk </PERSON> pores over economic development plans and almost daily deals with petitions submitted by subjects. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, whose funeral will be held Feb. 24, is widely credited with having helped <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s postwar economic miracle by preserving national unity and traditional virtues through his symbolic role. But the late emperor, who renounced his divinity after <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s defeat in World War II, spent most of his 62 years on the Chrysanthemum Throne behind the walls of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s Imperial Palace His son and successor, Emperor <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON>, 55, broke with tradition by marrying a commoner and has traveled with his family by train, thrown out the first ball at baseball games and mixed with his fellow Japanese at numerous public functions. Though he is expected to breach some of the barriers between emperor and subjects, <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> is unlikely to interact as intimately with his subjects and their daily problems as do the other Asian royals _ nor wield anywhere near as much tangible power. The most powerful and richest of the continent's five remaining hereditary monarchs is <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Sultan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassanal </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolkiah </PERSON>, an absolute ruler who resides in a 1,788-room palace and keeps some of his 200 horses in air-conditioned stables. Fortune magazine in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year named him the world's richest man, with assets estimated at $ 25 billion. Besides being head of state, he is also prime minister and defense minister and has included two of his brothers in the Cabinet to help rule over the oil-rich nation about the size of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> on the north coast of <LOCATION> Borneo </LOCATION> island. <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION>'s sultan harkens back to days when the pomp, pageantry and proclamations of hundreds of bluebloods _ kings, princes, sultans, maharajahs, newabs and nizams _ were as vital a part of <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> as its rice fields. But by mid-century, royal ranks had been thinned by communist revolutions, independence struggles and the spread of Western democracy. Other crowns have toppled in more recent times. The last emperor of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> abdicated in 1912. Communists ended imperial rule in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> at the end of World War II. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s independence from <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1947 sounded the knell for myriads of royals <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s kingdom ended amidst war and chaos in 1970, though Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, formerly the king, is still active as an exiled guerrilla faction leader. The last king of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaher </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON>, was toppled in 1973 and is exiled in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> but recently offered to help in a transitional government in his country. Today, there remain but five <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> hereditary kingdoms and <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, where every five years one of the country's sultans is elected a constitutional monarch. Nine of <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>'s 13 states have sultans who are constitutional heads of the state governments. They have no political power. Every five years these sultans meet to elect by secret ballot one of themselves to be the national king. By tacit agreement each state gets a turn at having its sultan king sooner or later. At the national level the king is the constitutional head of state but political power rests with prime minister. The present king of <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> is Sultan <PERSON> Mahmood </PERSON> <PERSON> Iskandar </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Jahore </LOCATION> state. His term expires this year. Today's <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> monarchies have deep roots and their forseeable futures appear secure. <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> is 125th in a line of emperors said to stretch back 2,600 years in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Though historians regard the first 14 emperors as figures of myth, the Japanese imperial line is still the world's oldest hereditary monarchy, and current public opinion polls favor its continuation <PERSON> Bhumibol </PERSON>, probably the most respected man in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, is heir to 750 years of monarchy. <PERSON> Bolkiah </PERSON> is <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION>'s 29th ruler while <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bhutan </LOCATION> both have centuries-old royal traditions. Although a constitutional monarch, the 61-year-old Thai king is regarded as semi-divine by some and widely viewed as having held the country together in wake of the coups and abortive power grabs that have marked recent decades. He openly intervened to stop a serious student-led uprising in 1973 and has in other moments of national crisis played a decisive behind-the-scenes role. Named king in 1946 and crowned four years later, when he was a jazz-loving teen-ager, <PERSON> Bhumibol </PERSON> was initially viewed as someone to be used by military strongmen. Instead, he gradually reversed the decline in prestige of the throne, largely by by-passing the elite to work for the mass of have-nots in the countryside. <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Birendra </PERSON>, 43, likewise has sought links with the rural poor, making frequent trips to remote areas to hand out relief supplies and sound out the problems of villagers. But knowledgable sources in <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> and neighboring <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> say much of the effort is negated by corruption within the royal family and its retainers _ an open secret in <LOCATION> Katmandu </LOCATION>, the capital. <PERSON> Birendra </PERSON> has initiated some political reforms during his 16-year rule but there are quiet critics of both the monarchy and limited democratic rights. The king himself, seen as a reincarnation of the Hindu god Vishnu, by law can not be criticized. In <LOCATION> Bhutan </LOCATION>, the publicity-shy, 33-year-old King <PERSON> Jigme </PERSON> <PERSON> Singye </PERSON> <PERSON> Wangchuk </PERSON> has continued his father's attempts at political evolution and improvement in the lives of his 1.4 million, largely illiterate people. `` Development is important but preserving our culture and our values is equally important,'' <PERSON> Jigme </PERSON> <PERSON> Singye </PERSON> has said. <LOCATION> Bhutan </LOCATION> was only opened up from its medieval seclusion by his reform-minded father. International aid agencies have been welcomed to <LOCATION> Bhutan </LOCATION> but mass tourism has not. Tourism is seen as a destroyer of the old ways upheld by the king, who always wears the traditional, robe-like `` kho'' _ even while playing basketball _ and is married to four sisters of noble line, another time-honored custom. <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION>'s politics are said to be among the most sterile in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> but the tiny state's 227,000 people have yet to show significant signs of discontent. Under the 42-year-old sultan, the country continues to prosper from its oil and natural gas reserves. Medical care and education are free and the per capita annual income of $ 21,000 is among the highest in the world. The sultan, who has snapped up hotels, companies and other investments around the world, moves freely among his subjects and is credited with a number of civic improvements.

 Long the butt of jokes as the nation's `` federal village,'' <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> is suffering further indignities and more ribbing this year Its city fathers doggedly insist that this is its 2,000 th birthday, and others insist it's not `` <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> is 2000!'' declare banners hanging from every light standard flanking the B-9 highway, a flat and colorless corridor that is the closest thing to a main street in this step-sister capital destined to be provisional forever. Local historians concede that <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>'s founding date of 11 B.C. is at bestan educated guess on literary grounds and probably a half century too late if one is talking about when it was settled. The first written reference to `` <PERSON> Bonna </PERSON>'' was found in Roman chronicles of the Rhineland war campaign carried out by <PERSON> Nero </PERSON> <PERSON> Claudius </PERSON> <PERSON> Drusus </PERSON> <PERSON> Germanicus </PERSON> between 13 B.C. and 9 B.C. Unsure of the point when <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> was founded, historians split the difference and came up with 11 B.C., says <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Rey </PERSON>, the municipal historian. `` This is in no way an archeological determination,'' he said in an interview. `` There is clear evidence that a village of <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> existed for several decades before the Drusus reference.'' Undaunted by details and determined to host a good party, city officials have embarked on an ambitious yearlong spree of concerts, exhibits, renovations and a massive fireworks display donated by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for the occasion. The $ 5.4-million extravaganza, however, has done more to stimulate the local penchant for self-deprecation than any sense of historical importance. Die Welt, the city's conservative daily newspaper, poked fun at the historical oversight and questioned the need to lavish public funds on the belated observance. Batches of souvenir mugs, cigarette lighters and other plastic baubles crowd the check-out counters of newsstands, gathering dust amid public apathy toward memorabilia attesting `` 1989 _ I was there'' and `` <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>'' spelled with a red lipstick kiss in place of the vowel. An unassuming hamlet on the <LOCATION> Rhine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> before its designation 40 years ago as seat of the new postwar government in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s Western sector, <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> has endured decades of ribbing as <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s Cinderella capital. `` It is easy to make fun of <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>,'' the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> ambassador, Sir <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bullard </PERSON>, wrote in a collection of essays about the 2000th or so anniversary. `` No one would award it the prize for Best Theatre, Best Opera, Best Restaurant or Best Newspaper. Best Intentions, perhaps.'' Indeed, <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> has little fame to claim, aside from being the birthplace in 1770 of composer <PERSON> Ludwig </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON>, who left in his teen-age years. <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> has little business aside from the federal government. A licorice factory, a pipe-organ works and a family-owned venture that stitches <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> flags are the city's most prominent industries. With fewer than 300,000 residents, including the nearby towns it has swallowed over the past few years, <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> is too small to rate a store that stays open later than 6:30 p.m. under the government's complicated commerce rules The small-town atmosphere of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s youngest capital has earned it the nickname `` Bundesdorf,'' or federal village, a play on its designation as <LOCATION> Bundeshauptstadt </LOCATION> _ federal capital. It was <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>'s very obscurity that earned it the dubious role of provisional capital in 1949 _ a verifiable anniversary that will be celebrated nationwide this spring. Following four years of Allied control after World War II, the West German government created in 1949 was intent on eventual reunification with the Soviet-controlled East German sector and did not want a prominent capital in an established city like <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>. A picturesque village just south of <LOCATION> Cologne </LOCATION> and a favorite summer stopover for the man who was to become the first chancellor, <PERSON> Konrad </PERSON> <PERSON> Adenauer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> was tabbed as a sufficiently low-profile spot from which to tide over affairs of state until <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, the real capital, could be reclaimed by a unified <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Despite 40 years and all-but-extinguished hopes for reunification, <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> has failed to take on a capital image. Reflecting official insistence that life here is temporary, government ministries occupy box-like concrete quarters that could easily be converted to private use. Hotel space is scarce. Embassies, though maintained in the tidy Rhineland tradition, tend toward the austere and outmoded. More renowned for its dreary weather than its political role, <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> endures a number of physical oddities that aggravate its small-time profile. The city is shaped something like a Q-Tip, with the university and a pedestrian shopping area forming the northern puff and a collage of diplomatic missions and housing compounds clustered at the south. Spanning the three-mile distance in between are the parallel B-9 highway and the railroad tracks, both flanked by a narrow stretch of federal buildings. The arrangement makes it difficult to walk or drive more than a city block east or west without encountering a barrier. `` There's something wrong with a capital that has to come to a halt every six minutes to let the trains roar through,'' joked one American resident. Newcomers to <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> often complain they feel depressed and groggy, a condition some psychologists here have termed the `` Rhine Syndrome'' and attributed to unusually low air pressure along the river. The spy novelist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> LeCarre </PERSON> captured <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>'s incongruous mix of scandal and boredom in his 1968 book `` A Small Town in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>,'' the tale of international intrigue set at the British Embassy. `` Sometimes the fog is a little colder. Then we call it winter,'' quipped <PERSON> LeCarre </PERSON>'s fictional diplomat, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Lisle </PERSON>. `` Sometimes it's warmer, and that's summer. You know what they say about <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>: either it rains or the level crossings are down.''

 <PERSON> Fatuma </PERSON> <PERSON> Issa </PERSON> bore her eighth child in a concrete shelter on the edge of the desert, accompanied only by a teen-age midwife she had never met. Mrs. <PERSON> Issa </PERSON>, 36 years old, strong and lucky, survived the delivery, but thousands of other women around the world in circumstances similar to hers die each day in childbirths or from complications related to pregnancy. The world's poorest nations account for about 90 percent of the half-million women who die each year in childbirth, from complications during pregnancy or from illegal abortions. International efforts are under way to save womens' lives, but changes are slow. In <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, 9 or 10 women die out of every 100,000 who give birth, compared with <LOCATION> Niger </LOCATION> and other parts of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> where the figure is 700 out of 100,000, according to <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> studies. And for every woman who dies, at least 10 are permanently handicapped by a complication during pregnancy or delivery, a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> Children's Fund -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- study reports. For each of the 500,000 women who die, at least two children are left orphans, says <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION>, calling the figures `` the statistics of shame.'' <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and others have taken steps in the last few years aimed at reducing maternal mortality rate by half in the next 25 years. The problem was forcefully illustrated in 1987 at a conference on maternal mortality in <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, by Dr. <PERSON> Attiya </PERSON> <PERSON> Inayatulla </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, when he told other delegates: `` It is intolerable that thousands of women die alone, in suffering, when they are in the process of giving life, and that we should do so little to help them.'' The day Mrs. <PERSON> Issa </PERSON> gave birth, a second international meeting was taking place about 50 miles down the road in <LOCATION> Niger </LOCATION>'s capital, <LOCATION> Niamey </LOCATION>. The meeting, under the auspices of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> groups, was designed to raise awareness of the problem among officials in 22 French-speaking African countries and to encourage them to help women and increase family planning. Health ministers were hammered with evidence that women hold the key to helping African nations struggle out of poverty. At the close of the meeting, delegates issued a declaration calling on African nations to do more to save the lives that are being squandered. Women, the declaration said, are not dying from the natural dangers of childbirth, but from bad health, ignorance, poverty and an inferior social status that is beyond the imagination of most women in the West. Every morning for most of the last 19 years, Mrs. <PERSON> Issa </PERSON> has risen before dawn to walk an hour for a bucket of water for cooking and washing. There is no water source in her village of helmut-shaped straw huts. After being fed a meager meal, her children scour for firewood in the vast expanse of dusty scrubland that supports few trees. Standing before a hip-high trough, she begins pounding millet, the staple of <LOCATION> Niger </LOCATION>'s diet. In blazing heat and dusty wind, she pounds the grain for eight hours, first in the morning and again in the afternoon. She then walks another hour for more water. She also plants and maintains a garden, feeds the livestock, cares for her eight children and elderly family members, cleans the hut and does what is demanded by her husband. He grows millet a few months of the year when it rains and spends hours talking with other men in the village. `` How can we ease the burdens that rest on the shoulders of African mothers,?'' <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaycox </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> vice president for <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, said at the <LOCATION> Niamey </LOCATION> conference. `` It is a question at the very heart of the development of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. African women work 12 to 16 hours a day, account for an average of 60 percent of what many nations produce and furnish 80 percent of what their families eat. `` The <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> mother is the foundation of African society,'' <PERSON> Jaycox </PERSON> said. `` Yet, she is also the most vulnerable member of that society. When food is in short supply, she is the one who goes without. When there is no doctor, she is the one who must deal with the risks associated with frequent pregnancies. ... And when the national quality of life plummets, she is the first to face the consequences.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Issa </PERSON> has experienced some of that. Throughout her childhood when food was short in the decades of recurring drought, her nine brothers and her father got first choice. She was lucky to have grown up at all, given the rate of child deaths in poor countries. The death rate for Third World children in their first year of life is 21 percent higher for girls than boys. Fourteen percent of girls suffer serious malnutrition, while only 5 percent of the boys do, a <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> study reports. Malnourished girls grow into undernourished women. Two-thirds of pregnant women in developing countries suffer from anemia and many more suffer vitamin deficiencies related to poor diet.

<TEXT>
 Bad health leads to problem pregnancies, but few women have access to medical care. Only 44 percent of Third World women in labor receive medical care. In many countries, about 80 percent of all births take place at home. About half the time, these women are alone, national studies report. <LOCATION> Niger </LOCATION>, like several <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> countries, has taken preliminary steps to improve health services for expectant mothers. The aging, concrete shelter where Mrs. <PERSON> Issa </PERSON> had her baby is one of about 80 maternity centers set up by the government around the nation. But in a poor country like <LOCATION> Niger </LOCATION>, where per capita income hovers around $ 260 a year, medical service is rudimentary at best and the standards of service differ widely. Even in the capital, where six multi-purpose complexes offer prenatal, obstetric and early pediatric care by trained midwives and health workers, the centers often lack sufficient antibiotics, pain killers and plasma. Rural facilities, frequently lack electricity and running water and are often more like the center here _ two crude rooms with a few yellowed cots and an inexperienced midwife the expectant mothers have never seen before. Despite the lack of health care and many dangers, African women continue to give birth too often, too early and too late. Mrs. <PERSON> Issa </PERSON> got married in her teens, like 70 percent of the women in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> but only 7 percent in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. She had her first child at 17. African women often produce their first baby around the age of 15 and continue having children every year or two until menopause. Mrs. <PERSON> Issa </PERSON> says she has had enough. `` I'm tired, really tired,'' she said, sitting on a dirty foam mattress without sheets the day after she gave birth. `` I want to take something to stop having babies. My husband may not want to accept it, but he's not the one who's tired'' she added in the tribal language <PERSON> Djerma </PERSON>, speaking through a midwife who translated. In rural areas, <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION> reports, 50 percent of the women who had their first child before 15 were dead by the age of 50 from causes linked to the trauma of frequent pregnancies. But only about 2 percent of African women have access to modern birth control or information on family planning. Laws, customs and religious beliefs stand in the way. Until Niger adopted a new birth control law last April, women needed written permission from their husbands even to visit a family planning center. In some countries, women need permission from their spouses to leave a village. They can not vote. They can neither own property nor inherit it. They can not decide whom to marry or divorce and they are prohibited from seeking an education. Female literacy in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> hovers around 6 percent, compared to 20 percent for African men and 99 percent for women and men in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` Women have no options,'' said <PERSON> Perdita </PERSON> <PERSON> Huston </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the London-based International Planned Parenthood. `` She may be desperately tired and not want another child, but she does n't want to disappoint her husband. She has to go on pleasing him. `` You can talk about safe motherhood until you are blue in the face and accomplish nothing until you convince the men.'' Ms. <PERSON> Huston </PERSON> added, however, that attitudes gradually are changing. Recurring drought and famine in <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> countries bordering the <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> produced a `` psychological shock'' to African governments, forcing them to reconsider limiting population growth. Chiefs of states and heads of families are realizing they do n't need any more mouths to feed World Bank lending for programs related to women's health and birth control will triple over the next five to eight years. `` We need to put our money where our mouth is,'' said <PERSON> M.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillette </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>'s director of the <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Country </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` But there is hope. Since the late 1970s ... there has been a tremendous reversal of spirit in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and a real intellectual grasp of the situation,'' <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Women are organizing and they are going to take care of this problem. Governments are recognizing the link between development and population control and they are changing policies. `` The last obstacle to family planning is the African man and he is waking up. There are forces loose in African society that he ca n't control anymore.''

 `` The Stars We Are'' -LRB- Capitol -RRB- _ <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Almond </PERSON> <PERSON> When </PERSON> was the last time you heard lyrics like these? `` I'll be a dragonfly, a butterfly, A secret or a little lie to test you, A song a verse a lullaby, A symphony ...'' `` In my hands the grains of sand, A thousand million moments of emotion _ Oh these my dreams are yours.'' `` I'm a teardrop in a storm, A storm at the end of the world.'' Set words like these to a rock beat and add strings, trumpets and other lush instrumentation, backing vocals with plenty of atmospheric reverb, and an occasional spoken-word passage. What do you have? <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON>? The <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blues </ORGANIZATION>? King Crimson? No, this is not a lost 1967 recording of early Art Rock. But <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Almond </PERSON> and his group, <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magia </ORGANIZATION>, exhibit a youthful romanticism that has been missing from rock since the <ORGANIZATION> Flower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> days. That's refreshing as a break from the current formulas, a revitalization of an almost extinct style. And it's reassuring to know that even in the late'80s a songwriter can refer to himself as someone `` who is afraid of getting jaded.'' But youthful romanticism and idealism can lead to youthful excess, and this record is often both trite and overwrought in its efforts to achieve poetry. In a song called `` The Very Last Pearl,'' Almond aptly sings, `` Call me romantic, Call me deluded.'' He concludes another song by drawing out the phrase, `` And I ... a fool ... for love!'' Really, now. Amid such excess, however, there are some good songs on this album. `` Only the Moment'' and `` Tears Run Rings'' in particular stand out as well-realized pop songs that manage to escape being overdone. All it takes is a little restraint. _ By <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` Wall of Pride'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> and the <PERSON> Howlers </PERSON> <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> and the Howlers play the kind of loud, rowdy rock' n' roll that sounds best late at night in a noisy, crowded bar. That does n't mean you have to invite a bunch of strangers over to your apartment and throw beer bottles against the wall to enjoy `` Wall of Pride,'' the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> band's second album. But make no mistake, it's party music all the way. Transferring such bar-band energy to a record is no easy task but producer <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Manning </PERSON>, who has worked with blues-rockers Z.Z. Top and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorogood </PERSON>, has a way with this sort of thing. The focus is not on the songs, which are good if not overly distinctive, as much as the sound itself, especially the sandpaper growl of lead singer <PERSON> Omar </PERSON>, who also plays a raw, scraping guitar. He's helped by a strong rhythm section and keyboard player <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Scortia </PERSON>, who apparently is n't afraid to occasionally use his elbows instead of his fingers to pound the piano. The album's two cover songs are interesting: a remake of the Animals' `` We Got ta Get Out of This Place,'' which abandons any pretense to the subtlety of the original; and a version of <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>'s `` Down in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>,'' recorded in an odd, muffled sound that recalls the great bluesman's loping style. The originals, most of which are written or co-written by an otherwise unidentified <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dykes </PERSON>, range from the all-out boogie of `` Rattlesnake Shake'' to the rhythm and blues-flavored `` King's Ransom. That's not a very far range, but these guys do n't claim to be Renaissance men. They're Howlers. _ By <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Danko </PERSON>'s life has been a musical carnival since The Band played its last waltz at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Winterland </ORGANIZATION> in 1976 And the bass player wants all to know that he's alive and well and has no intention of quitting the business <PERSON> Danko </PERSON> took the low road after the group known loosely as `` <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON>'s backup band,'' and sometimes called by a myriad of other names _ <PERSON> Levon </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Hawks </ORGANIZATION>, the Crackers and the <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Squires </LOCATION> _ decided that 16 years on the road was enough. They retired as a group. But not as individuals. `` The last 10 years I've been documenting my shows _ every night that I play,'' said <PERSON> Danko </PERSON>, who recently appeared with ex-Band keyboardist <PERSON> Garth </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> on `` Mountain Stage,'' <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>'s upbeat and eclectic music show broadcast from <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>. `` There's <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Butterfield </PERSON>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON>, <PERSON> Levon </PERSON> <PERSON> Helm </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> ... I've made some of these tapes available,'' he said. `` I have a mail-order company. `` I hope people do n't think I was retired. I'm too young to retire. I'm 45.'' <PERSON> Danko </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> _ where The Band's legendary house and recording studio, <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pink </ORGANIZATION>, was located _ has concentrated on raising three children ages 18 through 21 and playing small clubs. `` Music's been good to me. Hopefully, I've been good to it,'' <PERSON> Danko </PERSON> said in an interview before leaving for <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>. `` I felt good about it yesterday. I'll likely feel good about it tomorrow. It beats working.'' <PERSON> Danko </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, who have played together several times over the past few months, have not had as high a visibility as <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, The Band's guitarist, and Helm, the group's drummer. <PERSON> Danko </PERSON> also has performed with Helm and <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> over the years. He also sang on <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s eponymous LP. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> released his first solo album last year and had a hit. Helm has carved out a career in films, appearing in such movies as `` Coal Miner's Daughter'' and `` The Right Stuff.'' The Band had a brief reunion tour two years ago; it was cut short by pianist <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON>'s suicide. <PERSON> Danko </PERSON> said not to rule out another reunion attempt despite differences between Helm and <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, both of whom viewed themselves as the group's leader. `` Never say never,'' <PERSON> Danko </PERSON> said. `` I did n't speak to <PERSON> Robbie </PERSON> for while, but it was n't because of a conflict. We just never ran into one another.'' The Band began as rockabilly singer <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>' backup crew in the early 1960s and eventually got the name the <ORGANIZATION> Hawks </ORGANIZATION> from touring with him. <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> moved to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> with his drummer, Helm, where rockabilly was just beginning. But his band soon took flight with its own distinctive style: a blend of Motown, folk, rock and country. They caught the eye of the folk singer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> who brought the group to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> where <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON> started playing with them. The Hawks, without Helm, toured with <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON> in 1965 -'66 with <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> on When they returned, they rented a house in upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, got Helm to come up from the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and wrote some songs. They collaborated with <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON> on `` Tears of Rage,'' but saved some tunes for their classic first LP, `` Music From Big Pink.'' They later recorded such albums as `` The Band'' and `` Stage Fright,'' and such songs as `` The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down,'' `` The Weight,'' `` Up On Cripple Creek'' and `` Life Is a Carnival.'' When the Band decided to retire, they did so with a splash. Their final concert on Thanksgiving Day in 1976 at <LOCATION> Winterland </LOCATION>, called `` The Last Waltz,'' featured appearances by <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Joni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON>, <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Clapton </PERSON>, Muddy Waters and <PERSON> Emmylou </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> and others connected with the Band's career. It resulted in a documentary directed by <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scorcese </PERSON> and a legendary live album of the same name. The Band will be installed in the Canadian Music Hall of Fame on March 12. Aside from the Arkansas-born Helm, the others were natives of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. `` It's a pretty big deal with the Canadians,'' <PERSON> Danko </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakeshott </PERSON> is 87 years old, lives in a stone cottage in <LOCATION> Dorset </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, and is, in the minds of many, one of the century's great philosophers. <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> <PERSON> Giamatti </PERSON>, a teacher of Italian, English and comparative literature, was president of <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and is about to become the commissioner of baseball in April. The two men, seemingly so distant in place and circumstance, are actually close intellectual neighbors. By happy coincidence, each has just published collections of essays describing their views on education and the idea of the university. Both have fashioned elegantly written defenses of liberal education and the ideal of the university as a place of civil conversation; a place where, as <PERSON> Oakeshott </PERSON> puts it, a student may `` come to seek his intellectual fortune'' undistracted by the press of time or outside worries. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> Learning: <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakeshott </PERSON> on Education'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, $ 20 -RRB- was edited by <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> and a friend and unabashed admirer of the British philosopher who is professor emeritus at the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Giamatti </PERSON>'s `` A Free and Ordered Space: The Real World of the University'' -LRB- <PERSON> W.W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Norton </PERSON>, $ 19.95 -RRB- consists of 23 essays, many of them originally delivered as speeches at commencements or convocations. The Oakeshott collection, in particular, represents a welcome rescue operation, an opportunity for Americans to discover a major British philosopher and teacher of enormous wit, charm and modesty. His essays add a civilizing voice to the current school reform debate. For universities and their supporters, the two collections could n't be more timely. Taken together, they represent a forceful rebuttal to `` The Closing of the American Mind,'' the curmudgeonly best seller by <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> political scientist <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> which charged American higher education with selling out its intellectual responsibilities to 1960s hooliganism. The introductions in both collections leave no doubt that <PERSON> Oakeshott </PERSON> and <PERSON> Giamatti </PERSON> are aiming straight at such Bloom-and-doomsayers. <PERSON> Giamatti </PERSON>, for one, blames his academic colleagues for their silence under siege, and urges them to make their mission better understood to an increasingly impatient public. `` A parent who hungers to know, for instance, why a child's college experience costs so much or, worse, has seemed so unsatisfactory or lacking in connectedness with anything in the past will have heard very little from higher education about its issues or its problems,'' <PERSON> Giamatti </PERSON> writes `` Small wonder that <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON>'s book is a best seller.'' <PERSON> Oakeshott </PERSON>'s essays are more difficult, both intellectually and for their use of British idiom. The collection includes some of <PERSON> Oakeshott </PERSON>'s least-known works, some of which appeared as much as 40 years ago only in out-of-print journals. Over the years, <PERSON> Oakeshott </PERSON> has acquired a small but devoted army of academtic adherents. He is perhaps best known for his definitive introduction to <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hobbes </PERSON>' `` Leviathan.'' But his other works, notably `` Experience and Its Modes,'' and `` Rationalism in Politics,'' have become bibles for those who have watched with horror the rise of social science and technocracy on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> campuses at the expense of history and the humanities. <PERSON> Oakeshott </PERSON> describes the university as an idea, more than a place _ a community where scholars, teachers and pupils engage each other in ceaseless skepticism. Universities are, and must remain, blessedly `` useless'' beyond the enjoyment of learning they offer participants. His essays, including several in the present collection, also constitute a powerful defense of political conservatism and have thus been quoted regularly by columnists such as <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON>. Yet Oakeshott himself has always been far more good-natured in his views than those who have most often invoked his name. Still, practical-minded Americans often find a number of his beliefs difficult to swallow. For example, he describes the undergraduate as `` not a child, not a beginner. He has already had his schooling elsewhere, and has learned enough, morally and intellectually, to take a chance with himself upon the open sea ...'' That description might seem a bit elitist to some, leaving little room in the modern university for remediation. Further, <PERSON> Oakeshott </PERSON> completely and defiantly rejects utilitarian justifications for higher education: `` The current talk about the ` mission' and the ` function' of a university goes rather over my head,'' he writes. `` It assumes that there is something called ` a university,' a contrivance of some sort, something you could make another of tomorrow if you had enough money, of which it is sensible to ask, ` What is it for?''' Or again: `` A university ... has a place in the society to which it belongs, but that place is not the function of contributing to some other kind of activity in the society but of being itself and not another thing.'' The historian of Oakeshottian bent, for example, practices history for its own sake, not for its supposed `` lessons'' or other real or imagined uses. Viewed in purely practical terms, <PERSON> Oakeshott </PERSON>'s scholar does n't give a hoot about whether his activity is of use, except insofar as it is interesting to him He wants to understand for understanding's sake. <PERSON> Giamatti </PERSON>, as a former university president, is far more willing to explore scholarship's connections with other segments of society. But his central view of the university as a `` free and open space'' is remarkably compatible with the Oakeshott ideal. `` Its essence,'' <PERSON> Giamatti </PERSON> writes, `` is that give-and-take, that civil conversation in its innumerable forms. When that conversation, the to-and-fro of ideas, is stymied or foreclosed or frozen, when the questing for truth is told that it must cease because there is only one Truth and it is Complete, then the institution in its essence is chilled and its life threatened.'' In an essay titled `` The Earthly Use of a <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Giamatti </PERSON> confronts an all-too-American challenge to higher learning: <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> education `` is all very well, but how does someone make a living with this joy of learning and pleasure in the pursuit of learning? What is the earthly use of all this kind of education later on, in the practical, real world? `` These are not trivial questions, though the presuppositions behind them puzzle me somewhat. I am puzzled, for instance, by the unexamined assumption that the ` real world' is always thought to lie outside or beyond the realm of education. I am puzzled by those who think that ideas do not have reality or that knowledge is irrelevant to the workings of daily life.'' It's comforting to know that such thoughts still occupy the man who might adjudicate baseball's balk rule come next Spring.

<HEAD>Washington's Birthday Key Ritual In American Culture</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It may seem like just a day off, but next Monday marks a key ritual for affirming the nation's identity by linking up to a legend. With its ancestor worship and retelling of myths, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s Birthday serves the cultural purpose of instructing the young and reminding grown-ups about what it is to be an American, social science experts say `` He was in a way an ideal American, and so in celebrating his birthday the society celebrates itself. It is important for society to do that because in this way it reinforces its values,'' said <PERSON> Liah </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenfeld </PERSON>, an assistant professor of sociology and social studies at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` American identity for the most part begins with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kertzer </PERSON>, an anthropology professor at <ORGANIZATION> Bowdoin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. He is `` the point of reference -LRB- for -RRB- what it means to be an American.'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> was born Feb. 22, 1732, but the federal observance falls on Feb. 20 this year. Some states combine the holiday with <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s Feb. 12 birthday and call it Presidents Day. Ancestor worship, is common in the world's cultures, the experts said. Enshrining heroes in myths is a way `` of really providing our own identity by attaching ourselves to a past that is larger than life ... To do that we have to regularly have some ritual observances to keep those myths and those heroes alive,'' said <PERSON> Kertzer </PERSON>, author of the recent `` Ritual, Politics and Power.'' Even if many Americans see <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s Birthday as just a chance for a three-day weekend, it still does its cultural job, said <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, professor of anthropology and urban studies at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orleans </ORGANIZATION>. `` A good ritual does not have to have many participants to work, and they do n't have to be enthusiastic,'' she said. `` Have you ever been to a funeral in which you were secretly cheering?'' The important thing is that somebody observes the ritual, <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said. `` Our personal feelings about this are totally immaterial. These structures existed before we were born, and they will continue after we are dead.'' The holiday is observed more directly in schools, where it instructs the young, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>, sociology professor at <ORGANIZATION> Vanderbilt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. So what does <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> represent? There's honesty, as in the cherry tree confession, and strength, as in flinging the silver dollar across the <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. He also is portrayed as a loving and caring father of the country. `` People need fathers. This is a myth about how fathers should act,'' said <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, adding that the Valley Forge legend provides a classic hero myth. `` Heroes must go through a time of testing, in which they must triumph. They have to have followers and they have to have a sort of vision, even if it's not shared at the time with other people, of what they're doing.'' People `` want to know <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> could n't get supplies from the <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and is n't that typical? The vision of great leaders is not shared by the legislature. This is sort of a basic American myth about what kind of society do we have, and how did it come into being.'' Yet <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is the statesman with the formal wig as well as the revolutionary leader, said <PERSON> Kertzer </PERSON>. `` You do n't think of a heated personality, sort of a rabble rouser'' like <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>. By remembering <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as a statesman-revolutionary, `` we deal with the ambiguity of our notion of a nation that was born with revolution, and yet a nation that is very conservative.'' For that purpose, he said, `` <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s perfect.''

<HEAD>Geologists Hindered In Effort To Prevent Natural Disaster Deaths</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MENLO PARK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Weeks before <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Nevado </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON> volcano erupted, melting glaciers and unleashing torrents of mud that buried 25,000 people, geologists drafted a map showing exactly where the muck would flow. The 17,700-foot volcano started spewing ash Sept. 11, 1985. Scientists gave the map to officials Oct. 7 and urged them to start emergency preparations. A newspaper published the map a couple days later. But survivors of the deadly Nov. 13 eruption complained they were n't warned. `` There were no evacuations ordered as a result of the map,'' which also may not have been understood by residents who saw it, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geological Survey volcanologist <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Tilling </PERSON>. `` That should n't have happened. The whole emergency response network failed and, as a result, thousands died.'' Time and again geologists have warned of impending disasters or urged that steps be taken to reduce the death toll in future catastrophes. Many of these efforts have been ignored because of politics, economic concerns, uncertainty in their predictions, communications failures and the very human tendency to avoid unpleasant realities. `` Geophysicists more than once warned builders of the high seismic activity in northwest <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> said after the Dec. 7 earthquake that rocked a part of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> known for centuries for deadly quakes. At least 24,000 people died, entombed in collapsed adobe huts, stone homes and inadequately reinforced concrete-slab buildings. `` It's not enough to assess hazards. Something has to be done with this information,'' Geological Survey scientist <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> told 200 officials in November when the agency held a `` Geohazards'88'' symposium in <LOCATION> Menlo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> on how science can save lives from quakes, volcanoes and landslides. Earthquakes, landslides, tidal waves, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, volcanic eruptions and wildfires killed more than 2.8 million people worldwide in the past 20 years, and caused up to $ 100 billion in property damage, said a 1987 <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> report. `` The impacts of natural hazards are increasing and will continue to do so unless the world community takes concerted action,'' the report said, urging a worldwide scientific effort in the 1990s to reduce the natural disaster toll. Many nations lack the money or political and social institutions capable of acting, said <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> of the Office of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Foreign Disaster Assistance. `` The greatest human burden from natural catastrophes falls on the poor, powerless and helpless victims in the Third World.''

<HEAD>It's OK To Count On Your Fingers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Schoolteachers have scolded children for counting with their fingers for decades, but some researchers say finger-counting can keep good students good and help not-so-good students become better. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegler </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerkman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mellon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> psychology professors, say their studies show there's nothing wrong with finger-counting, and teachers probably should show their students how to do it correctly. `` They're going to do it anyway. Every teacher we've talked about this with has told us that telling children not to use their fingers does n't work ... We think children are right to do this because if you do n't know the answer very well, then it's better to be right than to be wrong,'' <PERSON> Siegler </PERSON> said. Good students rely on their memories more than not-so-good students or perfectionists to solve mathh and reading problems, according to a study of 80 children at an elementary school in suburban <LOCATION> Monroeville </LOCATION>. When they could n't remember an answer good students turn to backup methods, including sounding out words, using a dictionary, counting up from a number to add or down from a number to subtract _ or using their fingers. Perfectionists used backup methods even when they could remember the answer, frequently taking longer to solve problems as a result, <PERSON> Siegler </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kerkman </PERSON> discovered. Not-so-good students gave the most incorrect answers, as expected, but also displayed poor finger-counting skills. Poor students may do poor work because they are bad at backup strategies, including finger-counting, <PERSON> Siegler </PERSON> said. `` It's inefficient to be wrong, because you do n't learn from it. If you do a problem and generate a wrong answer in arithmetic, there's nothing much to be learned. All that can happen is that you're going to connect that wrong answer to a problem, and that will harm the process of learning the right ones.''

<HEAD>Jet Propulsion Laboratory Produces Mars Movie</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> scientists have created an animated three-dimensional movie of Mars, seen from the view of an astronaut flying at 160,000 mph through the planet's canyons and above its volcanoes. `` Mars the Movie'' lasts about two minutes, and its simulated flight ranges from three miles to 500 miles above the surface of the red planet. The film `` takes the viewer on a tour through <PERSON> Valles </PERSON> <PERSON> Marineris </PERSON>, a canyon system near the Martian equator that stretches farther than the distance from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and over <LOCATION> Tharsis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Montes </LOCATION>, a series of giant volcanoes more than twice the size of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Everest </LOCATION>,'' the space agency said.

<HEAD>Drug Promising For Non-Surgical Treatment Of Enlarged Prostate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A drug used to combat high blood pressure shows promise as an alternative to surgery for treating prostate enlargement that afflicts up to 4 million <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> men, a scientist says. The prostate gland surrounds the neck of the bladder and the urethra in men, and manufactures part of the fluid in semen. For unknown reasons, it gradually enlarges after age 35; most men develop symptoms if they live long enough, said Dr. <PERSON> Perinchery </PERSON> <PERSON> Narayan </PERSON>, chief of urology at the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. Two million to 4 million men suffer prostate enlargement to the point that the gland squeezes the urethra to impede urine flow from the bladder, <PERSON> Narayan </PERSON> said. Symptoms range from frequent urination and burning sensations to infections, urine retention and life-threatening kidney failure. A preliminary study of 22 men found that four weeks of treatment with the drug terazosin provided 30 percent to 50 percent improvement in urine flow, he said. `` It looks like there's enough relief that our patients can avoid surgery. Whether this is permanent remains to be seen.'' Terazosin is used to treat high blood pressure because it relaxes smooth muscle in blood vessels. Researchers believe it has the same effect on smooth muscle in the urinary tract, opening the urethra despite the enlarged prostate. The drug does n't appear to reduce the size of the enlarged gland. The <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, plan to try terazosin on more 50 - to 75-year-old men with enlarged prostates Other scientists in the nationwide study are at <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin-Madison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tulane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Veterinarians Provide `Well-Cow Care' Through HMOOOOOOOOOOOOO</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Dairy cows are getting prepaid medical care under a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> program modeled on health maintenance organizations. `` In the past, veterinarians have been thought of as people who provide individual animal medicine or emergency care,'' said <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitmore </PERSON>, head of food animal medicine and surgery at the university's College of Veterinary Medicine. `` But this is a new program to broaden the use and role of the veterinarian in the animal industry.'' For a fixed monthly fee based on herd size, the college provides all medical services, including hospitalization when needed and routine biweekly visits university spokesman <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> called `` well-cow care.'' The program helps owners keep medical costs under control, allows the veterinarians to influence cattle management and use a variety of skills, and also provides veterinary students with valuable experience. `` We study them as they grow and monitor them all the way through so we raise these animals efficiently, grow them at the right rate, breed them at the right time, calve them at the right time and manage for maximum milk production and profit,'' <PERSON> Whitmore </PERSON> said. `` The veterinarian wants to be viewed as a herd health consultant, not just a person who delivers emergency care.''

<HEAD>Isolation With No Sense of Time Skews Woman's Rhythms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CARLSBAD, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A month in the absence of any timepieces has altered the waking and sleep patterns of an Italian woman who's spending five months in a cave to simulate the experiences of astronauts on long voyages <PERSON> Stefania </PERSON> <PERSON> Follini </PERSON>, who entered a 100-square-foot Plexiglas cubicle in Lost Cave on Jan. 13, has been sleeping 10 hours and staying awake 20, said <PERSON> Maurizio </PERSON> <PERSON> Montalbini </PERSON>, leader of the U.S.-Italian research team. Those cycles likely will lengthen more, said <PERSON> Montalbini </PERSON>, who once spent seven months in a cave. Since Jan. 13, the <PERSON> Ancona </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, interior designer's only contact with the outside world has been through a personal computer, on which she relays results of tests of concentration and brain-wave activity. Her concentration also seems to have sharpened during her first weeks of isolation, said <PERSON> Montalbini </PERSON>, who chose a cave in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for the tests because he wanted to be close to researchers from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and universities. Dr. <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> DeFrance </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, said the <PERSON> Follini </PERSON> experiment will help researchers design a study in which astronauts will go on a mock space voyage to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> is particularly interested in the Italian study because previous experiments have suggested prolonged isolation weakens the body's resistance to disease. <PERSON> DeFrance </PERSON>'s specific interest is in attention disorders. Ms. <PERSON> Follini </PERSON> periodically attaches electrodes to her head for brain scans, and she takes tests on a computer that gauge her attention span. Attention span `` may be disrupted in a number of different ways,'' <PERSON> DeFrance </PERSON> said. `` Each disruption may have its own pattern or signature. The disruption may be unique. It may be able to pinpoint what brain pathways are weakened. `` We may be able to develop methods for refreshing attention, so that astronauts can conduct their activities at a high level and very competently.''

 Beachgoers can bare as much, or as little, as they dare this summer and still stay in the fashion swim. Shapely and scantily-clad models notwithstanding, `` the big news is more coverage, because the population in general is aging,'' says <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>, merchandise manager for <PERSON> Jantzen </PERSON> swimwear. But the trim and the bold can still show off in <ORGANIZATION> Gottex </ORGANIZATION>'s trendy Viewpoint line or in <LOCATION> Darling </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>, a line that is `` definitely more risque'' than the mainstream, notes designer <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Henriquez </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jantzen </PERSON> salutes the trend toward a feminine, dignified look: floral patterns with lower legs, soft shirring, draping and skirts to cover the hips, thighs and stomach. Dots or stripes provide a clean, athletic feeling and textures liven up solid colors. `` Blue-greens will always be our No. 1 seller, but we're also seeing a lot of reds and corals and pinks mixed together: they're very flattering on a lot of skin tones,'' says <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> Bikinis offer new variety: some skirted, some with a high or rolled waistband for camouflage; bandeau or underwire tops team diversity and practicality. Some suits offer a `` power net lining'' for tummy control. Dressy, wash-and-wear cover-ups _ perhaps a polyester or cotton jumpsuit or wrapped jacket matching your swimsuit pattern _ are de rigueur for that stroll through the ship or hotel lobby. Women from 18 to 40 who want to flaunt a `` very high leg and a lot of rear'' can take the plunge with <PERSON> Darling </PERSON> <PERSON> Rio </PERSON>, sizzling in bold prints, little flowers, metallics and solid blocks of two or three colors _ especially red, lime, yellow or peach. These bikinis sport a triangle top, bustier or a traditional bandeau; one-piece suits highlight the shoulders. `` We have n't gotten to the point of padded shoulders at the beach, although <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is doing that,'' notes <PERSON> Henriquez </PERSON> <PERSON> Henriquez </PERSON> says even Midwesterners are buying her racy line _ maybe not for their local beach, but `` they're definitely wearing it when they're traveling.'' <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Lomas </PERSON>, Viewpoint's designer, favors 1960s' tie-dye looks, the Mexican and <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> influence and `` a lot of hot colors: red, orange, yellow, pink.'' The suits, designed for physically fit women from 16 to 40, are fun, clean, athletic and sexy _ some with suspenders. But even here, `` the higher leg is not really that strong this summer,'' notes <PERSON> Lomas </PERSON>. Color blocks, if properly shaped and proportioned, also can `` make the person's body look great,'' even if it's less than perfect, she says. Viewpoint's T-shirt bikinis are sold in three pieces. Women who've had enough sun can pull the ribbed, cotton muscle shirt over the suit; but wearing the extremely clingy shirt without the bikini top `` is a European style. The beaches here do n't call for that,'' says <PERSON> Lomas </PERSON>.

 After a few seasons of flamboyance, French high fashion designers are back to basics with softly stated summer and spring clothes. The mood was breezy and feminine in the lines of 20 designers who unveiled thousands of original outfits in winter previews for audiences that included movie stars and VIPs. The dresses, each costing $ 10,000 or more, are custom-made for a mere 3,000 women. Yet they set trends for much of the fashion industry worldwide. There were airy chiffons and silks in a myriad of pastels and gentle prints, bias cuts, body-hugging sheaths and bustiers, oversized pants and pleats. Evening wear looked regal with generous use of embroidery, lace, jewels, and gold and silver applique. Italian couture king <PERSON> Valentino </PERSON> made his <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> debut, ruffling feathers in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and dazzling the French couture crowd with a stunning look that was sweet and sexy, even in prim navy and white. Indian themes were dominant. <PERSON> Valentino </PERSON> decorated his evening jackets with gold and silver elephants, and <ORGANIZATION> Per </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spook </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Lacroix </PERSON> served up palettes of subtle beiges and creams. <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Bohan </PERSON>'s new designs included a sari effect done with feathery light silk draped around the bodice and over the shoulder <PERSON> Yves </PERSON> <PERSON> Saint-Laurent </PERSON>'s collection featured slits cut high above the thigh, deep-cut necklines, and his signature feminized tailoring. Except for <PERSON> Saint-Laurent </PERSON>, it was adieu to oversized shoulders, miniskirts and pouffy ball gowns. The lines were fluid and graceful, with wispy chiffons and soft crepes for both daytime and after dark. Hems, for the most part, skimmed the knee, though many designers showed the leg with asymmetrical wraparounds and skirts, long and short, slit from hem to waist. Chanel, however, opted for calf-length pleated skirts for daytime wear, especially good in navy and cream. Worn under long tunic jackets and with two-tone flats, they had a schoolgirl charm reminiscent of the 1930s. The latest evolution of the classic <ORGANIZATION> Chanel </ORGANIZATION> jacket showed a longer cut, fastening with a single button just above the waist; the newest Chanel buttons were pearl. A major switch was a smooth leather purse, superseding the chain-handled quilted bag as a Chanel status symbol. For most designers, it was the year of the dress. <PERSON> Givenchy </PERSON> took the simple shirtwaist classic and dressed it up or down, depending on the time of day. Pleated or belted, cinched or cravated, dresses were aimed to appeal to those with conservative tastes who still like a touch of glamor. Pant lovers, thin and not-so-thin, will be comfortable in Spook's pajama pants worn under layers of vests for day or under colorful embroidered tunics for after dark <PERSON> Saint-Laurent </PERSON> showed an array of menswear-styled trousers for day and evening wear. Cut to just above the ankle, they created a long, slimming line flowing down through high heeled pumps. They were shown with suit jackets that dipped dramatically or with with ultra-sheer chiffon blouses. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Laroche </PERSON> was this year's winner of the Golden Thimble award for the most beautiful collection with his classy designs in brilliant colors: sunbursts of yellow, juicy reds and bright oranges melting into the palest of springy pastels. One of his designs was an elegantly simple black sheath that was high-necked in the front but backless to the waist and circled by white-edged ruffling. <PERSON> Lacroix </PERSON> abandoned the extravagance of his previous collections and came up with feminine pastels, draping chiffon in flowing pantskirts and embroidered and bejeweled raw silk. He used lace and gathered organza for a dreamy, cloudlike effect. <PERSON> Lacroix </PERSON>'s palette was strong with sandy beiges evoking the desert, mixing melon and pistachio pastels, poppy reds and Persian blue, black, white and navy. In most of the collections, curves and busts were emphasized with drapery, belts and buttons. The exception was <PERSON> Lacroix </PERSON>, who covered them with trapeze and triangular shapes. <PERSON> Torrente </PERSON> maintained Parisian chic with daytime dresses of polka dot pastels with kick pleats topped with bows, striking tiered dresses, and wide-brimmed hats. For after dark, there were draped chiffons and crepes, held at the shoulder or waist with jewels or bows. <PERSON> Hanae </PERSON> <PERSON> Mori </PERSON> also toasted femininity with her floor-length yellow draped sheath, set off by a line of ruffles running from shoulder to toe. <PERSON> Nina </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricci </PERSON> produced a large collection of simple but beautiful clothes in rich fabrics for all times of day. There were wide soft pants, pleated and swirling skirts and cinched waists, creating a nostalgic prettiness. For after hours, <PERSON> Ricci </PERSON> served up an understated but elegant long sleeveless evening gown in peach crepe satin with pleated bodice and back.

 <PERSON> Emanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ungaro </PERSON> has presented a sumptuous collection for spring and summer, softening his structured look in defiance of the sweet and pretty trend dominating French haute couture. <PERSON> Ungaro </PERSON> all but ignored pleats and wide, breezy pants and minimized the draping he has used lavishly in earlier shows. He showed well-defined lines, bold colors and lots of glitter. <PERSON> Ungaro </PERSON> also had a bold approach to the flowers that have sprung up everywhere for spring and summer. Mixing colors generously, he played dramatic floral prints on jackets and tops against small flower prints on the dresses or pants underneath. In one outfit, a black checked jacket was paired with a floral-print dress. Soft notes included petticoats under flouncy skirts and cinched waists, and lots of silky fabric. There were a few examples of what is becoming the classic soft look for summer, including a gauzy white floor-length dress with halter top and draped bodice, set off with a gold medallion and gold lame at the midriff. Jackets, long or short but all with tightly cinched waists, often were ruffled at the shoulder-top for a swept-up wing effect reminiscent of royalty. The softness came when the jacket was removed to reveal a pretty strapless, flowery dress. <PERSON> Ungaro </PERSON> used gold and silver extensively, in brocade or weaved into the fabric. Pants were soft and most were tailored with thin legs and worn under jackets or in pants suits. Hemlines were above the knee, but jacket lengths varied from just below the waist to dress length and beyond.

 While the miniskirt is still a hot item on the streets of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, despite the temperatures, the shop windows are showing a spring and summer of 1989 that will be long, loose and romantic. The new look for the warmer days ahead, proposed by the top Italian designers at their ready-to-wear presentations in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> and already appearing in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s more exclusive shops, is soft and serene. Gone is the aggressiveness of a bold hemline, a hugged hip or a padded shoulder. Instead, the accent is on a rounded silhouette, with small shoulders, gently tapered waistline and long hemline. Super-soft fabrics underline the ethereal quality of the new look, as does the predominance of rose and cream-colored shades. Pants, which competed with the mini craze this winter, continue their popularity for spring and summer. For the most part they are ample, and often cropped at the calf. After a long absence from the fashion scene, hip pants are back again. Another look from the past is the nautical theme, with high-waisted sailor pants and sailor-suit collars on crisp white blouses and jackets. The color here is rigorously navy blue, or navy and white stripes. Nautical symbols appear in prints and on jewelry. After the freedom of the miniskirt, Italian designers are calling on women to hark back to the discipline of their school days in prim, perfectly pleated linen suits and dresses with demure white collars. Topped by a broad-brimmed straw hat, white gloves and flat shoes, the look oozes innocence. Naturally, at night these school girls blossom into blushing debutantes in diaphanous strapless ballgowns right out of the 1950s. There also is the ethnic lure, a purely South Seas summer look that will appear in the shops later this year. Here sarong skirts, bandeau bras, and hip pants abound. Gay jungle prints are de rigueur, as are bold citrus shades. Jewelry is laden with riches from the sea. To go with the general toned-down spring-summer 1989 Italian look, heels are predominantly flat, hair styles neat and makeup natural. The simplicity of the clothes is dressed up by heavy gold and silver jewelry as well as the ethnic beads. Spring price tags have n't gone down, but efforts by the designers to contain the hike and a stronger dollar keep figures only slightly above last year's price list. By day, an Italian designer ready-to-wear outfit, made up of skirt blouse and jacket will cost an average of $ 2, OOO, while by night prices range from $ 3, OOO for the simpler gowns to above $ 10,000 for the more elaborate embroidered versions. Some tips of where to look for what in your local shops: Armani _ the softest daytime suits on the market in breezy silk tweeds, beautiful beaded jackets, and dreamy debutante gowns in wispy chiffon. Byblos _ the place to go for ethnic lore with tropical wraparound skirts, bandeau bras and calypso pants. <PERSON> Fendi </PERSON> _ perfection of the schoolgirl look with meticulously pleated linen suits by day embellished by night with lace collars and floral embroidery. <PERSON> Ferre </PERSON> _ the nautical expert of the season with his almost exclusive preference for navy blue, his new high-waisted sailor suit trousers, and the profuse use of nautical symbols on prints and jewelry. <ORGANIZATION> Krizia </ORGANIZATION> _ a young sporty look in daytime jackets and jumpers. Milan's prettiest evening gown in tea rose silk organza. Versace _ The best selection of high waisted pants and skirts. Nighttime's most seductive spring look in transparent chiffon blouses.

 <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s fashion style is the perfect match for a no-nonsense <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> patrician who favors the quiet elegance of a strand of pearls over eye-popping rhinestones and sequins. `` I'm not going to turn into a glamorous princess,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> remarked last summer. And after eight years of <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s high-gloss look, conservative <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> fashion designers are breathing a sigh of relief `` She brings a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> classic tradition to the White House instead of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> glitz,'' said <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Brenner </PERSON>, a vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Adele </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Simpson </ORGANIZATION>'s salon on Seventh Avenue, where Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has shopped for years. `` She likes simple, uncluttered clothes,'' <PERSON> Brenner </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` I think she's sensational. There's nothing phony about her. She's a very nice, down-to-earth lady who happens to be very bright. She always looks good.'' Canadian-born couturier <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Scaasi </PERSON>, who designed most of Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s wardrobe for inauguration week, says the new first lady dresses to please herself. `` I do n't think she's ever going to follow the fad,'' <PERSON> Scaasi </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` She's going to wear what looks well on her, what suits her.'' The designers say Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> prefers classical, traditional clothing _ shirtwaist dresses, three-piece suits and the like _ and likes all bright colors, especially blue. Her dresses cover the knee, no matter whether hemlines are rising or falling. Her trademark is a triple strand of pearls. `` They're fake, and she'll be the first to tell you that,'' said <PERSON> Brenner </PERSON>. `` I think she has very good taste,'' said <PERSON> Scaasi </PERSON>. `` She knows very much what she likes and what she does n't like. She feels good about herself. She's a very warm, very open and very intelligent woman with a great sense of humor. She approaches dressing that way, too.'' The first lady's press secretary, <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, said Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declined to discuss her fashion preferences with a reporter. `` She likes to look attractive, like most other women, but it's not a consuming passion in her life,'' Ms. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said `` She'd rather talk about other things. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Blass </PERSON>, another of the first lady's favorite designers, agrees. `` I do n't think clothes will be her preoccupation,'' he said recently. <PERSON> Blass </PERSON> designed the simple, teal-blue wool coat and collarless, cream-colored wool dress that Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wore to her husband's swearing-in as president. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, 63, wears a size 12 and laughingly calls herself `` a full-figured woman.'' She wears the lightest of makeup, eats heartily, laughs boisterously and enjoys a good joke, often at her own expense. `` What you see with me is what you get,'' she says. She recently told reporters that her style is getting some public applause. `` My mail tells me a lot of fat, white-haired, wrinkled ladies are tickled pink,'' she said. `` They're very sweet. I think it makes them feel better about themselves. I mean, look at me _ if I can be a success, so can they.'' She poked fun at her appearance again during a pre-inaugural `` Salute to the First Lady'' at the Kennedy Center. `` Speaking of glamor, I want you to look at me very carefully,'' she told her audience as she opened the jacket of her Scaasi-designed blue suit. `` Please notice the hair, the makeup, designer clothes,'' she said. `` I want you to watch me all week and remember _ you may never see it again.''

 <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> may be deliberately un-fashion conscious, but among women in her age group, that's fashionable. Fashion experts say that women in the 35-65 age range are independent in choosing their clothing, and they have a lot of economic clout to exercise that independence. Quality and classic styles are the common denominators in otherwise diverse choices. `` Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is n't necessarily a trend setter, but she is an example of what the trend is now,'' says <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, women's fashion director at the <ORGANIZATION> J.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penney </ORGANIZATION> department stores `` This kind of woman feels secure and self-confident. She knows she's arrived, professionally or otherwise. She's not struggling, not striving to impress people.'' <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Mackoff </PERSON>, a Seattle-based psychologist, agrees. Success in business and community life have relaxed the hold of the `` dress for success'' dictum. `` It was professional success, achievement and the security and confidence that follow'' that did it. `` Smart women have stopped trying to hide their own distinctive attributes.'' Their attitudes toward fashion are much like those of Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> says. `` The typical <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> woman is not hung up on fashion. What she wants is to look nice, to look pretty. And she wants to be comfortable with the way she looks.'' She says that these older women are among the biggest customers in the stores these days. And what they're buying reflects their concern with details, quality and classic styles that can be worn for years. `` We're experiencing a return to taste,'' she says. `` The majority are not looking for one-year fixes,'' she adds. The classics include suits, `` but not what I call the Wall Street banker suits of a few years ago. The new ones are beautifully cut, with details like buttons and linings of good quality.'' Other favorites are updated shirtwaist dresses, with attention to detail, cut and colors. They also like separates in street and sportswear that center around basic jackets. They like their jewelry to look like the real thing. `` What is real, or at least what looks real,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> says. `` The pieces are not necessarily smaller, but they are more refined.''

 That the small woman wants more than revised versions of her taller sister's clothes is attested by her open checkbook at cash registers. The petite lines, whether dresses, suits or sportswear, has outpaced all other categories of ready-to-wear in sales. Industry figures for a six-year period show a growth rate of almost twice for that for the overall misses and sportswear lines. Despite estimates that nearly 55 percent of all adult <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> women are 5-feet-3 or under, there was a time was the smaller woman was left with a choice of paying for alterations or just rolling up her sleeves. That has changed. Now, nearly all major apparel manufacturers have petite lines, and most large stores have departments or boutiques devoted to the small woman. Typically, petite-size styling differs from regular misses sizes in shorter sleeves, hems and waist lengths. Details are to scale, too. There will be one or two buttons on a suit jacket instead of two or three, and the shoulder pads will be lighter and less bulky. `` Little girl'' touches, such as ruffles, bows and puffy sleeves, are avoided. `` The petite woman is looking for excellent design and quality, and she wants it in the proportion and fit that is right for her,'' said <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Olsoff </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Frederick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a merchandising and marketing firm that has been tracking sales for about 30 department store chains. He said there has been a 143 percent compounded growth rate over six years for petite dresses and 350 percent for petite sportswear. This contrasts with 77 percent and 82 percent in those categories of misses sizes. `` When you're on the small side, you look for tailored, well-made fashions that do n't overwhelm you,'' said <PERSON> Gretchen </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, the current <LOCATION> Miss </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` I like clothing that fits well at the waist, such as shorter jackets and belted styles.''

 Here are some shopping pointers to keep in mind if you're 5-feet-4 or less and prefer not to dress like someone's little girl: Study your proportions If you have a long torso and short legs, choose long skirts and shoes with heels. If you have a short torso and long legs, then pick something like a long tunic to make the waist appear longer. The idea is to visually soften and blend the proportions. A key fitting point is at the shoulders. Collars and necklines should n't bunch up. Alterations are simpler for other parts of the garment if you start with a proportional shoulder fit. Choose softer versions of classically tailored suits. The details should be scaled down, with narrowed lapels and one-button closures. Jackets cut at hipbone length will look most natural with a smaller frame. Shoulder pads make the waist look smaller by extending the line of the shoulders, but make sure they're not too big and bulky. Horizontal lines will make you look chunky. So avoid square necklines or horizontal stripes or seams. By contrast, verticals _ V-necks, vertical stripes and seams _ will smooth and narrow your lines. Let color help, too. Monochromatic colors will help you maintain an unbroken visual line. You could match hosiery and pumps to solid colors in pants or skirts. Keep your accessories in proportion. Pass up wide belts and overlarge handbags -LRB- use your briefcase to transport extra items -RRB-. Shoes with medium heels will look best; avoid the extremes of stilletos or flats. Avoid fussy or cute touches, like <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Pan </PERSON> collars, puffed sleeves, big bows or ruffles, or extravagant costume jewelry. Stand up and be confident. Good posture and self-assurance has a lot to do with how well you look in your clothes. -LRB- The tips come from the Crafted with <ORGANIZATION> Pride </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which represents about 400 manufacturers. -RRB-

 The sun may be great for tomatoes, but it could be tough on your face. Even the most skilled makeup job ca n't rescue a complexion dulled and damaged by overexposure. Anyone who spends a good deal of time outdoors, whether in recreation or work, should be vigilant. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> says that no one is really free from risk. Most at risk are fair-skinned people who burn easily, but anyone can be affected. Especially during warm weather months, `` making under'' is as important as making up. For both beauty and safety, it will help you look cool, fashionable, and healthy. Making under can mean two things: Use protective sunscreens and lubricants before applying foundation, and apply your makeup with a light hand, choosing soft colors and textures. The type of sunscreen you use depends on your preference, but you may find a moisturizer-based cream most convenient in making up. Most of these products contain <LOCATION> PABA </LOCATION> -LRB- para-aminobenzoic acid -RRB- and are labeled with SPF -LRB- sun protection formula -RRB- ratings. Choose one that has a rating of 15 SPF or higher. Don ` t forget to use a sunscreen on your arms, legs, neck, or any other skin area bared during the summer, especially if you're outdoors between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. From a fashion point of view, the no-makeup look is the best makeup. This season's cosmetics lines feature light colors and textures designed to blend with the fluid, feminine clothing women are finding in stores. Matte foundations in sheer, delicate shades ranging from pink-tinged pastels to soft tawnies have been designed to play up rather than hide natural coloring. Unless your skin is very dry, finish the base with a light dusting of translucent powder. Choose similar light shades for eyes. Single eyeshadow colors can be found in muted heather and floral shades. Finish with a light brushing of blush colors in soft matte colors, coupled with frosted highlight shades blended at the tops of your cheekbones. Compacts with both base and highlight blushes can be found to make this combination easy. Even lip colors come muted and in matte finishes. Frosted, pearlized colors can be added for evening wear or can be used alone for a fresh natural effect during the day.

 Times _ and designs _ have changed since <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> warned that men seldom make passes at girls who wear glasses. The Optical Manufacturers Association says there were 63 million pair of eyeglasses sold in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1987. Nowadays, the hotter the sunglasses, the cooler the look. Clothes designer <PERSON> Giorgio </PERSON> <PERSON> Armani </PERSON>, for example, now markets some 40 models of men's and women's prescription eyewear and sunglasses, under the <PERSON> Giorgio </PERSON> <PERSON> Armani </PERSON> <PERSON> Occhiali </PERSON> label.

Though fashion and design are important, eye protection should also be considered when shopping for sunglasses, says the American <ORGANIZATION> Optometric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. When buying sunglasses, the association says, make sure they're impact-resistant, even `` industrial strength'' for the active wearer Dark lenses are recommended by the group, which says sunglasses should screen out 75 to 90 percent of the sunlight. If the eyes can be seen clearly through the lenses, they're probably not dark enough. The eyeglass frames should be large enough to keep sunlight from reaching the eyes, but the temple pieces should not block side vision, the association advises.

 It's no longer enough that jeans just fit _ and last. Manufacturers now promote jeans that have been acid-washed, white-washed, stone-washed, rinsed, bleached, or over-dyed. Last spring's favored look was acid-washed. This spring, says <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Schiefner </PERSON>, manager of product development for jeans manufacturer <PERSON> Levi </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, `` light-colored, lived-in denim'' will be popular. He says the style may also turn to narrower, slimmed-down styles, which translates as tighter-fitting.

 Like other active-sports gear, the body-hugging costumes worn by dancers, swimmers and bikers have been appropriated as fashionable streetwear for teens and near-teens. The old reasons for skintight outfits in sports and dance are free movement and to cut down wind or water resistance. A new reason might be that, coupled with brilliant colors, the new clothes flaunt a trim figure. Designer <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> August </PERSON> couples a short, loose graffiti T-shirt with second-skin bike pants, both done up with flashy neon colors. She also uses leotards, tank suits, crop tops, and stirrup tights in combinations of cotton blends, spandex, and shiny ribbed synthetics.

 Rock stars and fans need their designer lines just like any other upwardly mobile strivers. Somewhat ambiguously billed as `` designers of rock' n' roll street fashion,'' a firm called <ORGANIZATION> Lip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> now brings rock star fashion to off-the-rack customers. A favorite motif of designer-founder <PERSON> Drew </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> is the skull and dagger, which is featured on <ORGANIZATION> Lip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> T-shirts, jackets, leggings, and, yes, panties _ the kind worn on the outside for decoration. A bold `` War?'' poster-type print also shows up on jackets, and the collection also goes heavy on leather-look vinyls, lace-ups and zippers in odd locations on chaps, hot pants, bustiers, pegged jeans and any other items the rocker feels naked without. These are topped off with bangles, studs, insignias and other jewelry that might more accurately be described as hardware. <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>, 25, is a former musician who says his clothes appeal to rock band players and their fans. Sales in 1988 were around $ 1 million and marketed in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Outlets are boutiques, and prices range from $ 20 for a crop top to about $ 100 for a vinyl jacket. <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> says he started his company in 1985 in his parents' garage in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, having put his career as a rock musician behind him at the age of 22 He now employs 30 people.

 It is possible that the madras shirt or silk dress hanging in a department store window was designed by a three-dimensional graphics processor, reports a computer industry journal. Although 3-D computer workstations are usually used for molecular modeling, seismic analysis and other scientific projects, notes MIS week, several clothing manufacturers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> have adopted computer-aided workstations for their designers. The workstations permit designers to scan fabrics, patterns and models and then integrate the three in myriad combinations to eliminate much of the guesswork inherent in clothing design, the publication explains. It adds that additional software, in tandem with the workstation, permits the designer to manipulate existing fabrics, or simulate woven fabrics to create a new texture or pattern.

 In the past, pregnant women spent much of their time at home and maternity fashions carried little significance. Today, with more and more women in the workplace, designers go out of their way to produce chic and contemporary maternity clothes, says <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Loeb </PERSON>, director of design for Trio, manufacturers of maternity clothing. She offers this advice for mothers-to-be: _ Buy your regular size; maternity clothes are made to accommodate your changing body. Oversized regular clothing will hike up in front. But pants occasionally should be one or two sizes larger, to accommodate larger hips and thighs. _ Balance your wardrobe between career clothes and weekend wear. _ Reduce leg discomfort with support pantyhose. _ Wear a full or half slip to make clothes fall better and provide a smoother silhouette. _ Wear natural fibers, like cotton, wool and some rayons. _ Space your purchases; leave some of your budget for impulse buying, changing seasons and special events.

 The nation's largest banks raised their prime lending rates to 11 percent from 10.5 percent, the highest level since 1984, and economists predicted more increases will follow. Friday's rise was the first in 1989 for the rate, which banks use as a benchmark for setting interest on consumer and corporate loans, such as adjustable-rate mortgages. The last increase, from 10 percent to 10.5 percent, occurred Nov. 28. In 1984, the prime rate reached 10.75 percent.

<TEXT>
 When the temperature drops in this southwest <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> town, townsfolk see red. Red flannel, that is. This is the home of those 1880s-style, fire-engine-red long johns with the button drop seats, as well as red flannel granny gowns with matching dust caps and hardy red flannel lumberjack shirts. And residents are n't shy about their colorful claim to fame. Signs along the highway leading to this former logging town, population 2,615, proclaim <LOCATION> Cedar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> `` Red Flannel Capital of the World.'' Red plywood long johns hang from the lampposts on Main Street. There's the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flannel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flannel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Car </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wash </ORGANIZATION>, and at the neighborhood tavern, you can get a Red Flannel cocktail _ vodka and cranberry juice. Up until a few weeks ago, you could play a game of billiards there on a red flannel-topped pool table. In a warehouse a few blocks away, seamstresses piece together bolts of red flannel and the polyester-cotton knit blend of which the long johns are made. `` We think we're selling warmth across the board, not just the warmth of the garments, but the warmth of the company, of the town'' says <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flannel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Factory </ORGANIZATION>. Red flannel is to this town's heritage what automobiles are to <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. `` In school, the kids do cutouts of red flannels,'' said vice president <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Huckleberry </PERSON>, a Cedar Springs native. `` Almost everyone in town feels a part of The Red Flannel Factory.'' It began in 1936, when, during a brutal blizzard, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> feature writer wrote a piece complaining that there were no red flannels to be found. The Cedar Springs' newspaper responded with a tart editorial: `` Just because <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fifth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avenue </ORGANIZATION> or <PERSON> Bergdorf </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> do not carry red flannels, it does n't follow that no one in the country does. We've got red flannels in Cedar Springs!'' The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> ran the newspaper's reply on its wire, and in a few days, orders began pouring in from around the country to <LOCATION> Cedar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> merchants. Ironically, those merchants were getting their red flannels at the time from a <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> company. When the <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> manufacturer discontinued the items, a <LOCATION> Cedar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> housewife began making red flannels in her home. That was in 1949. Three years later, The Red Flannel Factory was established by <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, who converted a barn to meet the growing demand. When Wall retired in 1971, a group of about 10 area residents formed a corporation. In 1986, a Grand Rapids holding company led by <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> acquired a majority interest in the company with plans to expand it nationally on a wholesale basis. Since then, <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said, company sales have tripled and the number of employees has doubled. He wo n't reveal sales, but says the company brings in several million dollars a year. About 100 employees work for the company during peak production periods, usually between June and the day before Christmas. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> hopes there will be enough work soon to keep the plant running at capacity year-round. Long johns are the factory's biggest seller, with about 20,000 pairs sold each year. This year, the company is branching out with a line of children's active wear and will introduce a red-based plaid. Among other items produced are night shirts, robes, children's sleepers and pajamas, most of which are available in white, natural-fiber muslin as well as the famous scarlet Long johns retail from $ 19 for childrens' sizes to $ 39 for adults. Among the celebrities with the company's long johns in their closets are <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> and <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, <PERSON> Huckleberry </PERSON> says. While some large department stores carry the company's items, <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> is targeting country stores, lingerie shops, college bookstores and tourist spots in addition to the factory's mail-order business. The common thread woven through the town's fabric is celebrated each October with the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flannel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION>, complete with a Red Flannel Queen. The 50th annual event this year will make it among the oldest in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. Anyone failing to wear red during the festival is `` arrested'' by police and has to make a donation to charity to get out of jail. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON>, owner of <PERSON> Der </PERSON> <PERSON> Bier </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> tavern, does n't have to worry. He wears a pair of long johns to work every day. `` We had to get air conditioning in here just because of that,'' he said with a chuckle. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> hopes <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s election to the presidency of a `` kinder, gentler nation'' will help sales. `` It's like buying tradition _ a piece of Americana. It's like buying an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said, stopping to reflect on his last words. `` Maybe that's pushing it.''

<HEAD>Japan's Trade Surplus Widens In January</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s trade surplus rose in January over a year ago as low oil prices continued to keep down import costs, the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday. The surplus grew to $ 3.25 billion last month from $ 3.07 billion in January 1988, but was well below the monthly record of $ 9.65 billion set in December. January exports rose 11.5 percent from a year earlier to $ 19.32 billion and imports climbed 12.7 percent to $ 16.07 billion. The figures are compiled as the goods pass through customs. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s surplus with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, however, fell slightly over a year ago, to $ 2.974 billion from $ 2.976 billion. Exports to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market increased 11.1 percent to $ 6.50 billion, while imports from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> surged 22.4 percent to $ 3.52 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s overall surplus rose because of steady demand for Japanese goods in other countries enjoying continued economic expansion and because of lower prices for the crude oil <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> imports. They said imports of manufactured goods remain strong, a trend they expect to continue for some time. In trade with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> boosted car exports by 9.7 percent to $ 1.50 billion in January. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> steel sales in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> soared six-fold to $ 41.19 million and car sales nearly doubled to $ 41.62 million. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s exports to the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> rose 6.4 percent to $ 3.66 billion in January, while imports from the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> leaped 24.4 percent to $ 2.02 billion. That left <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> with a surplus of $ 1.64 billion, down from $ 1.82 billion in January 1988. Because of large oil imports, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> ran a $ 1.04 billion deficit in trade with the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, down from $ 1.30 billion in January 1988.

 The stock market declined broadly today in a carryover of selling from last week. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 7.86 to 2,278.21 in the first half hour of trading. Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 2 to 1 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 315 up, 744 down and 466 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 26.05 million shares as of 10 a.m. on Wall Street. Interest rates edged upward in the credit markets today amid expectations of action soon by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to tighten credit. Analysts said stock traders also came to work in an edgy mood following the market's decline Friday, which was the largest since Wall Street's winter-long rally began. Prices tumbled Friday after the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that producer prices of finished goods jumped 1 percent in January, exceeding analysts' projections. Then stocks had to absorb another jolt when banks across the country raised their prime lending rates from 10.5 percent to 11 percent.

 <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freightways </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday it will acquire <ORGANIZATION> Emery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in a cash deal valued at $ 230 million. <PERSON> Emery </PERSON>, one of the nation's largest air freight carriers, has accepted Consolidated's offer of $ 7.75 a share in cash for all outstanding common stock and $ 21.10 per share in cash for all outstanding preferred stock, the companies said. The agreement has been approved by the boards of directors of both companies, according to the announcement. <PERSON> Lary </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freightways </ORGANIZATION>, said the combined company will operate under the name `` <ORGANIZATION> Emery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worldwide </ORGANIZATION>, a CF Company.'' <PERSON> Emery </PERSON> has undergone a restructuring in recent years as competition from other overnight delivery services stiffened. The competitive climate is likely to heat up even more if the pending buyout of Tiger International by <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is completed. In the third quarter ended Sept. 30, the latest period for which the company has reported earnings, <ORGANIZATION> Emery </ORGANIZATION> lost $ 9.95 million, or 41 cents a share, on revenue of $ 313.8 million. In 1987, <PERSON> Emery </PERSON> bought <ORGANIZATION> Purolator </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Courier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> but its service levels remained disappointing as it integrated <ORGANIZATION> Purolator </ORGANIZATION>'s field operations into its own. Last year, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> businessman and former <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> executive <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> said that he was considering taking over the company, but no deal ever emerged. Emery Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Souders </PERSON> told the annual meeting in May that the company was `` positioning -LRB- itself -RRB- for the long haul.'' He said then that <PERSON> Emery </PERSON>'s goal was to become a `` strong, profitable, customer-driven company.'' <PERSON> Souders </PERSON> said the merger with Consolidated would `` offer customers the best service available.'' Consolidated Freightways does business in trucking and air freight delivery. Its 1988 revenue totaled $ 2.7 billion. The <LOCATION> Wilton </LOCATION>, Conn.-based Emery, which employs about 17,000 people, provides worldwide air courier and cargo service.

<HEAD>Rig Count Plunges By 34 to 746</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The number of working oil and gas rigs continued its recent decline, plunging by 34 to total 746 this week, <ORGANIZATION> Baker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday. This week's drop was largely caused by decreases in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, which lost 17 rigs, and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, which lost nine rigs. A year ago, the count totaled 968. Last week, the count dropped by 17 to total 780. Two weeks ago, the number of rigs rose by eight to total 797 while plummeting by 51 the week before. In the three weeks before that, the count declined twice by 32 and once by 36, all following a two-week increase of 25 rigs. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> economist <PERSON> Ike </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerridge </PERSON> said the count usually drops off during late December through late March or early April. The rig count is a widely watched industry index of drilling activity and it reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs actively producing oil. Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an oil toolmaker company that merged with <ORGANIZATION> Baker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, has kept track of the number of working rigs since 1940. In December 1981 at the height of the oil boom, the rig count reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $ 10 per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in the rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> began compiling figures. Among other major oil producing states, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> lost four rigs, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> lost two and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> were each down by one. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> each gained four rigs and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> got three more. <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> each got one more rig.

<HEAD>Grain and Soybeans Open Mostly Lower on Follow-Through Selling from
Last Week</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Grain and soybean futures prices opened lower this morning on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Traders said most of the pressure at the bell was the result of follow-through selling after Friday's sharply lower close in the bean pits, as well as showers over the weekend in the key <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> growing regions of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. New-crop beans, however, managed to avoid most of the downturn, in part because the government said late last week it would limit how much soybean planting will be allowed on set-aside land. On the opening, wheat was 2 cents to 3 cents lower, with the contract for delivery in March at $ 4.26 a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 2 cents lower, with March at $ 2.64 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 1 \ cents to 2 \ cents lower, with March at $ 2.04 -LCB- a bushel; and soybeans were \ cent to 5 -LCB- cents lower, with March at $ 7.29 Livestock futures were mostly higher, but pork futures mostly lower on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .25 cent lower to .45 higher, with February at 74.47 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .13 cent to .55 cent higher, with March at 82.70 cents a pound; live hogs were .20 cent lower to .17 cent higher, with February at 41.77 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were .27 cent to .60 cent lower, with February at 37.40 cents a pound.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> has told <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> officials to allow copies of the Feb. 27 Fortune magazine on the airline's fleet even though that issue carries a less-than-flattering profile of <LOCATION> Lorenzo </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> officials said today. The airline had ordered the biweekly business magazine pulled from its fleet of more than 200 aircraft because it contains a cover story calling <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s parent company, one of `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Toughest Bosses.'' `` Lorenzo personally instructed that Fortune be put back on the planes,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON>. `` He knew nothing about the original decision to remove it. He said we had no business taking it off in the first place. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> is saying we're not in the business of censorship.'' The earlier order had come from middle managers in <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s aircraft services support department, <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said In a brief directive to aircraft service managers around the country, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> had said: `` It's imperative that the current issue of Fortune magazine be removed immediately from all <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> aircraft. `` Dispose of all copies locally,'' said the directive. `` Have a member of management audit all aircraft to ensure compliance. Report accomplishment by tail number to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>'s picture appears on the issue's cover. A caption states that <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> `` likes managers to work 14 hours a day, six days a week.'' The brief profile calls <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> a `` loose cannon'' and quotes past and present executives of Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> as saying <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> is a highly impulsive manager. `` He is a visionary, a dealmaker, a union buster and a showboater,'' says the profile, part of a larger article on other `` tough'' corporate chieftans. The story also talks of intrigue and backbiting among <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>'s executives Art Kent, a <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, concurred that <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> did not issue the directive. `` If <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> had made such an order, I would know about it and he has not,'' <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> said Sunday. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> does n't normally stock the magazine on its flights, he said. <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, which faces a March 4 strike threat by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION>, had nothing to gain by leaving the magazine on its planes. `` The profile of -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>'s -RRB- chairman was unflattering and would be viewed in that vein by our passengers,'' <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> earlier. `` Considering the current environment, we decided to remove the issue.''

<HEAD>Interest Rate Shopping Pays _ Over and Over</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The same people who eagerly seek rebates of a few hundred dollars on new-car purchases or wait in line at appliance store sales could be tossing away tens of thousands of dollars on their <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> accounts. It is being done every day, casually and indifferently, by thousands of individuals who -LRB- 1 -RRB- fail to shop for the best rates, which now vary widely, and -LRB- 2 -RRB- fail to comprehend the impact of compounding over extended time periods. Adding to the waste and confusion is institutional ignorance of their own products, according to <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mintz </PERSON>, an analyst and critic of insurance and financial practices. In a check of 13 institutions in the first week of February, he found only a couple that could even estimate the total a certain deposit amount would become over a specific time period. Three branches of the same bank gave different figures. After 34 years of dealing with the sale of insurance, annuities, certificates of deposit, <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>, retirement plans and the like, the soft-spoken, intense, <PERSON> Mintz </PERSON> believes consumers need factual point-of-sale information. In pursuit of his goal, he has testified before committees of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, offered his somewhat testy and often unwelcome views at insurance industry meetings and aided government agencies in studies of IRAs and insurance. He publishes the NROCA -LRB- `` acorn'' backwards -RRB- Newsletter _ Department C, <ORGANIZATION> NROCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, Box 12066, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> 75225. It seeks to give `` one or two ideas a year to retirees and preretirees that will be worth hundreds if not multi-thousands of dollars.'' <ORGANIZATION> NROCA </ORGANIZATION>'s most recent offering, at $ 8.75 a copy, is a `` Consumer's Guide to Compound Interest,'' providing 1,600 yields arranged to allow even financially unsophisticated individuals to analyze IRAs, insurance, CDs, and savings Though a thorn to financial and insurance institutions, <PERSON> Mintz </PERSON> remains in the mainstream, if barely. His views are heard if not welcomed. He authored a study course presented by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> of CPAs. He is on the editorial board of a professional, financially-oriented national magazine. Working with telephone and computer from his home, <PERSON> Mintz </PERSON> found published certificate of deposit yields ranging from 8.33 percent to 9.8 percent at institutions throughout the country during the first week of February. That difference in yields could mean that a $ 10,000 investment after 30 years might be worth $ 110,271 _ or $ 165,223. It would mean that a $ 2,000 deposit each year for 30 years could be worth $ 260,800 _ or $ 347,826. To his dismay, he found that while financial institutions quote precise interest rates, almost none can state accurately how much a deposit will total over a specific time period. That is, what the annual yield would be. Interest rates and yields differ, mainly because of compounding, which can be daily, monthly, quarterly, semiannually or annually. The differences seem small, but time magnifies them. Compounding, therefore, can be magic or tragic _ magic if you utilize it, tragic if you do n't. At an interest rate of 10 percent compounded annually, for example, $ 10,000 becomes $ 67,275 in 20 years. If compounded daily, the 10 percent rate totals $ 75,962, a yield of 10.67 percent a year. <PERSON> Mintz </PERSON> bases his conclusion _ that institutions can not calculate yields _ on the responses to his request for information on the placement with them of $ 87,000 in a rollover <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> for three or five years. His question: `` How much in cash can I withdraw without penalty at the end of the period? Also, give me the rate and yield.'' It was then, he says, that three branches of one bank gave answers ranging from $ 118,000 to $ 133,000 for the five-year period. And a bank that advertised quarterly compounding, he says, based calculations on 360 rather than 365 days. End Adv PMs Tues., Feb. 14.

 Stock prices closed sharply lower but above their worst levels Monday amid renewed concern that British interest rates could remain high for an extended period. Dealers said trading was cautious following comments by Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> over the weekend that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s January inflation rate would show a `` particularly marked rise.'' The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was down 23.4 points, or 1.1 percent, at 2,032.7. The index was down a minimum 18.8 points in early business, but then moved as much as 35.2 points lower in early afternoon. Volume was light, as 474.5 million shares changed hands, down substantially from Friday's 671.4 million shares and sharply lower than the brisk pace of dealing seen in recent weeks. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s inflation figures are due on Friday. <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> seemed to be preparing markets for bad news with a warning that the annual inflation rate would top 7 percent in January. That would compare with an annual rise in December of 6.8 percent.

The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 36.97 points on Friday, edged up .54 to 2,286.61 by 2 p.m. today on Wall Street.

<HEAD>Study: Mexico Lost Half Its Foreign Reserves in 1988</HEAD>

 <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s foreign reserves plummeted by 50 percent to around $ 8 billion last year, one of the most severe costs of an otherwise successful anti-inflation program, according to a private think tank. Investor disbelief that the government would maintain the program's freeze on the peso-dollar exchange rate was a leading cause of capital flight, the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sector </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> said in a review of the Mexican anti-inflation program. Investors fearing a sudden peso devaluation made advance purchases of capital goods from abroad, sustaining economic activity and increasing imports of items such as machinery despite the government's efforts to slow it, the report said. However, some $ 700 million in capital returned to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in January, even after the government instituted a gradual peso devaluation, the central bank announced last week. The Center's report, based on government and central bank data, was released over the weekend. The government did surpass its chief economic policy goal last year by halving an inflation rate that reached a record 159.2 percent in 1987. Consumer prices rose by 51.7 percent in 1988 under the program that froze the dollar-peso exchange rate, the minimum wage and prices for government-regulated goods and services. But despite its initial success in curbing inflation, the government failed to overcome `` general skepticism towards the program's viability,'' said the Center's report. The result was `` a wave of speculation'' by nervous investors that prompted capital flight, it said. Pre-payments of private sector foreign debts and depressed export revenues from oil also contributed to the run on reserves, it said. In addition, the program's wage and price freezes cut workers' real purchasing power by 15 percent last year and created price distortions for regulated goods and services, the Center said Shortages developed for some basics, including meats, milk and certain vegetables, as producers withheld their product from the market to protest official prices they considered too low. The plunge in reserves prompted President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> to adopt the gradual currency devaluation Jan. 1 that is averaging one peso per day. The private sector financed imports through non-oil export revenue and with credits from outside the nationalized banking system. Representing 90 percent of total Mexican imports, capital goods imports between January and October 1988 surged by 55.4 percent over the same period in 1987. Consequently, the economy actually registered 0.5 percent growth in 1988, although `` the hoped-for recession ... only began to develop towards the end of the year,'' the report said.

 Grain and soybean futures prices slipped lower across the board Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Traders said the beans came under pressure at the opening bell because of follow-through selling after Friday's sharply lower close and considerable rain over the weekend in the key <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> growing regions of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. New-crop beans, however, slipped only half as much, in part because the government said late last week it would limit how much soybean planting will be allowed on set-aside land.

 Palo Verde Unit 3 generated more electricty last year than any nuclear plant in the world, operators said Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION> said statistics from Nucleonics Week, a publication of the nuclear industry, show that the newest of three units at the generating station 50 miles west of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> produced 10.87 million megawatt hours last year _ enough for two cities the size of <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>. The output of the plant's other two reactors lagged, however. According to <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> figures, Unit 1 has operated at 51 percent of capacity since its startup in late 1985, and Unit 2 has run at 67.3 percent. Unit 3, which was started in late 1987 and entered commercial operation early in 1988, has operated at nearly 90 percent of capacity and last summer set a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> record of 214 days of continuous operation after startup. It also set a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> record for a month, with 955,400 megawatts in March.

<HEAD>School Endowment Performance Hurt by Stock Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 College and university endowments earned some money on their investments for fiscal 1988 but the performance was hurt by the stock market crash, a study reported Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Officers </ORGANIZATION> said that the average rate of return for the period July 1, 1987 to June 30, 1988 was 1.3 percent. That was down from 13.9 percent in fiscal 1987. `` Considering the year on the stock market, we were pleased that they had a positive rate of return,'' said association spokeswoman <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> <PERSON> Howton </PERSON>. She said the endowments held their own for a number of reasons. `` The best stocks did rebound after the crash,'' she said. `` And not all institutions are totally invested into stocks. Bonds and CDs did well.'' The endowment study of 315 schools, conducted annually since 1974, showed total market value for participating funds at $ 49.5 billion in fiscal 1988, up from $ 47.9 billion the previous year. The 10 participating institutions with the highest endowment fund assets were the same 10 as the year before, in the same order. <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> topped the list with an endowment of nearly $ 4.2 billion, as of mid-1988. The <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> system was second with $ 2.8 billion, followed by <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> at $ 2.3 billion and <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> at $ 2.1 billion.

<TEXT>
 More than a dozen years after rising from the ashes of six bankrupt Northeast railroads, <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> must replace its top executive at a time when it had just made a transition aimed at continuity. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanborn </PERSON>, 52, died Sunday of an apparent heart attack, just six weeks after becoming chairman and chief executive officer of the Philadelphia-based freight carrier. Speculation by some analysts focused Monday on <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, senior vice president for finance, and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, senior vice president for marketing and sales, as two candidates to take <PERSON> Sanborn </PERSON>'s place. Others suggested <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Crane </PERSON>, 73, who retired as chairman and CEO on Jan. 1, could return for an interim period while a search was made for someone from outside the company. <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> said it would make no announcement before a board of directors meeting Wednesday. <PERSON> Sanborn </PERSON>, a 27-year railroad veteran, joined <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> last March as president and chief operating officer. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said he considered it likely that <PERSON> Crane </PERSON> would be asked to return on a temporary basis. <PERSON> Crane </PERSON>, who led the company for eight years, is credited with setting the direction that made <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> profitable and enabled it to be returned to the private sector through a public stock offering in March 1987. Despite <PERSON> Sanborn </PERSON>'s death, analysts said the railroad's future appears bright. `` There is no single person who is indispensible to a company,'' said an analyst who asked not to be identified. `` This is not a major disaster for <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION>, though it's certainly tough in the short run.'' <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> was formed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1976 to reorganize six bankrupt Northeast railroads, the <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lackawanna </LOCATION>, Reading, Central of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lehigh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Lehigh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. After 11 years of government ownership, <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> was sold March 26, 1987, for $ 1.6 billion in the largest public stock offering in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history. <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> has been trying to build its traffic in such areas as automobile shipping after concentrating on rebuilding track, gaining clearance for double-stacked container cars and other equipment needs. Under <PERSON> Sanborn </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> had been expected to try to expand into such areas as hauling waste and already is carrying compacted refuse from northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> area to eastern <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>.

 American consumers accustomed to finding `` Made in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'' stamped on cameras and radios increasingly can find those words on packages of a more intimate product: condoms. <ORGANIZATION> Okamoto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s leading condom maker with a 63 percent market share, last year launched a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> subsidiary and plans to have its product on store shelves in the Northeast in a couple of months. Other Japanese companies also have entered the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market in recent years. While some industry analysts say high consumer brand loyalty makes it difficult for the Japanese to grab market share, <PERSON> Hisayuki </PERSON> <PERSON> Naito </PERSON>, general manager of <ORGANIZATION> Okamoto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, predicts <PERSON> Okamoto </PERSON> will capture 10 percent of the American condom market in two years and up to 25 percent within seven. `` The Japanese philosphy is that once we have committed ourselves, we will do it,'' said <PERSON> Naito </PERSON>, who sees a vast untapped market in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> because of health concerns about AIDS and the birth control pill. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retail condom sales increased 62 percent to $ 292 million between 1985 and 1987, according to <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. But only 16 percent of Americans use condoms as the primary form of birth control compared with 76 percent in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, where the birth control pill is illegal, analysts say. `` In this country, the condom is a very hidden product,'' <PERSON> Naito </PERSON> said during a recent interview. A display rack with packages of <PERSON> Okamoto </PERSON>'s American competitors decorates one wall of a conference room at the company headquarters. `` This is more healthy, no question about it,'' <PERSON> Naiko </PERSON> said, unfurling a pink Crown condom, one of four Okamoto brands to be marketed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The company plans a $ 2 million ad campaign stressing the quality of its condoms, including print ads in <LOCATION> Vogue </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> and The Advocate, a magazine aimed at gays. One ad features a photo of a condom stretched by two fingers _ a frankness that <PERSON> Okamoto </PERSON> hopes will help Americans overcome their shyness about the product, <PERSON> Naito </PERSON> said. The other <PERSON> Okamoto </PERSON> lines are <PERSON> Harmony </PERSON>, Regal and Beyond, which is packaged in a plastic compact case and is aimed at women, who account for 25 to 40 percent of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> condom purchasers. <PERSON> Okamoto </PERSON> is an $ 800 million-a-year company that also sells tires, distributes <ORGANIZATION> Reebok </ORGANIZATION>, Keds and <LOCATION> Rockport </LOCATION> shoes in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and makes the plastic interiors for <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> cars. Condoms, which <PERSON> Okamoto </PERSON> also sells in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, account for about 10 percent of the company's business. <PERSON> Okamoto </PERSON> has six employees in <LOCATION> Stratford </LOCATION> and marketing deals with eight independent wholesalers. It will continue shipping condoms from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> but may eventually build a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plant, <PERSON> Naito </PERSON> said. Other Japanese companies long have been trying to crack the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market. <ORGANIZATION> Fugi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the No. 2 Japanese condom maker, and <ORGANIZATION> Nisshoiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, a Japanese trading company, own 60 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Safetex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Lyndhurst </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> under a joint venture begun in 1987. <PERSON> Fuji </PERSON> has made condoms in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since buying the <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> plant of <ORGANIZATION> Circle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> about 15 years ago, which it since has closed. <ORGANIZATION> Sagami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s Kimono condom has been imported by <ORGANIZATION> Mayer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, since April 1987. Industry analysts warn that the Japanese may have difficulty in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> condom market because Americans remain somewhat embarrassed by the subject. They therefore are likely to stay with brands they recognize and can grab quickly from store shelves. New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Carter-Wallace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, maker of the Trojans brand of condoms, now controls about 53 percent of the market. <ORGANIZATION> Schmid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, controls about 27 percent of the market with such brands as <PERSON> Ramses </PERSON>, Sheik and Excita. <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> predicts condom sales will continue growing at 15 percent annually in the foreseeable future. But some observers predict growth will slow with the calming of fears about heterosexual transmission of AIDS.

<HEAD>EEC Members Disagree On Uniform Tax On Interest Income</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> countries disagreed Monday on a proposed witholding tax of 15 percent on interest income from bonds and bank savings and sent the plan to a high-level study group. At a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> economics and finance ministers, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> completely opposed the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>'s proposal while <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> sought a reduction in toward the level of its own tax of 10 percent. Of the other member states, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> broadly supported the proposal. The proposal was made last week by the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in an effort to harmonize the widely different taxes on interest income in the 12 member States _ from zero in <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> to 35 percent in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. Because <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> laws on taxation need to be approved unanimously, diplomats said that it was difficult to see how the proposals could be adopted unless radical changes were made. <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>'s Finance Minister <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Poos </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> would block the commission's plan. <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>, which has banking secrecy laws and is considered the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s tax haven, fears its economy will suffer if a tax is imposed. The high-level study group is expected to complete its report in four to six weeks. The ministers will discuss its conclusions at their regular monthly meeting in April. The group is composed of the chief tax authorities of the twelve <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> member states.

 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acceptance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Monday announced a 9.5 percent increase in its fourth-quarter profits, while <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> reported a 16.5 percent profit rise and <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> had a 0.8 percent earnings drop during the period. The three subsidiaries of the nation's biggest carmaker reported their earnings in advance of the parent company, which was expected to announce overall results Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> GMAC </ORGANIZATION>, the company's financing and mortgage operation, posted a profit of $ 257.4 million in the final three months of 1988. That compared with net income of $ 235 million in the same period of 1987. Revenue during the quarter fell to $ 3.36 billion from $ 3.44 billion a year earlier. Fourth quarter 1987 earnings were considered unusually low because of a surge in refinancing mortgages that <ORGANIZATION> GMAC </ORGANIZATION> assumed with the purchase of two mortgage companies in 1985, the company said. <ORGANIZATION> GMAC </ORGANIZATION>'s 1988 profit fell 18.3 percent to $ 1.19 billion from $ 1.45 billion. Annual revenue rose to $ 13.5 billion from $ 13.4 billion in 1987. EDS said it earned $ 103.4 million, or 85 cents a share, in the fourth quarter of last year, compared with $ 104.2 million, or 85 cents a share, during the same period in 1987. Revenue rose to $ 1.3 billion from $ 1.19 billion a year earlier. For the year, <ORGANIZATION> EDS </ORGANIZATION> had a profit of $ 384.1 million, or $ 3.15 a share, up from $ 323.1 million, or $ 2.65 a share, during 1987. The company said it expanded its business base in 1988 in the commercial, international, governmental, financial and insurance markets as well as signing a five-year agreement with <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>. Annual revenue rose to $ 4.84 billion from $ 4.43 billion in 1987. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> said its fourth-quarter 1988 earnings rose to $ 169.5 million, or 43 cents a share, from $ 145.5 million, or 36 cents a share, during the same quarter in 1987. Revenue during fourth quarter 1988 was $ 3.1 billion, up from $ 2.7 billion a year earlier. For the entire year, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 653.3 million, or $ 2.01 a share, up 25.3 percent from $ 521.1 million, or $ 1.67 per share, in 1987 profits. Annual revenues rose to $ 11.2 billion last year from $ 10.5 billion in 1987. The earnings include the impact of a first quarter accounting change, which boosted net income by $ 18.7 million. EDS earnings are the base for <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Class </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> E </ORGANIZATION> stock and <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> profits are linked to <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s Class H stock. Last week, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> announced a 20 percent increase in its dividend and a 2-for-1 split of its common stocks. Dividends rose 41 percent for <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s Class E stock and 64 percent for <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> Class H stock. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings are expected to be announced Thursday. On Feb. 2, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> posted a fourth quarter profit of $ 433.6 million, or $ 1.85 per share, and annual earnings of $ 1.05 billion, or $ 4.66 a share, down 18.6 percent from 1987. The Big Three automakers are expected to earn a total of about $ 11 billion in 1988, breaking the companies' combined 1984 earnings record of $ 9.79 billion.

<HEAD>Four Arrested On Bribe Charges In Stock Scandal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Prosecutors on Monday made the first arrests directly involving the stock transactions that have scandalized the government of Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>. Japanese waited to see what prosecutors would do next, since dozens of politicians, businessmen and journalists were among those who bought bargain-priced stock unavailable to the public, and then profited handsomely when public sales began and prices soared. Among the four arrested was <PERSON> Hiromasa </PERSON> <PERSON> Ezoe </PERSON>, founder and former chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the information conglomerate at the center of the scandal. <PERSON> Ezoe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hiroshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kobayashi </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION>, a Recruit subsidiary that financed the stock sales, were held on suspicion of offering bribes in return for favors related to Recruit's business activities. Also arrested were <PERSON> Ei </PERSON> <PERSON> Shikiba </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hisahiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasegawa </PERSON>, former directors of <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest company, for altegedly receiving bribes from Recruit in tnyPCorm of bargain shares. Both have said they did not provide any favors for Recruit. Recruit and <ORGANIZATION> NTT </ORGANIZATION> said in Statements that they regretted the prosecutors' actions. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> told reporters Monday he hoped for a full investigation into the scandal, but refused to comment further. A <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> aide and relative have been linked to the stock purchases. The <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> credited public disgust with the scandal for its victory in a special parliamentary election Sunday, and it demanded that <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> resign or call new general elections. Replying in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> dismissed the demands. He said he `` humbly accepted'' the election results and that his governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> will work for reforms to restore public trust in politics. In making the arrests, prosecutors said the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled in July that the sale of stock whose price was sure to rise and which could not be easily purchased by the general public amounted to bribery. Japanese law provides for up to five years in prison for receivers of bribes, and up to three years for those who offer bribes. The scandal surfaced last summer, raising questions of ethics and money links between business and politicians. The only previous arrest had been of a Recruit official accused of trying to bribe an opposition member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> to soft-pedal an investigation into the affair. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> formed a new Cabinet last December to put the scandal behind him, but two ministers soon were forced to resign after it was disclosed they had continued receiving political donations from Recruit. In all, three Cabinet ministers and more than a dozen politicians and businessmen have resigned because of the scandal. In Sunday's special election, the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> won the upper house seat of a Liberal Democrat who died in December. The election in <LOCATION> Fukuoka </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was the first for a national office since the scandal surfaced. <PERSON> Takako </PERSON> <PERSON> Doi </PERSON>, the Socialists' chairwoman, said in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> Monday that <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> should resign. `` Either the entire Cabinet must resign, or the prime minister must dissolve <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> so the people can express their will,'' Ms. <PERSON> Doi </PERSON> said. A dissolution of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> would force elections in the powerful lower house, where the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> have more than 300 of the 512 seats. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> told Japanese reporters the special election was a `` complete defeat. I never anticipated it.'' `` I will stake everything on political reform,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on Monday. An election is scheduled in July for half the seats in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s upper house. A severe setback then could threaten <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s chances to win another two-year term as party leader and prime minister in October. The <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s leading index fell Monday for the first time in eight sessions. Market analysts blamed the governing party's defeat in the special election and eroding confidence in the <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> administration.

An official for one of the investment banking firms handling the sale said Monday that preliminary bids for <ORGANIZATION> GP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> were due Tuesday, although announcement of a winner was n't expected until spring.

<TEXT>
 Energy futures prices rose sharply in moderate trading Monday, surprising analysts who said there was little news to stir the market. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the March contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, settled 48 cents higher at $ 17.59 a barrel. Last week, the contract fluctuated before closing the week at $ 17.11. Other contract months also rose. Among refined products on the exchange, the March contract for unleaded gasoline rose 0.58 cent to 48.15 cents a gallon, while domestic heating oil scheduled for delivery next month closed up 0.81 cent at 48.17 cents a gallon. Other contract months also gained. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haskins </PERSON>, assistant vice president of institutional energy futures for <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the rally came as a surprise. `` It baffled most traders, to be honest with you,'' she said. `` In fact, the market fundamentals were mildly bearish.'' The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, for example, lowered its estimate of demand growth for 1989, Ms. <PERSON> Haskins </PERSON> said. Earlier projections of strong demand growth had helped push the market up in recent weeks. Other talk in the market focused on news that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, one of 13 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION>, plans to increase its production capacity to 4 million barrels a day this year, from about 3.5 million. However, Oil Minister <PERSON> Gholamreza </PERSON> <PERSON> Aqazadeh </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would adhere to its quota even with higher capacity. <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreis </PERSON>, energy broker with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION>, attributed Monday's gains to technical factors after a week of fluctuating prices. `` There were more people coming in and that made the market more susceptible to a rally,'' he said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Champion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a maker of athletic and leisure clothing, successfully fought off a hostile takeover and agreed Monday to be sold to <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> Corp. of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> for $ 320.9 million. The announcement that the food and apparel giant would buy Champion for $ 77 a share followed Champion's request for bids to fend off a takeover by a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment group. `` Our shareholders are receiving full value and this transaction is the best possible outcome for our employees, customers and the communities in which we operate,'' Champion President <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> said. Champion, well-known in college bookstores around the country for sweatshirts and T-shirts, had been a takeover target of the investment group <ORGANIZATION> Walsh </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greenwood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Acting through <ORGANIZATION> Phonicam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a company created to attempt the takeover, the investment group had offered $ 51 a share, $ 55 a share and last month upped its offer to $ 61 a share `` I think the $ 61 figure was getting into an area that shareholders may have started thinking they were getting fair value, and that's why management went looking for buyers,'' said <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Rayomnd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, Fla.-based borkerage firm. <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> officials said they would begin a tender offer this week for the 4.16 million outstanding shares of fully diluted Champion stock and various convertible stock options. Champion stock climbed $ 12.125 to close at $ 75.75 in <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading Monday. After the deal was announced, a spokesman for <PERSON> Phonicam </PERSON> said the company could n't justify spending that much money for Champion. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said she thought the sale to <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> might help Champion continue its fast-paced growth because the company might receive more capital investment from its new parent. Champion has enjoyed 14 straight quarters of increased sales and profits, and last year boosted earnings 114 percent to $ 14.89 million, or $ 4.34 a share, on sales of $ 219 million. Although the company is best known for uniforms and athletic clothes, much of Champion's recent growth has come by adding leisure wear and branching out into department and specialty stores. <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, one of the nation's 50 largest companies, sells packaged food and various consumer products and operates a food service business. The company reported $ 10.4 billion in sales in its last fiscal year. `` One of our missions is to grow all of our businesses, and strategic acquisition is one way of doing that,'' <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Culp </PERSON> said. `` This was just one of those good opportunities that come along.'' <PERSON> Culp </PERSON> said the company had not been interested in buying Champion until it was asked to make a bid for the suburban Rochester-based firm. Champion will join <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s other apparel companies, including Hanes underwear, L'eggs hosiery, Isotoner gloves and <LOCATION> Bali </LOCATION> bras.

 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it will shift production of three light-duty trucks to a <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> plant from <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> in 1991. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Klipstine </PERSON> also said the automaker would put production of at least one new truck line in its <LOCATION> Flint </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, plant, which has about 3,800 workers to compensate for the switch to a plant in <LOCATION> Janesville </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> said production of its Chevrolet Suburban and Blazer trucks and the <ORGANIZATION> GMC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jimmy </ORGANIZATION> utility vehicles would be moved from <LOCATION> Flint </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Janesville </LOCATION> in 1991 for the 1992 model year. Gov. <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> announced the move in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Janesville </LOCATION> plant, which employs about 5,700 people, currently produces the <ORGANIZATION> Buick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Skylark </ORGANIZATION> and the Chevrolet Cavalier compact models. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> said those lines would be phased out to make room for the new truck lines. <PERSON> Klipstine </PERSON> said decisions on employment, production speeds and the length of retooling time for both plants is unknown. It is likely that both plants will be shut down to refit machines to make the new products. He said he did not know what <LOCATION> Flint </LOCATION>'s new truck would be or when it would be announced. `` Those are the kinds of things we wo n't know until we learn what kind of product line is coming into <LOCATION> Flint </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` We're talking about something that's going to happen in 1991. The Flint plant now produces 32 vehicles an hour and made about 136,000 vehicles in 1988. In April, it will begin production of crew cab and cab chassis light-duty truck models now being made in <LOCATION> Janesville </LOCATION>.

 Barbie and G.I. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> had birthday parties this week. Mr. Game Show could n't make it. `` He died,'' said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirchberger </PERSON>, a toy company analyst. Weep not, though, for Mr. <PERSON> Show </PERSON>. Of the estimated 5,000 games and toys being introduced at the toy industry's annual coming-out party in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> this week, the vast majority will join him in that big toybox in the sky. `` You'll see a lot of products at the Toy Fair this week that you wo n't see next year,'' said <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON>, another industry analyst. `` Most toys do not make it into a second season.'' One reason: `` There's lots of junk.'' But quality is n't the only criterion; some entries are undone only by outrageous circumstance. `` The Evel Knievel doll did very well when it came out. Then it just fell apart,'' said <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. He guessed that <PERSON> Knievel </PERSON>'s 1977 guilty plea in a baseball-bat assault did n't help the toy. Plain poor judgment kills other entries. Consider the ill-starred Golden Girl and the Guardian of the Gemstones. `` One of the biggest stiffs in the history of the business,'' its manufacturer, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Galoob </PERSON>, said Monday. `` The concept was action figures for little girls,'' said <PERSON> Galoob </PERSON>, chief of <ORGANIZATION> Lewis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Galoob </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` There were 12 beautiful female warriors with shields and swords. The trade bought in very, very heavily. `` And what we discovered was that little girls did n't want to play with warrior figurines.'' Other casualties of the toy wars are harder to explain. Barbie turns 30 years old this week, dancing on the grave of a pretender named Gem. While G.I. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> marches on at 25, the Inhumanoids _ a toady group from the center of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> _ withered in the light of day. Why? Nobody knows. `` That is the $ 64 million question in the toy industry. And in most other industries,'' said <PERSON> Kirchberger </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> Paine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Webber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` Nobody sets out to make a bad movie. It just happens. It's the same thing with toys. Manufacturers are willing to enter the fray in hopes of capturing a chunk of the $ 12.8 billion annual toy business. They trim losses by making models of most new toys, holding back on full-scale production until orders come in. Still, there have been some epic bombs. <ORGANIZATION> View-Master </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ideal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is still scratching its head over <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s Zoo, a menagerie of stuffed animals inspired by the rock star's predilection for offbeat pets `` He even went on tour with his chimp. So we tried,'' said View-Master's <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>. `` We had the chimp appearing in stores in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. We had quite a few good promotions, but we just could n't move the product.'' Then there was Mr. Game Show, a big hit at last year's Toy Fair, a goner now. <PERSON> Kirchberger </PERSON> gave the eulogy: `` It was modeled after a TV game show; there was a figure of a host, he spoke, he'd ask you questions, you'd push buttons to indicate your answer, he'd tell you if you were right or wrong and how much you won. `` Very clever. Wrong price point, wrong I-don ` Mr. Game Show did n't make it.''

 The dollar finished lower against most major currencies Monday in thin trading as players awaited the next round of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic reports. Gold prices also declined. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said gold bullion was bid at $ 385.20 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, down from $ 387 late Friday. The dollar advanced in the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and continued rising later in European trading, buoyed by expectations of higher <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates. The dollar later retreated in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Dealers said last Friday's report of a greater-than-expected 1 percent rise in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wholesale prices in January had rekindled speculation that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> would hike its discount rate soon in an effort to help curb inflation by slowing the economy. But the absence of a rate boost took away the market's excuse to drive the dollar still higher, traders said. The discount rate is the interest the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> charges on loans to financial institutions. `` We did n't see a lot of business moving through today,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>, vice president of corporate currency trading at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office of <ORGANIZATION> Barclays </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. `` It's a case of a market that's waiting for additional economic data before it moves.'' Market participants are awaiting the publication of Tuesday's report on retail sales for January, Wednesday's report on business inventories and factory use for December, Thursday's report on January housing starts and Friday's report on the December merchandise trade deficit In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar rose 0.65 Japanese yen to a closing 128.30 yen. Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar was quoted at 128.60 yen and by the end of trading in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the dollar was quoted at 128.07 yen, down from 128.68 yen late Friday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound fell to $ 1.7495 from $ 1.7547 on Friday. Later in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, sterling advanced to $ 1.7525 from $ 1.7467 late Friday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Friday's rates, included: 1.8677 West German marks, down from 1.8695; 1.5877 Swiss francs, down from 1.5885; 6.3575 French francs, down from 6.3588; 1,359.00 Italian lire, down from 1,363.50; and 1.1860 Canadian dollars, unchanged Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Friday's rates, included: 1.8705 West German marks, up from 1.8595; 1.5895 Swiss francs, up from 1.5778; 6.3650 French francs, up from 6.3200; 2.1120 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0960; 1,362.50 Italian lire, up from 1,353.75; and 1.1868 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1857 Gold fell in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid of $ 384.25 a troy ounce from $ 391 bid late Friday. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the late bid for gold was $ 383.75, down from $ 389.50 bid late Friday. Earlier in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold fell $ 6.80 an ounce to close at a bid of $ 387.05.

 Copper futures prices dropped steeply on Monday, punctuating a weeks-long decline following reports that an increase in inventories at the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> was two or three times larger than traders had anticipated. On other markets, crude oil futures climbed higher despite rumblings of increased production by both <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>; grain and soybean futures prices slipped lower after favorable weather swept the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> growing regions of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> over the weekend; and gold dipped slightly as traders anticipated the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> might nudge interest rates higher to fight inflation. On Monday, copper futures settled 1.6 cents to 5.45 cents lower on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with the contract for delivery in March at $ 1.2825 a pound. The spot March contract for copper futures peaked at $ 1.5190 a pound nearly four weeks ago and has declined steadily since as supply tightness has eased and labor problems in the key producing nations of <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> have been resolved. `` Any time inventories rise, it's bad news. But the trade was looking for a rise in stocks of between 1,000 and 3,000 tons at the <ORGANIZATION> LME </ORGANIZATION>, and what they saw was somewhere in the neighborhood of 7,300 instead,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` That put some downside pressure on the market.'' Crude oil futures rose in the wake of a big decline late last week, but traders said there was little news to explain the runup. `` There's really no news and the vague blurbs we did here _ that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was increasing production, that the <ORGANIZATION> UAE </ORGANIZATION> would be above quota next month _ both were actually bearish,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritterbusch </PERSON>, vice president-trading and research for <ORGANIZATION> Carson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` I think most of the buying today might have come because the market did n't break,'' he said. `` And it points up that we're in a choppy, sideways market, casting around for some real news.'' Crude oil settled 21 cents to 48 cents higher on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with March at $ 17.59 a barrel; heating oil was .81 cent to .86 cent higher, with March at 48.17 cents a gallon; and unleaded gasoline was unchanged to .58 cent higher, with March at 48.15 cents a gallon. Grain and soybean futures prices came under pressure from the opening bell at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> and never recovered. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> said reports of rain in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> helped depress prices. Without any significant export business announcements, prices in the wheat and corn pits slid lower in sympathy. Wheat settled 2 cents to 4 cents lower, with the contract for delivery in March at $ 4.25 \ a bushel; corn was -RCB- cent to 1 \ cents lower, with March at $ 2.65 \ a bushel; oats were 1 \ cents to 2 -RCB- cents lower, with March at $ 2.04 \ a bushel; and soybeans were 7 cent to 12 cents lower, with March at Gold futures continued trending lower, although silver and platinum posted moderate gains. Gold settled $ 2 to $ 2.60 lower on the Comex, with February at $ 386.20 a troy ounce; silver rose 1.1 cent to 1.5 cents, with February at $ 5.826 a troy ounce. Platinum was 80 cents to $ 1.70 cents higher at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with March at $ 525.80 a troy ounce. Livestock futures were mixed to mostly higher, while pork futures were mixed to mostly lower at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .15 cent lower to .52 higher, with February at 74.60 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .23 cent to .60 cent higher, with March at 82.72 cents a pound; live hogs were .35 cent lower to .12 cent higher, with February at 41.42 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were .43 cent lower to .05 cent higher, with February at 38.05 cents a pound.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> opened a campaign for his `` sensible ideas'' federal budget Monday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, the state that revived his flagging campaign for the presidency one year earlier. Although <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s fiscal 1990 budget is under attack among congressional Democrats for lacking specifics on spending cuts, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> gave no hint in his speech to the <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> that the plan might be in trouble. `` Sensible ideas work,'' the president told a <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, audience of about 1,200 people. `` We can do the job without taxes,'' added <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has repeatedly promised to fight any new taxes. However, Sen. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, who hitched a ride back to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Air Force One, told reporters a tax increase of some form might be needed next year. `` No promise is forever,'' <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON> said. He predicted `` a good three months of heavy slugging'' on the budget. The president said his appearance was only the first in a series of stops around the country on behalf of his $ 1.16 trillion spending plan, which calls for restraints on defense spending but more money for education, environmental cleanup, the homeless and other domestic programs. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will fly to <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, to address a joint session of the state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>. On Friday, he is expected to speak in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. On Monday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> attended the swearing in of his Housing and <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> secretary, former Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a roomful of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> employees he is `` committed to equal housing opportunity for all our citizens,'' and `` strong enforcement of laws to end discrimination.'' He said he wanted to change the `` misguided policies'' that had seen `` whole neighborhoods boarded up'' and reiterated his support for full funding of the so-called <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> to help combat homelessness. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, who said home ownership is the `` most vivid symbol of the American Dream,'' pledged to help lead `` an all out public and private effort to help end the appalling tragedy of homelessness.'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said there will be two `` touchstones,'' of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, the first `` to adhere to the very highest standards of integrity, ethics and the law.'' `` Second, we all must keep our minds, our work and our hearts focused on those we are meant to serve _ not just the home builder, but the home buyer; not only public housing authorities, but the public housing resident; not just mayors and city managers, but the poor and those who live temporarily on the streets or in shelters.'' Meantime, on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s budget director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> met for nearly two hours with the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> budget committees. He rejected criticism of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> budget by those complaining it did n't spell out every detail of where cuts might be made. `` We recognize in the end we have to negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. Details left unspecified were those not as important to the president, and the new administration wants to demonstrate `` we're not rigid,'' he said. `` I think the White House is being more conciliatory,'' compared to the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> White House, said Sen. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>, D-Tenn., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> About $ 9.6 billion in domestic spending cuts were not specified in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> budget, <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said last week. Asked about taxes after Monday's meeting, he said: `` The subject did n't come up at our meeting.'' <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON> said <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> will meet again Tuesday with him and Reps. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, D-Calif., and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash. <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON> is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Majority The participants all said the meetings are akin to briefings and not negotiations _ something the congressional leadership has not yet agreed to begin. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stopped in <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, on the way back to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> from a vacation weekend at his seaside retreat in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. He had grateful words for <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> and its voters, saying his victory in the state's <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> primary on Feb. 16, 1988, `` gave me the chance to pick myself up off of that canvas.'' Reminiscing about the campaign, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` A year ago about this time I came to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> under quite different circumstances. I had just lost in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. I was up at 6:50 a.m., my first morning here, holding my coffee in one hand and shaking the hands of some of the guys at the factory with the other.'' `` The columnists had begun to write my political obituary,'' he added. New Hampshire Gov. <PERSON> Judd </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> joked that he wanted to extend to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a `` welcome back on his regular February visit.'' Former New Hampshire Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, now <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief of staff, was seated behind <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on the stage. Turning to his budget proposal, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` Our plan is a realistic one. It is a budget plan that will work, but not with business as usual. It will require a partnership with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s speech highlighted most major features of his budget plan. However, he did not mention one of its more controversial components _ a reduction of the tax on capital gains, which include profits from the sale of stock, homes, real estate and other assets. He contends such a tax break would actually raise revenues by spurring business investment, however <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> critics have called it a tax benefit mostly for the rich and have disputed the claim of increased revenues. As he had in his first major policy speech to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last Thursday night, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> promised `` to work day and night'' with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in coming to agreement on a plan that meets budget targets. `` There are some areas in which we would all like to spend more, but we can not until we get our fiscal house in order and bring the deficit down,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said.

It was the 11th savings and loan in the country to fall under the intervention program, aimed at stemming the tide of losses in the nation's thrift industry. Midwest Federal Chairman <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and its managing officer, <PERSON> Charlotte </PERSON> <PERSON> Massica </PERSON>, were named last week by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> as among the targets of an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation into possible fraud at <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Federal </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON>, <PERSON> Massica </PERSON> and two other <ORGANIZATION> Midwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> officials resigned Monday, federal officials said. Asked if the four executives had been fired, spokesman <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Honarmand </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION> home-loan bank said: `` You draw your own conclusions. The new management team wanted to make a fresh start.'' <PERSON> Honarmand </PERSON> did say, however, that auditors for the <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION> bank had not uncovered any illegalities at Midwest Federal. <PERSON> Honarmand </PERSON> said <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON> and other Midwest Federal executives were cooperative. <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON>, who has an unlisted home telephone number, could not be reached for comment. <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON> in the past has denied any wrongdoing by himself or any other any officer or employee of Midwest Federal. <PERSON> Thurman </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Connell </PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION> bank, said <ORGANIZATION> Midwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> will continue to operate normally while federal regulators determine the extent of its financial difficulties and devise a plan to solve them. <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Gravlee </PERSON>, deputy director of communications for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, said `` the most likely scenario'' for rescuing the thrift would include the use of federal funds. <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> banker <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Pohlad </PERSON> has proposed acquiring <ORGANIZATION> Midwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> with federal assistance, while others also have expressed interest in bidding for the thrift. Midwest Federal has $ 3.4 billion in assets and $ 2.3 billion in deposits. According to the <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION> bank, Monday's action was precipitated by a report from auditors that in the fourth quarter of 1988, <ORGANIZATION> Midwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> lost about $ 200 million from loans it purchased from <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tree </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acceptance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Midwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> <PERSON> Tree </PERSON>'s chief financial officer, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Brink </PERSON>, said in an interview Monday that he did n't understand how Midwest Federal could lose that amount on the loan package. `` It certainly is n't fair to blame all of Midwest Federal's problems on Green Tree Acceptance,'' <PERSON> Brink </PERSON> said <PERSON> Honarmand </PERSON> said the full amount of red ink at Midwest Federal will not be known until an audit of 1988's books is complete in a few weeks.

<HEAD>Security Forces Remove Strikers from Steel Mill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Security agents at a steel mill evicted several hundred strikers Monday to stop them from harassing people who continued working, official media and sources in the area reported. At least 1,000 people, most of them blast-furnace workers, walked off their jobs Sunday at the mill in <LOCATION> Zenica </LOCATION>. They demanded double wages for January compared with December, higher wages for night work and other special payments because of inflation now at an annual rate of about 300 percent. Several hundred <LOCATION> Zenica </LOCATION> workers marched to the town hall Sunday to press their demands. <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION>, the official news agency, said `` the mill's security forces evicted ... several hundred'' strikers Monday evening who were involved in minor skirmishes with people who stayed on the job. Its report was brief and did not say whether anyone was injured. It was believed to be the first such action by factory authorities in communist <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. Sources said on condition of anonymity that no one was seriously injured. They said security men `` literally pushed the strikers out of the factory gates.'' <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said mill authorities responded to `` the improper and rowdy behavior of some strikers which endangered the security of the people and the installations at the mill.'' The agency said the situation in the plant 90 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> became `` volatile'' when management announced Monday afternoon that it would not give in to the strikers' demands, <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> television said the factory produced 400 tons of steel less on Monday than in a usual day. It also showed some of the skirmishes between strikers and workers. About 22,000 people work at the mill, which was built after World War II and served as a symbol of communist industrial development until it began losing money in recent years. Nearly 2,000 strikes were reported in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> last year, most of them to protest lower living standards brought about by the nation's severe economic problems.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> charged Monday that journalists covering a federal trading-fraud investigation had `` trampled upon and smeared the integrity'' of the world's two largest futures exchanges. The <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement that the disclosure of the probe on Jan. 19 had sparked a `` media frenzy'' that had inflicted possibly irreversible damage on the futures industry. `` The unbridled race by some in the media to print and broadcast the most sensational and outlandish scrap of information has resulted in a denigration of all traders, regardless of guilt or innocence,'' the exchange said. `` Most importantly, it has viciously trampled upon and smeared the integrity of two <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> institutions ... their officials and their members in a manner that is unconscionable,'' the exchange said. The statement was signed by <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Geldermann </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Melamed </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> said neither it nor the rival <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> were targets of the investigation. The probe is believed to be focused on allegations that as many as 100 traders and brokers at the two exchanges systematically cheated customers out of millions of dollars in profits on contracts for future deliveries of commodities ranging from soybeans to <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds. Federal authorities in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> have refused to comment on the investigation. No indictments have yet been issued. The <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> said it would hold meetings this week to update members on its comprehensive review of the exchange's trading rules and practices. The review, launched in reaction to news of the investigation, is not slated for completion until at least late March.

<HEAD>Market Indicates Semiconductor Demand Increasing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CUPERTINO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Market figures for January indicate semiconductor demand is increasing for the first time in four months and that the contracting market may be slightly reversing itself, analysts said Monday. An increase in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> semiconductor orders caused a rise in the closely watched `` book-to-bill'' ratio for January, which reached 1.0, according to figures released by the <ORGANIZATION> Semiconductor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The figure was .93 in December. A book-to-bill ratio of 1.0 means that for every $ 100 worth of products billed, manufacturers received $ 100 worth of new orders, or bookings. The total shipments, or billings, of $ 1.004 million in January were 10.9 percent higher than the same figure a year ago and 17.1 percent lower than in December. The January 1989 orders, or bookings, of $ 1.124 million were 5.8 percent higher than the average bookings posted last year and 5.4 percent higher than December's figure. `` It means the industry is coming back toward a growth environment after four months with less than a one-to-one -LRB- ratio -RRB-, indicating a shrinking of the market and people buying less from September to now,'' said <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelps </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Hambrecht </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Quist investment company. `` This indicates for the first time they are beginning to order as much as is being produced,'' he said.

 Reality and make-believe mingled Monday at the annual American International Toy Fair as hundreds of toymakers touted their 1989 offerings to buyers from stores around the country. As usual, many manufacturers recruited colorful characters to catch the eyes of buyers and grab some free publicity. A rifle-toting <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> lookalike hawking a new board game was only a few feet from authentic protesters airing gripes against war toys, while real-life Olympic star <PERSON> Florence </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> <PERSON> Joyner </PERSON> pitched a new `` Flo Jo'' doll and developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> made a publicity-seeking appearance on behalf of a new board game bearing his name. Nearby on the Fifth Avenue sidewalk, a unicycle-riding clown and a life-sized green turtle _ that's human life, not amphibian life _ were among the crowd patrolled by police. The doyen of fashion dolls had a gala all her own Monday night. A shimmering pink carpet was rolled out in front of <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Center </LOCATION> for 1,200 guests attending <PERSON> Barbie </PERSON>'s `` Pink Jubilee.'' Several stage and television celebrities paid tribute to Barbie during a show commemorating her 30 years as a successful doll. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> sent her some fan mail. `` Barbie's appearance in a wide variety of ethnic guises makes her a great toy for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, a city which draws unique energy from its unparalleled ethnic diversity,'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> wrote in his letter. Elaborate promotions have become a tradition at Toy Fair, where each year an estimated 5,000 new toys debut. Countless items on display here will never make it to store shelves and many much-touted toys of 1988 were absent as the 10-day trade show opened its doors Monday. Amid all the hoopla, the industry reported business improved modestly in 1988 after several disappointing years. `` I believe I speak for many in the industry who feel encouraged by the performance of manufacturers in the past 12 months and are optimistic about prospects for the future,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalinske </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Toy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. One of the best omens is that publicly-held toy companies seem to have reversed their bad fortunes of 1987, <PERSON> Kalinske </PERSON> said at a news conference Together, those companies lost about $ 120 million in 1987. Last year, the same companies probably earned profits of around $ 120 million, according to the trade association. Retail toy sales rose to an estimated $ 12.75 billion in 1988 from $ 12.5 billion in 1987. The association's figures do n't include the roughly $ 2.3 billion in revenue for video games last year, most of which are foreign made. Although retail toy sales were virtually flat, the industry reported a 3.9 percent pickup in sales at the wholesale level. Manufacturers' shipments rose to $ 8.55 billion from $ 8.23 billion. Another good sign is that retailers are finding more customers shopping for toys all year, instead of only during the pre-Christmas buying binge, <PERSON> Kalinske </PERSON> said. A perennial problem for toymakers has been the reliance of their balance sheets on seasonal shopping: if economic activity temporarily falls off ahead of Christmas and causes consumers to spend cautiously, toy makers' revenues are endangered. In an effort to coax customers into buying toys throughout the year, manufacturers have emphasized items that appeal to adults as well as children. Sociologists say this an astute marketing strategy because families increasingly seemed to be staying home and engaging in group activities. Last year's popular games such as Pictionary, or previous successes such as Trivial Pursuit, benefited from this trend. Manufacturers also have had to account for the aging of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population, which is shrinking the market for children-only toys. But among the biggest challenge for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> toy industry is competition from video games, by far the biggest selling items over the past two years. While stores have reaped handsome returns from video games such as the <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> game system, the sales steered money away from other toys, mostly boys items. But some observers think that will change. `` I think the fad is concentrated with boys, ages 6 to 15, and it's my belief that segment is saturated,'' said toy analyst <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Valentine </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>New Coal Fields Worth $2.56 Billion Found In Malaysia, Says Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A West German team has found two coal deposits containing about 93 million tons of coal worth an estimated $ 2.56 billion, it was reported Tuesday. The two deposits were found in the Tebulan and Merit South areas of <LOCATION> Sarawak </LOCATION> state, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Straits </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported, quoting S.P. <PERSON> Chen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Sarawak </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Geological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Survey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> director. The coal is of the sub-bituminous type suitable for industrial use as fuel. The new areas are adjacent to the existing <LOCATION> Merit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pila </LOCATION> coal field, 180 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Kuching </LOCATION>, which was discovered last April and has about 63.7 million tons of coal worth more than $ 1.72 billion, <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> said the discovery was part of a $ 1.1 million-dollar survey being conducted by seven West German geologists since 1983. The seven are in <LOCATION> Sarawak </LOCATION> as part of a German technical aid program that ends in 1990. <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> said there were about 78 million tons of coal in the <LOCATION> Tebulan </LOCATION> area and 15 million tons in Merit South. Commercial mining at the <LOCATION> Merit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pila </LOCATION> coal field began last June by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Global </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mineral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exploration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and a Malaysian-South Korean joint venture, <ORGANIZATION> Lucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> said.
